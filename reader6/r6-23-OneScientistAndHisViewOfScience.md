I belong to the great family of scientists. 
Each of us knows that curious state of excitement during which nothing in life seems important but the problem on which we are working. 
The whole world becomes unreal and all our thoughts spin madly around the subjects of research. 
To the outsider we may look like idle creatures, lying comfortably about, but we well know that it is an exacting and tiring task that we perform. 
We may seem ridiculous when we fill sheets of paper with formulae and equations or when we use a strange language in our discussions, composed of words understandable only to the initiated. 
We may look for weeks or months or years for the right way to prove a theorem or perform an experiment, trying different pathways, wandering through darkness, knowing all the time that there must be a broad and comfortable highway leading to our goal. 
But man has little chance of finding it. 
We experience the ecstasy of discovery in very rare moments, divided from each other by long intervals of doubt, of painful and attractive research. 


We know these emotions so well that we hardly ever talk about them. 
And it does not even matter whether or not the problems on which we work are important. 
Each of us experiences these emotions whether he is Einstein or a student who, on his first piece of research, learns the taste of suffering, disappointment and joy. 


This knowledge binds us together. 
We enjoy long scientific talks which would seem to an outsider a torture hard to endure. 
Even if we work in similar fields we usually have different views, and we may stimulate each other by violent discussions. 
Every field of research is so specialized that often two mathematicians or two theoretical physicists fail to understand each others problems and methods. 
But even then they may feel the bonds created by research though they may gossip mostly about their colleagues, jobs and university life. 


There is a level below which our talks seldom sink. 
I have never heard among scientists the discussion of a frequent topic: &ldquo;Is science responsible for wars?&rdquo; 
We know, perhaps too well, how to avoid glittering generalities. 
For us Galileo&#39;s law is that of a falling stone for which we may substitute in our imagination a simple formula, but never a picture of a bomb dropped from an airplane, carrying destruction and death. 
To us a knife or a wheel is a great discovery which made the cutting of bread or the transportation of food easy, but we know too well that it is not our responsibility if the same discoveries have been applied to cutting human throats or manufacturing tanks. 
It is not the knife which kills. 
It is not even the hand which kills. 
It is the radiating source of hate which raises the armed hand and makes the tanks roll. 
We know all that. 


The family feeling among us dissipates and vanishes, however, once we leave scientific problems. 
We have our prejudices, our different social views, our different ethical standards. We are not angels. 
There are men among us, like Rupp in Germany, who have faked experiments; well-known physicists, like Lenard and Stark, who supported Hitler even before he came to power; mathematicians like Bieberbach, who distinguish between Aryan and Jewish mathematics; and aloof, kind, gentle and progressive men like Einstein, Bohr and Dirac. 


Scientists must employ logic, criticism, imagination in their research. 
As a relief, their brains relax as soon as they leave the domain of science. 
It is almost as though logic and good reasoning were too precious gifts to be employed outside scientific work. 


My generalizations are worth as much as all generalizations of this kind. 
They are gained by my own experience, from my contacts with scientists, from my own observation. 
They do not refer to individuals, but I believe they are valid when applied to a majority of scientists. 


These scientists are the product of their environment. 
They have not felt the impact of life. 
They would like to remain forever on their peaceful island, nursing the belief that no storm can reach their shores. 
They were brought up in a comfortable feeling of security and hope to retain it by closing their eyes to the struggle of the outside world. 
They have not strengthened the forces of reaction, but they have not fought them. 
Indifference has been their sin. They belong to those in Dante&#39;s Inferno

<blockquote>
    &hellip; who have their life pass&#39;d through \\
    If without infamy yet without praise;  \\
    And here they mingle with that caitiff crew  \\
    Of angels who, though not rebellious, were  \\
    Through neutral selfishness to God untrue. \\
</blockquote>

Slowly, very slowly, through years of bitter experience, some of us have discovered our tragic mistake. 
We cannot keep our eyes closed. 
It is not only the problem of the outside world which disturbs our sleep. 
We can no longer pretend that nothing has happened or that what has happened is not our concern. 
The storm comes too close to our shores. 
The waves have washed away many of us and destroyed some of the best laboratories on our island. 
We look with astonishment at a world which we never wanted to shape, trying to understand the forces of sudden and unforeseen destruction. 


The individual is no concern of nature. 
My story would be irrelevant if it were my story only. 
But it is not. 
I belong to the generation of scientists who were forced to view the world outside their island, who had to learn to ask: &ldquo;What are the forces which try to destroy science? 
How can we save our kingdom? 
How can we by our own efforts prevent or delay the decline of the world in which we live?&rdquo; 


We are not fighters; we care little for power; no great political leader has ever arisen from om* circle. 
Not one who has tasted research would exchange it for power. 
We are trained in too many doubts to employ force and to express unconditional belief. 
But in the fight against destruction our words and thoughts may count. 
We shall have to learn the use of words which will be understood, we shall have to sharpen our thoughts on problems which we have ignored before. 


The scientist tries to understand the origin of our solar system, the structure of the universe and the laws governing the atom. 
He has discovered X rays, the radioactive substances, and he has built cyclotrons. 
He has foreseen the existence of electromagnetic and electronic waves. 
Out of his thought has grown the technique of our century. 
But not until today has he begun to notice that the earth on which he moves is covered with sweat and with blood and that in the world in which he lives &ldquo;<em>the son of man has nowhere to lay his head</em>.&rdquo;
