The present understanding, imperfect but growing, of the fundamental nature of matter has come largely from observation of the elementary particles. 
The protons, neutrons, electrons, mesons and other particles reveal the most when they can be studied one at a time or when only two or three of them interact. 
When larger numbers are present, the sheer mathematical complexity of their interaction hides the fundamental simpHcities. 
For this reason the efforts of many experimental physicists over several decades have gone into the development of sensitive methods for detecting single particles. 


There is no single best design for a particle detector. 
To obtain certain characteristics it is usually necessary to sacrifice others, and the choice depends on the nature of the experimental &ldquo;events&rdquo; one wishes to observe. 
Physicists working with the large particle-accelerating machines have increasingly been concerned with extremely rare events, epitomized by the recent discovery at the Brookhaven National Laboratory that there are two kinds of neutrino rather than one [see &ldquo;Science and the Citizen,&rdquo; page 52]. 
To obtain the evidence for this discovery the 30-billion-electron-volt proton accelerator at Brookhaven was operated for six months. 
Over this period the number of recorded events caused by neutrinos averaged fewer than one every three days. 
The particle detector used in the experiment is of an entirely new type: it is called a spark chamber. 
Before explaining its operation I shall describe the general nature of the particle-detection problem. 
The problem is far from easy, because an elementary particle can pass freely through many atoms of any substance without leaving a trace. 
Even at present there is no practical device that can detect electrically neutral particles without destroying or deflecting them. 
Charged particles, however, exert a strong electrostatic force on the electrons of the atoms through which they pass. 
Usually the electrostatic force between the negative electron and the positive nucleus is enough to keep the electrons from breaking free, but occasionally&emdash;roughly once in every 1,000 atoms through which a charged particle passes&emdash;an electron is jolted loose.
In air, for example, about 100 electrons are freed along each centimeter of the path of a charged particle, and for each free electron a corresponding positive ion is formed. 
If the small amount of energy contained in this &ldquo;ionization trail&rdquo; can be made to produce some visible effect, the physicist can find out where the particle went. 
He can also measure the momentum of a particle by observing the radius of curvature of its track in a magnetic field, and he can obtain information about the way it interacts with other particles by observing sudden changes in direction of its track. 


In one of the first of all elementary particle experiments Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, working in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, detected the small energy of an ionization trail without amplification by using the extreme sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye. 
They observed the small flashes of light made when alpha particles went through certain crystalline materials called scintillators. 
From Geiger and Marsden&#39;s observations of the angles at which alpha particles scattered from a target into the scintillator, Ernest Rutherford concluded by 1913 that the positive charge of the atom was concentrated in a nucleus. 


A fast, singly charged particle&emdash;a cosmic ray meson, for example&emdash;produces only about a thousandth as many free electrons per millimeter of track as a slow, doubly charged alpha particle does. 
The detection of fast particles therefore requires some kind of amplification of the energy of the ionization trail. 
Since Rutherford&#39;s time the devices used to detect elementary particles have divided into two broad classes, both of which amplify. 
One class consists of &ldquo;counters.&rdquo; 
Every counter includes a sensitive volume of gas, liquid or solid with well-defined dimensions in space.  
When a charged particle passes through the sensitive volume, the counter produces a brief electric pulse, or signal. 
The pulses can be tallied electronically; hence the name &ldquo;counter.&rdquo; 


The other class does not have a well-recognized generic name, but it can be called the class of &ldquo;track detectors.&rdquo; 
A track detector shows where a charged particle went by indicating many points in space along the particle&#39;s ionization trail. 
Usually the information provided by a track detector is recorded by photography. 
In fact, for certain purposes stacks of photographic film or a single block of photographic emulsion can be used directly as a track detector. 
A charged particle sensitizes emulsion grains along its track and amplification is achieved by means of a chemical developer. 
In the next few years some advanced track detectors may be built that will put out information in the form of electrical signals. 


If one compares the two classes, it is apparent that the counter gives only a limited amount of information, but it gives it immediately in a simple form suitable for direct use in electronic circuits. 
In modern counters the information is often available in less than 10 nanoseconds (10 billionths of a second).
The track detector gives much more information, but the information goes into photographic emulsion, where it is unavailable until the emulsion is developed and analyzed. 
A counter with a sensitive volume of a cubic foot can only signal that a charged particle has passed somewhere within that cubic foot. 
Some track detectors with the same sensitive volume can indicate each point of the particle&#39;s path within a thousandth of a centimeter. 
The space resolution of the track detector balances against the reporting speed of the counter.

    A counter, which simply senses the arrival of a particle, triggers the movement of a piston that expands the gas and vapor inside the chamber. 
    This makes the vapor supersaturated, and fog droplets rapidly grow along the ionization trail left by passage of the particle.

In modern elementary-particle experiments the experimenter often wants to trace all or part of the life histories of particles entering his detectors. 
He wants to identify the mass, charge and frequently the energy of each particle that enters. 
In addition he wants to observe if and in what way the entering particles react with the atoms in his detector. 
If new particles are produced by reactions, he wants to measure the properties of these product particles and to see if they decay spontaneously into combinations of other particles. 
In most cases, the rarer the reaction, the greater its significance. 
Typically only one in many thousands of particles entering a detector will produce an interesting event. 
If the experimenter&#39;s apparatus includes track detectors, it is much to his advantage to use counters to select those events that are worth recording in the track detector. 
Otherwise he may have to search through hundreds of thousands of pictures to find the rare events of interest. 

%% TODO

The first successful track detector was the cloud chamber, invented by C. T. R. Wilson in 1911. 
Wilson recognized that a supersaturated vapor is unstable and that the vapor will condense into droplets around any available free ions. 
In cloud chambers (which are still used) a saturated vapor is maintained in a closed volume under well-controlled conditions of temperature and pressure. 
When a charged particle passes through the chamber, the ionization trail it leaves persists for a fraction of a second. 
Either before or directly after passing through the cloud chamber the particle traverses counters, which produce an electric pulse. 
The pulse, signaling the passage of a particle, is made to initiate the outward motion of a piston; this allows the gas inside the chamber to expand and renders the vapor in the gas supersaturated [see top illustration at left]. 
The vapor then begins to form droplets of fog, which condense around the ions of the charged-particle track. 
Droplets also tend to form around dust particles or droplets left over from a previous expansion. 
But under the right conditions (achieving them is rather tricky) there forms in the chamber, in a fraction of a second, a clear trail of vapor droplets, which shows with good fidelity the path of the particle that triggered the counters. 
The advantage of the cloud chamber is that it can be triggered. 
A chamber may remain idle for hours waiting for a rare cosmic ray event, but when the event occurs and is recognized by the counters, the chamber operates on demand to record it. 


Unfortunately cloud chambers have two rather serious drawbacks. 
First, the device is slow to set in operation, and the ionization trails persist for a large fraction of a second. 
As a result the number of incoming particles must be limited to prevent chamber pictures from being cluttered with more tracks than one can &ldquo;read.&rdquo; 
The second drawback is the difficulty of putting into the chamber materials with which one might like to see particles interact. 
If material is introduced in the form of plates, the plates must be relatively few and widely spaced; otherwise the chamber will not work. 
If much material is needed, it must therefore be in the form of thick plates, with the result that interactions tend to occur deep in the plates, where the tracks cannot be seen. 
It is rather like Greek tragedy, in which all the mayhem occurs offstage and the audience is treated only to a secondhand account of it. 


In the early 1950&#39;s Donald A. Glaser, then at the University of Michigan, developed a new type of track detector, the bubble chamber, for which he received a Nobel prize in 1960. 
This detector is also based on an amplification principle&emdash;the growth of bubbles in a superheated liquid. 
Some of the energy from an ionization trail goes into a few fast electrons, which can give up 1,000 or 2,000 volts of energy in a small volume to produce rapid local heating. 
If the trail is in a liquid that has suddenly been superheated by expansion, the bubbles will tend to grow fastest along the &ldquo;heat track&rdquo; and only slowly in other parts of the liquid. 
Glaser&#39;s invention was soon in use in many laboratories throughout the world, and it is safe to say that by 1959 more than half of all experimental research in elementary particle physics employed the bubble chamber. 


An important virtue of Glaser&#39;s device is that one can fill the chamber with a wide variety of liquids, choosing the one that provides interactions of particular interest. 
For many purposes liquid hydrogen is ideal because it presents as a target for incoming particles only electrons and protons. 
In all other substances neutrons are also present. 
Other useful liquids are propane&emdash;in which the target atoms are carbon and hydrogen&emdash;and xenon, whose massive nucleus (54 protons and 77 neutrons) provides high stopping power. 
In addition the bubble chamber produces particle tracks of higher definition than those made by any other track detector, except for tracks made directly in photographic emulsion. 


The bubble chamber shares with the emulsion method one serious disadvantage: it cannot be triggered. 
Since there is no way to select rare events one has no choice but to photograph the chamber at every expansion cycle, develop the films and examine hundreds or thousands of exposures looking for events of interest. 
Triggering is impossible because the heat track produced by a charged particle cools down in much less than a millionth of a second. 
This is far too short a time for the mechanical expansion system to set the chamber in operation. 
As a result bubble chambers are used almost exclusively with large accelerators, where a timing sequence first expands the chamber, then sends in a burst of particles to be analyzed [see bottom illustration on page 38]. 
The chamber must then be given about a second in which to recover.

Unlike the cloud chamber and the bubble chamber, the spark chamber was the work of many hands. 
Its development was based on one of the most spectacular methods known for making, ionization trails visible&emdash;the electiic spark. 
The generation of an electric spark is an extremelv complicated process, but it is clear that under some conditions a spark can develop from a type of chain reaction. 
The reaction starts when an electron from an ionized atom, accelerated by a strong electric field, bumps into and ionizes other atoms. 
The electrons from these atoms cause further ionizations, leading in a very brief time to a brilliant electric spark. 
In 1928 the amplification process available in the electric spark was used in the first of all electrical detectors for single charged particles, the Geiger-Miiller counter. 
In this simple device, named for Hans Geiger and Walther Miiller, a central wire inside a tube is charged to high voltage. 
When a particle goes through the counter, the electrons of its ionization track are swept toward the wire. 
Accelerating as they approach the wire&#39;s strong field, they ionize more atoms. 
The ionized atoms emit photons (light quanta), which release additional electrons from the gas, spreading the discharge. 
Within millionths of a second the gas all along the center wire serves as the path for an electric spark. 
Geiger counters make tremendous pulses, which was a great virtue when sensitive electronic amplifiers were still diflRcult to build. 


In the 1930&#39;s the standard equipment of the elementary-particle physicist consisted of a cloud chamber triggered by Geiger counters. 
In the late 1940&#39;s, when Geiger counters had been generally superseded by the development of scintillation counters (faster and capable of giving more information), a few physicists began trying to use the mechanism of the electric spark in a detector that would make visible the track&emdash;not just the presence— of a charged particle.
J. W. Keuffel, working at the California Institute of Technology and later at Princeton University, built several spark counters, consisting of well-polished condenser plates kept at high voltage. 
If the plates were carefully aligned, clean and dust-free, and maintained just below the potential needed for a spark to jump between them, thev would sometimes spark preferentially along the trail of an incoming cosmic ray particle. 
Keuffel suggested the use of arrays of his parallel-plate spark counters to obtain tracks of the passage of a charged particle, but these counters were so difficult to build and to operate that it was not easy to follow up the suggestion. 


In 1955 M. Conversi and A. Gozzini described in the Italian physics journal Nuovo Cimento an intermediate type of track chamber somewhat similar to the Keuffel spark counter. 
Their device, called a hodoscope chamber, consisted of many neon-filled glass tubes stacked between two parallel metal plates [see bottom illustration on opposite page]. 
Within a few millionths of a second after the passage of a charged particle through the stack of tubes, a set of counters outside the stack triggered an electronic circuit that placed a strong electric field on the tubes. 
Those through which the particle had passed then glowed, much as a neon sign glows. 
Other tubes remained dark if the applied pulse was on for only a short time. 
The hodoscope chamber was fairly easy to build, and its inventors had introduced a technique that was essential for the development of spark chambers: the use of counters to pulse the electric field. 
In their chamber the high voltage was on only when they were sure a particle track was there to be photographed. 
If the high voltage had been left on continuously, as it was in the earlier spark counters, some neon tubes would eventually have fired even in the absence of an entering track. 
The chief defect of the hodoscope was that it revealed only two dimensions of a particle&#39;s three-dimensional path. 


In 1957 two British physicists, T. E.  Cranshaw and J. F. de Beer, reported in Nuovo Cimento the next step toward a practical spark chamber. 
They combined the parallel-plate geometry of the spark counter with the pulse-triggering technique of the hodoscope chamber to make an efficient spark chamber with six one-millimeter gaps. 
They also introduced the use of a continuous electric clearing field to remove from the chamber ionization trails older than a few microseconds. 
This electric field, well below the threshold needed to make a spark, caused a slow continuous drift to the plates of all free electrons and ions released in the chamber gas. 
In this way it &ldquo;erased&rdquo; ionization trails in a few microseconds. 
A similar clearing field had long been used in cloud chambers to sweep out the slowmoving positive ions. 


It happened that Cranshaw and de Beer chose to use air rather than neon in their chamber, and this small difference made it impossible for their chamber to detect two or more simultaneous tracks. 
Still, their work was so successful that several other groups&emdash;in Germany, Japan, the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.-continued to work along similar lines. 


The final step&emdash;substitution of neon for air-was taken by S. Fukui and S. Miyamoto of Osaka University and reported in 1959. 
The two Japanese physicists were interested in developing a track detector that could be used for cosmic rays. 
Bubble chambers are not useful for such work, since they cannot be triggered. 
Fukui and Miyamoto found that in a chamber containing neon rather than air several simultaneous particle tracks could be seen. 


One big difference between the behavior of air and of neon in spark chambers is that oxygen molecules (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>) in air can combine with the free electrons of the ionization trail, whereas neon atoms cannot. 
The inertness of neon&emdash;and of other &ldquo;noble&rdquo; gases&emdash;is explained by the fact that it has a full complement of eight electrons in its outer electron shell. 
In contrast an oxygen molecule can acquire one electron and thereby become a negative ion (0<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus</sup>). 
The electrons are well anchored to the oxygen molecules, some 60,000 times more massive than themselves, and cannot be freed except by application of a strong electric field. 



Consequently an air-filled spark chamber requires an operating pulse of 7,000 to 10,000 volts for each millimeter of space between its plates. 
This is about three times the voltage needed for a neon spark chamber. 


The formation of oxygen ions also explains other characteristics of an air spark chamber. 
If the electron in an ionization trail can migrate freely to the plates of the chamber, its travel time is brief. 
But if it is attached to an oxygen molecule along the way, the velocity of the resulting ion is much slower than that of the electron. 
In fact, if the mass of a particle is suddenly increased by 60,000 times, its velocity must decrease by the square root of 60,000, or by a factor of about 250. 
Because most of the electrons liberated in an air spark chamber are slowed down in this fashion, they require many microseconds to migrate to the plates of the chamber. 
Such a chamber therefore remains sensitive for a long time, and in it old tracks cannot be quickly erased. 


It is not so clear why air chambers show only one spark per gap even though several ionization trails may be present. 
It may be that at the high electric fields needed to operate such chambers the spark produced by the first electron freed from an oxygen ion occurs so rapidly that the plates are quickly discharged below the threshold field, preventing any other attached electrons from getting free to start other sparks. 
This is consistent with an observation by Cranshaw and de Beer that only one electron is needed to start the spark.

Following the announcement of a practical spark chamber by Fukui and Miyamoto in 1959, the idea was immediately taken up by physicists in the U.S. and elsewhere. 
Within a matter of months Bruce Cork of the University of California had built a six-gap spark chamber and had operated it in a beam of particles from the six-billion-electron-volt accelerator of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. 
Almost simultaneously James L. Cronin of Princeton University built and operated a large 18-gap spark chamber, which yielded high-quality pictures of the tracks made by cosmic rays and by accelerator-produced particles. 
Both of these chambers used noble gases (neon or argon) and employed clearing fields to erase the ionization trails. 
Cork and Cronin were also the first to conduct actual experiments using a spark chamber as a particle detector. 

In their work, as in most subsequent experiments using spark chambers, the occurrence of an interesting event was recognized by a system of conventional counters, which then triggered the operation of the chamber. 
Typically particles arrived at the spark chamber at intervals of a few microseconds and their tracks were swept to the plates by the continuous clearing field after only one microsecond. 
Consequently the pulsing of the spark chamber had to be carried out in much less than one microsecond so that the interesting track would still be there to be detected bv spark amplification.

Within the past three years a wide variety of spark chambers have been built, each designed to exploit certain desirable features. 
Some have been made with thick carbon plates to allow interactions of the incoming particles with carbon. 
Others have been built in the form of a cylinder, to study the scattering of particles by a target located on the axis of the cylinder.

Along with several other physicists, I have been particularly interested in the design and use of thin-plate spark chambers that can be operated in a magnetic field. 
In a uniform magnetic field the path of a charged particle of constant energy is a circle whose radius is proportional to the momentum of the particle. 
The idea of using a magnetic field to obtain momentum information goes back to the early days of the cloud chamber, and bubble chambers are nearly always operated in such a field. 
The measurement of the momentum of each charged particle in a reaction is alwavs useful, and frequently essential, for identifving the particles and learning the details of their interactions. 


When a magnetic field is used in a spark chamber, the sparks trace the ionization trails more closely if the spacing between the chamber plates is small. 
As the spacing is reduced, however, it becomes increasingly important for the plates to be flat and uniformly spaced, and the triggering pulse has to rise from zero to the peak voltage at higher speed. 
Fukui and Miyamoto had used spacings of 10 millimeters. 
Cork&#39;s chamber had a six-millimeter spacing. 
Within a few months we found in our laboratory at Princeton University that the spacing between spark-chamber plates operated in neon could be as small as two millimeters. 


Unless very close plate-spacing is wanted, the construction of a spark chamber is not too difficult and might make a feasible project for an amateur scientist. 
A chamber with an adjustable plate spacing of two to 10 millimeters, the first model built by our group, was largely the work of college sophomores majoring in physics. 
Our second instrument was small but operated in a magnetic field. 
It contained 50 gaps of three millimeters each, separated by aluminum foil a thousandth of an inch thick. 
A third chamber, with 128 gaps of three-millimeter spacing and a volume of two cubic feet, can measure the momentum of particles with good accuracy. 
When the tracks cross 100 or more gaps, the accuracy of momentum measurement approaches that obtainable in a good bubble chamber. 


At present the advantages the bubble chamber retains over the spark chamber are two. 
First, pure liquid hydrogen can be used as the only material in the bubble chamber, thereby limiting nuclear reactions to those between elementary particles and hydrogen nuclei (protons). 
In 1960 we studied the possibility of imitating a hydrogen bubble chamber by using liquid-hydrogen-filled hollow plates in an atmosphere of gaseous helium. 
We established that such a chamber would work but so far no one has needed its properties badly enough to build one. 
The second advantage of the bubble chamber is that it yields very fine ionization trails, and it produces them no matter which way the particle is moving. 
The bubbles trace a particle&#39;s path with an uncertainty of less than a thousandth of an inch. 
Even in narrow-gap spark chambers the sparks scatter in a region 15 or 20 thousandths of an inch wide. 
Moreover, in a spark chamber the path uncertainty increases as the particle approaches a course parallel to the plates. 


In spite of these drawbacks the spark chamber has two big advantages over the bubble chamber. 
First, the decision to photograph a given event can be made after the event has occurred. 
Second, because old ionization trails are swept to the walls after only one or two microseconds the spark chamber picture shows only the tracks produced during the last microsecond before the chamber was pulsed. 
Because of these two features one can select and photograph an interesting event caused by a single entering particle out of many thousands, all arriving over a few thousandths of a second. 
Each ionization trail of the uninteresting majority of tracks is swept away and does not remain to confuse the picture. 


The decision as to which events to photograph is made by &ldquo;logic&rdquo; circuits that analyze the output of counters, which may be located outside or inside the spark chamber itself. 
Frequently the logic requirements are severe and the pulses from many counters must be digested and analyzed before a decision is made whether to pulse the chamber or not. 
Ordinarily a time of about 100 nanoseconds (100 billion ths of a second) is available for the decision. 
This is not uncomfortably short with present-day circuitry. 
For the past 10 years it has been practical to use circuits that operate in 20 nanoseconds or less. 


Those of us who have jumped on the spark chamber bandwagon are naturally enthusiastic about future prospects for the instrument. 
We have found that physicists who formerly used bubble chambers are delighted to have a device that eliminates great masses of uninteresting pictures. 
And former counter physicists are happy to see the tracks they knew were going through their counters. 
We all know that neither bubble chambers nor counters are going to be put out of business by the new track detectors, but to a remarkable degree spark chambers allow us some of the best of both worlds.
