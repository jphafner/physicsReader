title: The Fall of Parity
author: Martin Gardner 
excerpt: Until 1956 the laws of physics included no preference for &ldquo;right-handedness&rdquo; or &ldquo;left-handedness.&rdquo; 
    But in 1956 the &ldquo;law of parity&rdquo; failed in experiments involving elementary particles, indicating that the universe is in some sense asymmetric. 
intro: Chapter from his book, <em>The Ambidextrous Universe</em>, published in 1964.

As far as anyone knows at present, all events that take place in the universe are governed by four fundamental types of forces (physicists prefer to say &ldquo;interactions&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;forces,&rdquo; but there is no harm in using here the more common term): 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Nuclear force. 
    \item Electromagnetic force. 
    \item Weak interaction force. 
    \item Gravitational force. 
\end{enumerate}

The forces are listed in decreasing order of strength. 
The strongest, nuclear force, is the force that holds together the protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. 
It is often called the &ldquo;binding energy&rdquo; of the nucleus. 
Electromagnetism is the force that binds electrons to the nucleus, atoms into molecules, molecules into liquids and solids. 
Gravity, as we all know, is the force with which one mass attracts another mass; it is the force chiefly responsible for binding together the substances that make up the earth. 
Gravitational force is so weak that unless a mass is enormously large it is extremely difficult to measure. On the level of the elementary particles its influence is negligible. 


The remaining force, the force involved in &ldquo;weak interactions,&rdquo; is the force about which the least is known. 
That such a force must exist is indicated by the fact that in certain decay interactions involving particles (such as beta-decay, in which electrons or positrons are shot out from radioactive nuclei), the speed of the reaction is much slower than it would be if either nuclear or electromagnetic forces were responsible. 
By &ldquo;slow&rdquo; is meant a reaction of, say, one ten-billionth of a second. 
To a nuclear physicist this is an exceedingly lazy effect&emdash;about a ten-trillionth the speed of reactions in which nuclear force is involved. 
To explain this lethargy it has been necessary to assume a force weaker than electromagnetism but stronger than the extremely weak force of gravity. 


The &ldquo;theta tau puzzle,&rdquo; over which physicists scratched their heads in 1956, arose in connection with a weak interaction involving a &ldquo;strange particle&rdquo; called the K-meson. 
(Strange particles are a class of recently discovered particles called &ldquo;strange&rdquo; because they do not seem to fit in anywhere with any of the other particles.) 
There appeared to be two distinct types of K-mesons. 
One, called the theta meson, decayed into two pi mesons. The other, called the tau meson, decayed into three pi mesons. 
Nevertheless, the two types of K-mesons seemed to be indistinguishable from each other. 
They had precisely the same mass, same charge, same lifetime. 
Physicists would have liked to say that there was only one K-meson; sometimes it decayed into two, sometimes into three pi mesons. 
Why didn&#39;t they? 
Because it would have meant that parity was not conserved. 
The theta meson had even parity. 
A pi meson has odd parity. 
Two pi mesons have a total parity that is even, so parity is conserved in the decay of the theta meson. 
But three pi mesons have a total parity that is odd. 


Physicists faced a perplexing dilemma with the following horns: 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item They could assume that the two K-mesons, even though indistinguishable in properties, were really two different particles: the theta meson with even parity, the tau meson with odd parity. 
    \item They could assume that in one of the decay reactions parity was not conserved. 
\end{enumerate}

To most physicists in 1956 the second horn was almost unthinkable. 
As we saw in Chapter 20, it would have meant admitting that the left-right symmetry of nature was being violated; that nature was showing a bias for one type of handedness. 
The conservation of parity had been well established in all &ldquo;strong&rdquo; interactions (that is, in the nuclear and electromagnetic interactions). 
It had been a fruitful concept in quantum mechanics for thirty years. 


In April, 1956, during a conference on nuclear physics at the University of Rochester, in New York, there was a spirited discussion of the theta-tau puzzle. 
Richard Phillips Feynman,\cite{} a physicist at the California Institute of Technology, raised the question: Is the law of parity sometimes violated? 
In corresponding with Feynman, he has given me some of the details behind this historic question. 
They are worth putting on record.  
The question had been suggested to Feynman the night before by Martin Block, an experimental physicist with whom Feynman was sharing a hotel room. 
The answer to the theta-tau puzzle, said Block, might be very simple. 
Perhaps the lovely law of parity does not always hold. 
Feynman responded by pointing out that if this were true, there would be a way to distinguish left from right. 
It would be surprising, Feynman said, but he could think of no way such a notion conflicted with known experimental results. 
He promised Block he would raise the question at next day s meeting to see if anyone could find anything wrong with the idea. 
This he did, prefacing his remarks with &ldquo;I am asking this question for Martin Block.&rdquo; 
He regarded the notion as such an interesting one that, if it turned out to be true, he wanted Block to get credit for it. 


Chen Ning Yang and his friend Tsung Dao Lee, two young and brilliant Chinese-born physicists, were present at the meeting. 
One of them gave a lengthy reply to Feynman&#39;s question. 

&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; Block asked Feynman later. 

&ldquo;I don&#39;t know,&rdquo; replied Feynman. &ldquo;I couldn&#39;t understand it.&rdquo; 

&ldquo;People teased me later,&rdquo; writes Feynman, &ldquo;and said my prefacing remark about Martin Block was made because I was afraid to be associated with such a wild idea. 
I thought the idea unlikely, but possible, and a very exciting possibility. 
Some months later an experimenter, Norman Ramsey, asked me if I believed it worth while for him to do an experiment to test whether parity is violated in beta decay. 
I said definitely yes, for although I felt sure that parity would not be violated, there was a possibility it would be, and it was important to find out. 
&#39;Would you bet a hundred dollars against a dollar that parity is not violated?&#39; 
he asked. &#39;No. But fifty dollars I will.&#39; 
&#39;That&#39;s good enough for me. I&#39;ll take your bet and do the experiment.&#39; 
Unfortunately, Ramsey didn&#39;t find time to do it then, but my fifty dollar check may have compensated him slightly for a lost opportunity.&rdquo; 


During the summer of 1956 Lee and Yang thought some more about the matter. 
Early in May, when they were sitting in the White Rose Cafe near the corner of Broadway and 125th Street, in the vicinity of Columbia University, it suddenly struck them that it might be profitable to make a careful study of all known experiments involving weak interactions. 
For several weeks they did this. 
To their astonishment they found that although the evidence for conservation of parity was strong in all strong interactions, there was no evidence at all for it in the weak. 
Moreover, they thought of several definitive tests, involving weak interactions, which would settle the question one way or the other. 
The outcome of this work was their now-classic paper &ldquo;Question of Parity Conservation in Weak Interactions.&rdquo; 


&ldquo;To decide unequivocally whether parity is conserved in weak interactions,&rdquo; they declared, &ldquo;one must perform an experiment to determine whether weak interactions differentiate the right from the left. 
Some such possible experiments will be discussed.&rdquo; 


Publication of this paper in <em>The Physical Review</em> (October 1, 1956) aroused only mild interest among nuclear physicists. 
It seemed so unlikely that parity would be violated that most physicists took the attitude: Let someone else make the tests. 
Freeman J. Dyson, a physicist now at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, writing on &ldquo;Innovation in Physics&rdquo; (<em>Scientific American</em>, September 1958) had these honest words to say about what he called the &ldquo;blindness&rdquo; of most of his colleagues. 


&ldquo;A copy of it [the Lee and Yang paper] was sent to me and I read it. 
I read it twice. I said. 
`This is very interesting,&#39; or words to that effect. 
But I had not the imagination to say, `By golly, if this is true it opens up a whole new branch of physics.&#39; 
And I think other physicists, with very few exceptions, at that time were as unimaginative as I.&rdquo;


Several physicists were prodded into action by the suggestions of Lee and Yang. 
The first to take up the gauntlet was Madame Chien-Shiung Wu, a professor of physics at Columbia University and widely regarded as the world&#39;s leading woman physicist. 
She was already famous for her work on weak interactions and for the care and elegance with which her experiments were always designed. 
Like her friends Yang and Lee, she, too, had been born in China and had come to the United States to continue her career. 


The experiment planned by Madame Wu involved the beta-decay of cobalt-60, a highly radioactive isotope of cobalt which continually emits electrons. 
In the Bohr model of the atom, a nucleus of cobalt 60 may be thought of as a tiny sphere which spins like a top on an axis labeled north and south at the ends to indicate the magnetic poles. 
The beta-particles (electrons) emitted in the weak interaction of beta-decay are shot out from both the north and the south ends of nuclei. 
Normally, the nuclei point in all directions, so the electrons are shot out in all directions. 
But when cobalt-60 is cooled to near absolute zero (\num{-273} degrees on the centigrade scale), to reduce all the joggling of its molecules caused by heat, it is possible to apply a powerful electromagnetic field which will induce more than half of the nuclei to line up with their north ends pointing in the same direction. 
The nuclei go right on shooting out electrons. 
Instead of being scattered in all directions, however, the electrons are now concentrated in two directions: the direction toward which the north ends of the magnetic axes are pointing, and the direction toward which the south ends are pointing. 
If the law of parity is not violated, there will be just as many electrons going one way as the other. 


To cool the cobalt to near absolute zero, Madame Wu needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards, in Washington, D. C. It was there that she and her colleagues began their historic experiment. 
If the number of electrons divided evenly into two sets, those that shot north and those that shot south, parity would be preserved. 
The theta-tau puzzle would remain puzzling. 
If the beta-decay process showed a handedness, a larger number of electrons emitted in one direction than the other, parity would be dead. 
A revolutionary new era in quantum theory would be under way. 


At Zurich, one of the world&#39;s greatest theoretical physicists, Wolfgang Pauli, eagerly awaited results of the test. 
In a now famous letter to one of his former pupils, Victor Frederick Weisskopf (then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Pauli wrote: &ldquo;I do not believe that the Lord is a weak left-hander, and I am ready to bet a very high sum that the experiments will give symmetric results.&rdquo; 


Whether Pauli (who died in 1958) actually made (like Feynman) such a bet is not known. 
If he did, he also lost. 
The electrons in Madam Wu&#39;s experiment were not emitted equally in both directions. 
Most of them were flung out from the south end; that is, the end toward which a majority of the cobalt-60 nuclei pointed their south poles. 


At the risk of being repetitious, and possibly boring readers who see at once the full implication of this result, let us pause to make sure we understand exactly why Madam Wu&#39;s experiment is so revolutionary. 
It is true that the picture (Figure 62) 

<figure>
\label{fig:62}
\caption{An electron is more likely to be flung out from the south end of a cobalt-60 nucleus than from its north end. }
</figure>

of the cobalt-60 nucleus, spinning in a certain direction around an axis labeled <span class="math">N</span> and <span class="math">S</span>, is an asymmetric structure not superposable on its mirror image. 
But this is just a picture. 
As we have learned, the labeling of <span class="math">N</span> and <span class="math">S</span> is purely conventional. 
There is nothing to prevent one from switching <span class="math">N</span> and <span class="math">S</span> on all the magnetic fields in the universe. 
The north ends of cobalt-60 nuclei would become south, the south ends north, and a similar exchange of poles would occur in the electromagnetic field used for lining up the nuclei. 
Everything prior to Madame Wu&#39;s experiment suggested that such a switch of poles would not make a measurable change in the experimental situation. 
If there were some intrinsic, observable difference between poles&emdash;one red and one green, or one strong and one weak&emdash;then the labeling of <span class="math">N</span> and <span class="math">S</span> would be more than a convention. 
The cobalt-60 nuclei would possess true spatial asymmetry. 
But physicists knew of no way to distinguish between the poles except by testing their reaction to other magnetic axes. 
In fact, as we have learned, the poles do not really exist. 
They are just names for the opposite sides of a spin. 


Madame Wu&#39;s experiment provided for the first time in the history of science a method of labeling the ends of a magnetic axis in a way that is not at all conventional. 
<em>The south end is the end of a cobalt-60 nucleus that is most likely to fling out an electron!</em>


The nucleus can no longer be thought of as analogous to a spinning sphere or cylinder. 
It must now be thought of as analogous to a spinning cone. 
Of course, this is no more than a metaphor. 
No one has the slightest notion at the moment of why or how one end of the axis is different, in any intrinsic way, from the other. 
But there is a difference! 
&ldquo;We are no longer trying to handle screws in the dark with heavy gloves,&rdquo; was the way Sheldon Penman of the University of Chicago put it (<em>Scientific American</em>, July 1961), &ldquo;we are being handed the screws neatly aligned on a tray, with a little searchlight on each that indicates the direction of its head.&rdquo; 


It should be obvious now that here at long last is a solution to the Ozma problem&emdash;an experimental method of extracting from nature an unambiguous definition of left and right. 
We say to the scientists of Planet X: &ldquo;Cool the atoms of cobalt-60 to near absolute zero. 
Line up their nuclear axes with a powerful magnetic field. 
Count the number of electrons flung out by the two ends of the axes. 
The end that flings out the most electrons is the end that we call `south.&#39; 
It is now possible to label the ends of the magnetic axis of the field used for lining up the nuclei, and this in turn can be used for labeling the ends of a magnetic needle. 
Put such a needle above a wire in which the current moves away from you. 
The north pole of this needle will point in the direction we call `left.&#39; &rdquo; 


We have communicated precisely and unambiguously to Planet X our meaning of the word `left.&#39; 
Neither we nor they will be observing in common any single, particular asymmetric structure. 
We will be observing in common a universal law of nature. 
In the weak interactions, nature herself, by her own intrinsic handedness, has provided an operational definition of left and right! 
It is easy to understand why Pauli and other physicists did not expect Madame Wu&#39;s experiment to overthrow parity. 
It would have meant that nature is not ambidextrous ! 


In the context of my Esquire tale about left and right, the cobalt-60 experiment provides a method by which the puzzled astronauts could tell whether they were reversed. 
Of course they would have to find some cobalt on the unknown planet, convert it to its radioactive isotope by bombarding it with neutrons, and so on. 
But assuming that they had the equipment and could find the necessary materials, they would be able to test their handedness. 


Similarly, Madame Wu&#39;s experiment clearly violates the assertion that all natural events can be photographed on motion picture film and projected in reversed form without the viewer being the wiser. 


<span class="textsc">Exercise 16</span>:
<em>Explain precisely how an observation of all details of the cobalt-60 experiment, when viewed as a projected motion picture, would enable one to tell whether the film had been reversed</em>.


Although evidence against the conservation of parity was strongly indicated by Madame Wu&#39;s work in late 1956, the experiment was not finally completed until early in January 1957. 
Results were formally announced by Columbia University&#39;s distinguished physicist Isador Rabi on January 15, 1957. 
The announcement also included the results of a confirming experiment conducted by Columbia physicists at the Nevis Cyclotron Laboratories at Irvington-on-Hudson in Westchester County, New York. 
This confirming test, made with mu mesons, showed an even stronger handedness. 
The mu mesons shot out twice as many electrons in one direction as in the other. 
Independent of both experiments, a third test was made at the University of Chicago using the decay of pi and mu mesons. 
It, too, showed violation of parity. 
All over the world physicists began testing parity in other weak interactions. 
By 1958 it was apparent that parity is violated in all such interactions. 
The theta-tau puzzle was solved. 
There is only one K-meson, Parity is not conserved. 


&ldquo;A rather complete theoretical structure has been shattered at the base,&rdquo; declared Rabi (quoted by the <em>New York Times</em>, January 16, 1957), &ldquo;and we are not sure how the pieces will be put together.&rdquo; 
An unnamed physicist was reported by the Times as saying that nuclear physics had been battering for years at a closed door only to discover suddenly that it wasn&#39;t a door at all&emdash;just a picture of a door painted on a wall. Now, he continued, we are free to look around for the true door.
O. R. Frisch, the physicist who was a co-discoverer of nuclear fission, reports in his book Atomic Physics Today (Basic, 1961) that on January 16, 1957, he received the following air letter from a friend: 

<blockquote>
    Dear Robert: 

    <span class="textsc">Hot News</span>.
    Parity is not conserved. 
    Here in Princeton they talk about nothing else; they say it is the most important result since the Michelson experiment &hellip;  
</blockquote>


The Michelson experiment was the famous Michelson-Morley test in 1887 which established the constant velocity of light regardless of the motion of source and observer&emdash;a historic experiment which paved the way for Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity. 
Madame Wu&#39;s experiment may well prove to be equally historic. 

The two tests were very much alike in their shattering element of surprise. 
Everybody expected Albert Michelson and Edward Morley to detect a motion of the earth relative to a fixed &ldquo;ether.&rdquo; 
It was the negative result of this test that was so upsetting. 
Everybody expected Madame Wu to find a left-right symmetry in the process of beta-decay. 
Nature sprang another surprise! It was surprising enough that certain particles had a handedness; it was more surprising that handedness seemed to be observable only in weak interactions. 
Physicists felt a shock even greater than Mach had felt when he first encountered the needle-and-wire asymmetry. 


&ldquo;Now after the first shock is over,&rdquo; Pauli wrote to Weisskopf on January 27, after the staggering news had reached him, &ldquo;I begin to collect myself. 
Yes, it was very dramatic. 
On Monday, the twenty-first, at 8 p.m. I was supposed to give a lecture on the neutrino theory. 
At 5 p.m. I received three experimental papers [reports on the first three tests of parity]&hellip; .
I am shocked not so much by the fact that the Lord prefers the left hand as by the fact that he still appears to be left-handed symmetric when he expresses himself strongly. 
In short, the actual problem now seems to be the question: Why are strong interactions right-and-left symmetric? 


The Indian physicist Abdus Salam (from whose article on &ldquo;Elementary Particles&rdquo; in Endeavor, April 1958, the extracts from Pauli&#39;s letters are taken) tried to explain to a liberal-arts-trained friend why the physicists were so excited about the fall of parity. 
&ldquo;I asked him,&rdquo; wrote Salam in this article, &ldquo;if any classical writer had ever considered giants with only the left eye. 
He confessed that one-eyed giants have been described, and he supplied me with a full list of them; but they always sport their solitary eye in the middle of the forehead. 
In my view, what we have found is that space is a weak left-eyed giant.&rdquo; 


Physicist Jeremy Bernstein, in an article on &ldquo;A Question of Parity&rdquo; which appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em>, May 12, 1962, reveals an ironic sidelight on the story of parity&#39;s downfall. 
In 1928 three physicists at New York University had actually discovered a parity violation in the decay of a radioactive isotope of radium! 
The experiment had been repeated with refined techniques in 1930. 
&ldquo;Not only in every run,&rdquo; the experimenter reported, &ldquo;but even in all readings in every run, with few exceptions,&rdquo; the effect was observable. 
But this was at a time when, as Bernstein puts it, there was no theoretical context in which to place these results. 
They were quickly forgotten, &ldquo;They were,&rdquo; writes Bernstein, &ldquo;a kind of statement made in a void. 
It took almost thirty years of intensive research in all branches of experimental and theoretical physics, and, above all, it took the work of Lee and Yang, to enable physicists to appreciate exactly what those early experiments implied.&rdquo; 


In 1957 Lee and Yang received the Nobel prize in physics for their work. Lee was then 30, Yang 34. 
The choice was inevitable. 
The year 1957 had been the most stirring in modern particle physics, and Lee and Yang had done most of the stirring. 
Today the two men have adjacent offices at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where they continue to collaborate. 
Both live in Princeton with their attractive wives and children, proud of their Chinese heritage, deeply committed to science, and with a wide range of interests outside of physics and mathematics. 
If you are curious to know more about these two remarkable men, look up Bernstein&#39;s excellent New Yorker article. 


It is worth pausing to note that, like so many other revolutions in physics, this one came about as the result of largely abstract, theoretical, mathematical work. 
Not one of the three experiments that first toppled parity would have been performed at the time it was performed if Lee and Yang had not told the experimenters what to do. 
Lee had had no experience whatever in a laboratory. Yang had worked briefly in a lab at the University of Chicago, where he was once a kind of assistant to the great Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. 
He had not been happy in experimental work. 
His associates had even made up a short rhyme about him which Bernstein repeats: 

<blockquote>
Where there&#39;s a bang,  \\
There&#39;s Yang. 
</blockquote>


Laboratory bangs can range all the way from an exploding test tube to the explosion of a hydrogen bomb. 
But the really Big Bangs are the bangs that occur inside the heads of theoretical physicists when they try to put together the pieces handed to them by the experimental physicists. 


John Campbell, Jr., the editor of Analog Science Fiction, once speculated in an editorial that perhaps there was some difference in the intellectual heritage of the Western and Oriental worlds which had predisposed two Chinese physicists to question the symmetry of natural law. 
It is an interesting thought. 
I myself pointed out, in my Mathematical Games column in Scientific American, March 1958, that the great religious symbol of the Orient (it appears on the Korean national flag) is the circle divided asymmetrically as shown in Figure 63. 
The dark 

<figure>
\label{fig:63}
\caption{The asymmetric Yin-Yang symbol of the Orient.}
</figure>

and light areas are known respectively as the Yin and Yang. 
The Yin and Yang are symbols of all the fundamental dualities of life: good and evil, beauty and ugliness, truth and falsehood, male and female, night and day, sun and moon, heaven and earth, pleasure and pain, odd and even, left and right, positive and negative &hellip; the list is endless. 
This dualism was first symbolized in China by the odd and even digits that alternate around the perimeter of the Lo shu, the ancient Chinese magic square of order 3. 
Sometime in the tenth century the Lo shu was replaced by the divided circle, which soon became the dominant Yin-Yang symbol. 
When it was printed or drawn, black and white was used, but when painted, the Yang was made red instead of white. 
The two small spots were (and still are) usually added to symbolize the fact that on each side of any duality there is always a bit of the other side. 
Every good act contains an element of evil, every evil act an element of good; every ugliness includes some beauty, every beauty includes some ugliness, and so on.\cite{}
The spots remind the scientist that every &ldquo;true&rdquo; theory contains an element of falsehood. 
&ldquo;Nothing is perfect,&rdquo; says the Philosopher in James Stephens&#39; The Crock of Gold. &ldquo;There are lumps in it.&rdquo; 


<span class="textsc">Exercise 17</span>:
\emph{There is a three-dimensional analog of the Yin-Yang, so familiar that almost everyone has at one time held a model of it in his hands. 
What is it? Is it left-right symmetrical?}


The history of science can be described as a continual, perhaps never-ending, discovery of new lumps. 
It was once thought that planets moved in perfect circles. 
Even Galileo, although he placed the sun and not the earth at the center of the solar system, could not accept Kepler&#39;s view that the planetary orbits were ellipses. 
Eventually it became clear that Kepler had been right: the orbits are almost circles but not quite. 
Newton&#39;s theory of gravity explained why the orbits were perfect ellipses. 
Then slight deviations in the Newtonian orbits turned up and were in turn explained by the correction factors of relativity theory that Einstein introduced into the Newtonian equations. 
&ldquo;The real trouble with this world of ours,&rdquo; comments Gilbert Chesterton in Orthodoxy, &ldquo;is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. 
The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite. 
&hellip; It looks just a little more mathematical and regular than it is; its exactitude is obvious, but its inexactitude is hidden; its wildness lies in wait.&rdquo; 


To illustrate, Chesterton imagines an extraterrestrial examining a human body for the first time. 
He notes that the right side exactly duplicates the left: two arms, two legs, two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, even two lobes of the brain. 
Probing deeper he finds a heart on the left side. He deduces that there is another heart on the right. 
Here of course, he encounters a spot of Yin within the Yang. 
&ldquo;It is this silent swerving from accuracy by an inch,&rdquo; Chesterton continues, &ldquo;that is the uncanny element in everything. 
It seems a sort of secret treason in the universe&hellip; . 
Everywhere in things there is this element of the quiet and incalculable.&rdquo; 


Feynman, with no less reverence than Chesterton, says the same thing this way at the close of a lecture on symmetry in physical laws (Lecture 52 in The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley, 1963): &ldquo;Why is nature so nearly symmetrical?
No one has any idea why. 
The only thing we might suggest is something like this: There is a gate in Japan, a gate in Neiko, which is sometimes called by the Japanese the most beautiful gate in all Japan; it was built in a time when there was great influence from Chinese art. 
This gate is very elaborate, with lots of gables and beautiful carving and lots of columns and dragon heads and princes carved into the pillars, and so on. 
But when one looks closely he sees that in the elaborate and complex design along one of the pillars, one of the small design elements is carved upside down; otherwise the thing is completely symmetrical. 
If one asks why this is, the story is that it was carved upside down so that the gods will not be jealous of the perfection of man. 
So they purposely put the error in there, so that the gods would not be jealous and get angry with human beings. 


&ldquo;We might like to turn the idea around and think that the true explanation of the near symmetry of nature is this: that God made the laws only nearly symmetrical so that we should not be jealous of His perfection!&rdquo; 


Note that the Yin-Yang symbol is asymmetrical. 
It is not superposable on its mirror image. The Yin and Yang are congruent shapes, each asymmetrical, each with the same handedness. 
By contrast the Christian symbol, the cross, is left-right symmetrical. So is the Jewish six-pointed Star of David, unless it is shown as an interlocking pair of triangles that cross alternately over and under each other. 
It is a pleasant thought that perhaps the familiar asymmetry of the oriental symbol, so much a part of Chinese culture, may have played a subtle, unconscious role in making it a bit easier for Lee and Yang to go against the grain of scientific orthodoxy; to propose a test which their more symmetric-minded Western colleagues had thought scarcely worth the effort. 


NOTES 

1. For the benefit of readers interested in recreational mathematics, I cannot resist adding that Feynman is one of the codiscoverers of hexaflexagons, those remarkable paper-folded structures that keep changing their faces when flexed. 
(See Chapter 1 of my Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions.) 
Although a hexaflexagon looks perfectly symmetrical, its inner structure possesses a handedness; that is, any given flexagon can be constructed in either a left or right-handed way. 


In 1949 Feynman had suggested that perhaps the positron is an electron moving temporarily backward in time (&ldquo;The Theory of Positrons,&rdquo; <em>Physical Review</em>, Vol. 76, 1949, pp. 749-759; reprinted in Quantum Electrodynamics, edited by Julius Schwinger, Dover, 1958). 
This prompted speculations that antiparticles are simply particles moving backward in time, and that time might be reversed (relative to our time) in galaxies of antimatter. 
(See &ldquo;The Tiniest Time Traveler&rdquo; by David Fox, <em>Astounding Science Fiction</em>, December 1952; &ldquo;Speculations Concerning Precognition&rdquo; by 1. J. Good in his anthology of &ldquo;partly baked ideas,&rdquo; <em>The Scientist Speculates</em>, Basic, 1962, pp. 151ff.) 


It is true that if a motion picture of a spinning top is run backward, the picture will be the same as if mirror reversed, but there are strong technical reasons why time reversal cannot be invoked as an explanation of parity violation in weak interactions. 
Hans Reichenbach, in his book The Direction of Time (University of California Press, 1956, pp. 262&endash;269), calls Feynman&#39;s positron theory &ldquo;the most serious blow the concept of time has ever received in physics.&rdquo; 
Not only does it reverse the direction of time for parts of the world, Reichenbach points out, it also destroys the uniform topological order of causal chains. 
Admirers of Lewis Carroll need not be reminded of the Outlandish Watch (<em>Sylvie and Bruno</em>, Chapter 23) with its &ldquo;reversal-peg&rdquo; that causes time to flow backward. 


2. For these facts about the Yin-Yang symbol I am indebted to Schuyler Cammann&#39;s excellent article on &ldquo;The Magic Square of Three in Old Chinese Philosophy and Religion,&rdquo; <em>History of Religions</em>, Vol. 1, No. 1, Summer 1961, pp. 37-80.
