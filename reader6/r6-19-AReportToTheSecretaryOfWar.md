## Preamble
\label{sec:I}

The only reason to treat nuclear power differently from all the other developments in the field of physics is the possibility of its use as a means of poetical pressure in peace and sudden destruction in war. 
All present plans for the organization of research, scientific and industrial development, and publication in the field of nucleonics are conditioned by the political and military climate in which one expects those plans to be carried out. 
Therefore, in making suggestions for the postwar organization of nucleonics, a discussion of political problems cannot be avoided. 
The scientists on this project do not presume to speak authoritatively on problems of national and international policy. 
However, we found ourselves, by the force of events during the last five years, in the position of a small group of citizens cognizant of a grave danger for the safety of this country as well as for the future of all the other nations, of which the rest of mankind is unaware. 
We therefore feel it our duty to urge that the political problems arising from the mastering of nuclear power be recognized in all their gravity, and that appropriate steps be taken for their study and the preparation of necessary decisions. 
We hope that the creation of the committee by the Secretary of War to deal with all aspects of nucleonics indicates that these implications have been recognized by the government. 
We believe that our acquaintance with the scientific elements of the situation and prolonged preoccupation with its worldwide political implications, imposes on us the obligation to offer to the committee some suggestions as to the possible solution of these grave problems. 


Scientists have often before been accused of providing new weapons for the mutual destruction of nations instead of improving their well-being. 
It is undoubtedly true that the discovery of flying, for example, has SD far brought much more misery than enjoyment and profit to humanity. 
However, in the past scientists could disclaim direct responsibility for the use to which mankind had put their disinterested discoveries. 
We feel compelled to take a more active stand now because the success which we have achieved in the development of nuclear power is fraught with infinitely greater dangers than were all the inventions of the past. 
All of us familiar with the present state of nucleonics live with the vision before our eyes of sudden destruction visited on our own country, of a Pearl Harbor disaster repeated in thousand-fold magnification in every one of our major cities. 


In the past, science has often been able to also provide new methods of protection against new weapons of aggression it made possible, but it cannot promise such efficient protection against the destructive use of nuclear power. 
This protection can come only from the poetical organization of the world. 
Among all the arguments calling for an efficient international organization for peace, the existence of nuclear weapons is the most compelling one. 
In the absence of an international authority which would make all resort to force in international conflicts impossible, nations could still be diverted from a path which must lead to total mutual destruction by a specific international agreement barring a nuclear armaments race. 


## Prospects of Armaments Race
\label{sec:II}

It could be suggested that the danger of destruction by nuclear weapons can be avoided&emdash;at least as far as this country is concerned&emdash;either by keeping our discoveries secret for an indefinite time, or else by developing our nuclear armaments at such a pace that no other nation would think of attacking us from fear of overwhelming retaliation. 


The answer to the first suggestion is that although we undoubtedly are at present ahead of the rest of the world in this field, the fundamental facts of nuclear power are a subject of common knowledge. 
British scientists know as much as we do about the basic wartime progress of nucleonics&emdash;if not of the specific processes used in our engineering developments&emdash;and the role which French nuclear physicists have played in the pre-war development of this field, plus their occasional contact with our projects, will enable them to catch up rapidly, at least as far as basic scientific discoveries are concerned. 
German scientists, in whose discoveries the whole development of this field originated, apparently did not develop it during the war to the same extent to which this has been done in America, but to the last day of the European war we were living in constant apprehension as to their possible achievements. 
The certainty that German scientists were working on this weapon and that their government would certainly have no scruples against using it when available was the main motivation of the initiative which American scientists took in urging the development of nuclear power for military purposes on a large scale in this country. 
In Russia, too, the basic facts and implications of nuclear power were well understood in 1940, and the experience of Russian scientists in nuclear research is entirely sufficient to enable them to retrace our steps within a few years, even if we should make every attempt to conceal them. 
Even if we can retain our leadership in basic knowledge of nucleonics for a certain time by maintaining secrecy as to all results achieved on this and associated projects, it would be foolish to hope that this can protect us for more than a few years. 


It may be asked whether we cannot prevent the development of military nucleonics in other countries by a monopoly on the raw materials of nuclear power. 
The answer is that even though the largest now known deposits of uranium ores are under the control of powers which belong to the &ldquo;western&rdquo; group (Canada, Belgium and British India), the old deposits in Czechoslovakia are outside this sphere. 
Russia is known to be mining radium on its own territory, and even if we do not know the size of the deposits discovered so far in the USSR, the probability that no large reserves of uranium will be found in a country which covers one-fifth of the land area of the earth (and whose sphere of influence takes in additional territory), is too small to serve as a basis for security. 
Thus, we cannot hope to avoid a nuclear armament race either by keeping secret from the competing nations the basic scientific facts of nuclear power or by cornering the raw materials required for such a race. 


We now consider the second of the two suggestions made at the beginning of this section, and ask whether we could not feel ourselves safe in a race of nuclear armaments by virtue of our greater industrial potential, including greater diffusion of scientific and technical knowledge, greater volume and efficiency of our skilled labor corps, and greater experience of our management&emdash;all the factors whose importance has been so strikingly demonstrated in the conversion of this country into an arsenal of the allied nations in the present war. 
The answer is that all that these advantages can give us is the accumulation of a larger number of bigger and better atomic bombs. 


However, such a quantitative advantage in reserves of bottled destructive power will not make us safe from sudden attack. 
Just because a potential enemy will be afraid of being &ldquo;outnumbered and outgunned,&rdquo; the temptation for him may be overwhelming to attempt a sudden unprovoked blow&emdash;particularly if he should suspect us of harboring aggressive intentions against his security or his sphere of influence. 
In no other type of warfare does the advantage lie so heavily with the aggressor. 
He can place his &ldquo;infernal machines&rdquo; in advance in all our major cities and explode them simultaneously, thus destroying a major part of our industry and a large part of our population aggregated in densely populated metropolitan districts. 
Our possibilities of retaliation&emdash;even if retaliation should be considered adequate compensation for the loss of millions of lives and destruction of our largest cities&emdash;will be greatly handicapped because we must rely on aerial transportation of the bombs, and also because we may have to deal with an enemy whose industry and population are dispersed over a large territory. 


In fact, if the race for nuclear armaments is allowed to develop, the only apparent way in which our country can be protected from the paralyzing effects of a sudden attack is by dispersal of those industries which are essential for our war efforts and dispersal of the populations of our major metropolitan cities. 
As long as nuclear bombs remain scarce (i.e., as long as uranium remains the only basic material for their fabrication), efficient dispersal of our industry and the scattering of our metropolitan population will considerably decrease the temptation to attack us by nuclear weapons. 


At present, it may be that atomic bombs can be detonated with an effect equal to that of 20,000 tons of TNT. 
One of these bombs could then destroy something like three square miles of an urban area. 
Atomic bombs containing a larger quantity of active material but still weighing less than one ton may be expected to be available within ten years which could destroy over ten square miles of a city. 
A nation able to assign ten tons of atomic explosives for a sneak attack on this country can then hope to achieve the destruction of all industry and most of the population in an area from 500 square miles upwards. 
If no choice of targets, with a total area of 500 square miles of American territory, contains a large enough fraction of the nation&#39;s industry and population to make their destruction a crippling blow to the nation&#39;s war potential and its ability to defend itself, then the attack will not pay and may not be undertaken. 
At present, one could easily select in this country a hundred areas of five square miles each whose simultaneous destruction would be a staggering blow to the nation. 
Since the area of the United States is about three million square miles, it should be possible to scatter its industrial and human resources in such a way as to leave no 500 square miles important enough to serve as a target for nuclear attack. 


We are fully aware of the staggering difficulties involved in such a radical change in the social and economic structure of our nation. 
We felt, however, that the dilemma had to be stated, to show what kind of alternative methods of protection will have to be considered if no successful international agreement is reached. 
It must be pointed out that in this field we are in a less favorable position than nations which are either now more diffusely populated and whose industries are more scattered, or whose governments have unlimited power over the movement of population and the location of industrial plants. 


If no efficient international agreement is achieved, the race for nuclear armaments will be on in earnest not later than the morning after our first demonstration of the existence of nuclear weapons. 
After this, it might take other nations three or four years to overcome our present head start, and eight or ten years to draw even with us if we continue to do intensive work in this field. 
This might be all the time we would have to bring about the relocation of our population and industry. 
Obviously, no time should be lost in inaugurating a study of this problem by experts. 


## Prospects of Agreement
\label{sec:III}

The consequences of nuclear warfare, and the type of measures which would have to be taken to protect a country from total destruction by nuclear bombing must be as abhorrent to other nations as to the United States. 
England, France, and the smaller nations of the European continent, with their congeries of people and industries, would be in a particularly desperate situation in the face of such a threat. 
Russia and China are the only great nations at present which could survive a nuclear attack. 
However, even though these countries may value human life less than the peoples of Western Europe and America, and even though Russia, in particular, has an immense space over which its vital industries could be dispersed and a government which can order this dispersion the day it is convinced that such a measure is necessary&emdash;there is no doubt that Russia, too, will shudder at the possibility of a sudden disintegration of Moscow and Leningrad, almost miraculously preserved in the present war, and of its new industrial cities in the Urals and Siberia. 
Therefore, only lack of mutual trust and not lack of desire for agreement can stand in the path of an efficient agreement for the prevention of nuclear warfare. 
The achievement of such an agreement will thus essentially depend on the integrity of intentions and readiness to sacrifice the necessary fraction of one&#39;s own sovereignty by all the parties to the agreement. 


One possible way to introduce nuclear weapons to one world&emdash;which may particularly appeal to those who consider nuclear bombs primarily as a secret weapon developed to help win the present war&emdash;is to use them without warning on appropriately selected objects in Japan. 


Although important tactical results undoubtedly can be achieved by a sudden introduction of nuclear weapons, we nevertheless think that the question of the use of the very first available atomic bombs in the Japanese war should be weighed very carefully, not only by military authorities but by the highest political leadership of this country. 


Russia, and even allied countries which bear less mistrust of our ways and intentions, as well as neutral countries may be deeply shocked by this step. 
It may be very difficult to persuade the world that a nation which was capable of secretly preparing and suddenly releasing a new weapon as indiscriminate as the rocket bomb and a thousand times more destructive is to be trusted in its proclaimed desire of having such weapons abolished by international agreement. 
We have large accumulations of poison gas but do not use them, and recent polls have shown that public opinion in this country would disapprove of such a use even if it would accelerate the winning of the Far Eastern war. 
It is true that some irrational element in mass psychology makes gas poisoning more revolting than blasting by explosives, even though gas warfare is in no way more &ldquo;inhuman&rdquo; than the war of bombs and bullets. 
Nevertheless, it is not at all certain that American public opinion, if it could be enlightened as to the effect of atomic explosives, would approve of our own country being the first to introduce such an indiscriminate method of wholesale destruction of civilian life. 


Thus, from the &ldquo;optimistic&rdquo; point of view&emdash;looking forward to an international agreement on the prevention of nuclear warfare&emdash;the military advantages and the saving of American lives achieved by the sudden use of atomic bombs against Japan may be outweighed by the ensuing loss of confidence and by a wave of horror and repulsion sweeping over the rest of the world and perhaps even dividing public opinion at home. 


From this point of view, a demonstration of the new weapon might best be made, before the eyes of representatives of all the United Nations, on the desert or a barren island. 
The best possible atmosphere for the achievement of an international agreement could be achieved if America could say to the world, &ldquo;You see what sort of a weapon we had but did not use. 
We are ready to renounce its use in the future if other nations join us in this renunciation and agree to the establishment of an efficient international control.&rdquo; 


After such a demonstration the weapon might perhaps be used against Japan if the sanction of the United Nations (and of public opinion at home) were obtained, perhaps after a preliminary ultimatum to Japan to surrender or at least to evacuate certain regions as an alternative to their total destruction, This may sound fantastic, but in nuclear weapons we have something entirely new in order of magnitude of destructive power, and if we want to capitalize fully on the advantage their possession gives us, we must use new and imaginative methods. 


It must be stressed that if one takes the pessimistic point of view and discounts the possibility of an effective international control over nuclear weapons at the present time, then the advisability of an early use of nuclear bombs against Japan becomes even more doubtful&emdash;quite independent of any humanitarian considerations. 
If an international agreement is not concluded immediately after the first demonstration, this will mean a flying start toward an unlimited armaments race. 
If this race is inevitable, we have every reason to delay its beginning as long as possible in order to increase our head start still further. 


The benefit to the nation and the saving of American lives in the future achieved by renouncing an early demonstration of nuclear bombs and letting the other nations come into the race only reluctantly, on the basis of guesswork and without definite knowledge that the &ldquo;thing does work,&rdquo; may far outweigh the advantages to be gained by the immediate use of the first and comparatively inefficient bombs in the war against Japan. 
On the other hand, it may be argued that without an early demonstration it may prove difficult to obtain adequate support for further intensive development of nucleonics in this country and that thus the time gained by the postponement of an open armaments race will not be properly used. 


Furthermore one may suggest that other nations are now or will soon be not entirely unaware of our present achievements, and that consequently the postponement of a demonstration may serve no useful purpose as far as the avoidance of an armaments race is concerned and may only create additional mistrust, thus worsening rather them improving the chances of an ultimate accord on the international control of nuclear explosives. 


Thus, if the prospects of an agreement will be considered poor in the immediate future, the pros and cons of an early revelation of our possession of nuclear weapons to the world&emdash;not only by their actual use against Japan but also by a prearranged demonstration&emdash;must be carefully weighed by the supreme political and military leadership of the country, and the decision should not be left to the considerations of military tactics alone. 


One may point out that scientists themselves have initiated the development of this &ldquo;secret weapon&rdquo; and it is therefore strange that they should be reluctant to try it out on the enemy as soon as it is available. 
The answer to this question was given above&emdash;the compelling reason for creating this weapon with such speed was our fear that Germany had the technical skill necessary to develop such a weapon, and that the German government had no moral restraints regarding its use. 


Another argument which could be quoted in favor of using atomic bombs as soon as they are available is that so much taxpayers&#39; money has been invested in these projects that the Congress and the American public will demand a return for their money. 
The attitude of American public opinion, mentioned earlier in the matter of the use of poison gas against Japan, shows that one can expect the American public to understand that it is sometimes desirable to keep a weapon in readiness for use only in extreme emergency; and as soon as the potentialities of nuclear weapons are revealed to the American people, one can be sure that they will support all attempts to make the use of such weapons impossible. 


Once this is achieved, the large installations and the accumulation of explosive material at present earmarked for potential military use will become available for important peacetime developments, including power production, large engineering undertakings, and mass production of radioactive materials. 
In this way, the money spent on wartime development of nucleonics may become a boon for the peacetime development of national economy. 

## Methods of International Control
\label{sec:IV}

We now consider the question of how an effective international control of nuclear armaments can be achieved. 
This is a difficult problem, but we think it soluble. 
It requires study by statesmen and international lawyers, and we can offer only some preliminary suggestions for such a study. 


Given mutual trust and willingness on all sides to give up a certain part of their sovereign rights by admitting international control of certain phases of national economy, the control could be exercised (alternatively or simultaneously) on two different levels. 


The first and perhaps simplest way is to ration the raw materials&emdash;primarily the uranium ores. 
Production of nuclear explosives begins with the processing of large quantities of uranium in large isotope separation plants or huge production piles. 
The amounts of ore taken out of the ground at different locations could be controlled by resident agents of the international control board, and each nation could be allotted only an amount which would make large scale separation of fissionable isotopes impossible. 


Such a limitation would have the drawback of making impossible also the development of nuclear power for peacetime purposes. 
However, it need not prevent the production of radioactive elements on a scale sufficient to revolutionize the industrial, scientific, and technical use of these materials, and would thus not eliminate the main benefits which nucleonics promises to bring to mankind. 


An agreement on a higher level, involving more mutual trust and understanding, would be to allow unlimited production but keep exact bookkeeping on the fate of each pound of uranium mined. 
If in this way, check is kept on the conversion of uranium and thorium ore into pure fissionable materials, the question arises as to how to prevent accumulation of large quantities of such materials in the hands of one or several nations. 
Accumulations of this kind could be rapidly converted into atomic bombs if a nation should break away from international control. 
It has been suggested that a compulsory denaturation of pure fissionable isotopes may be agreed upon — by diluting them after production with suitable isotopes to make them useless for military purposes, while retaining their usefulness for power engines. 


One thing is clear: any international agreement on prevention of nuclear armaments must be backed by actual and efficient controls. 
No paper agreement can be sufficient since neither this or any other nation can stake its whole existence on trust in other nations&#39; signatures. 
Every attempt to impede the international control agencies would have to be considered equivalent to denunciation of the agreement. 


It hardly needs stressing that we as scientists believe that any systems of control envisaged should leave as much freedom for the peacetime development of nucleonics as is consistent with the safety of the world. 

## Summary
\label{sec:V}

The development of nuclear power not only constitutes an important addition to the technological and military power of the United States, but also creates grave political and economic problems for the future of this country. 


Nuclear bombs cannot possibly remain a &ldquo;secret weapon&rdquo; at the exclusive disposal of this country for more than a few years. 
The scientific facts on which their construction is based are well known to scientists of other countries. Unless an effective international control of nuclear explosives is instituted, a race for nuclear armaments is certain to ensue following the first revelation of our possession of nuclear weapons to the world. 
Within ten years other countries may have nuclear bombs, each of which, weighing less than a ton, could destroy an urban area of more than ten square miles. 
In the war to which such an armaments race is likely to lead, the United States, with its agglomeration of population and industry in comparatively few metropolitan districts, will be at a disadvantage compared to nations whose population and industry are scattered over large areas. 


We believe that these considerations make the use of nuclear bombs for an early unannounced attack against Japan inadvisable. 
If the United States were to be the first to release this new means of indiscriminate destruction upon mankind, she would sacrifice public support throughout the world, precipitate the race for armaments, and prejudice the possibility of reaching an international agreement on the future control of such weapons. 


Much more favorable conditions for the eventual achievement of such an agreement could be created if nuclear bombs were first revealed to the world by a demonstration in an appropriately selected uninhabited area. 


In case chances for the establishment of an effective international control of nuclear weapons should have to be considered slight at the present time, then not only the use of these weapons against Japan but even their early demonstration may be contrary to the interests of this country. 
A postponement of such a demonstration will have in this case the advantage of delaying the beginning of the nuclear armaments race as long as possible. 


If the government should decide in favor of an early demonstration of nuclear weapons, it will then have the possibility of taking into account the public opinion of this country and of the other nations before deciding whether these weapons should be used against Japan. 
In this way, other nations may assume a share of responsibility for such a fateful decision.
