## Introduction

If war is eliminated as a way of resolving conflicts, whether through the Establishment of a world government&emdash;limited or otherwise&emdash;or by some other means, the world of the future will still be confronted by a multiplicity of problems. 
Even without the threat of war, some of the next most serious problems which confront mankind would by no means be solved completely, although many would be eased. 
A number of these problems by their nature have traditionally depended upon the existence of warfare for their solution. 
Although the revision of boundaries, the redistribution of ethnic groups and the allocation of natural resources have often been settled peacefully, in most cases the very existence of military power has played a predominant role in determining specific solutions. 


Clearly, if war is to be eliminated, it is important that we find substitutes for warfare in the solution of the problems which arise between nations and groups of nations. 
It is important therefore that we attempt to form some conception of what those problems are likely to be. Sketched in broad strokes, what might the technological-demographic-economic environment of the world be like in the decades ahead? 


## Industrial Civilization


Most of the difficulties confronting us today stem from the fact that we are living in the middle of an enormous revolution, which is characterized primarily by rapid technological change. 
Never before in history has society changed as rapidly as it is changing today. 
The closest parallel to our modem situation occurred about \num{7 000} years ago, when our primitive food-gathering ancestors learned that they could cultivate edible plants and domesticate animals. 
With the emergence of these new techniques, more than \num{500} persons could be supported in areas where previously only one could be supported. 


Before the invention of agriculture, human populations had spread throughout the temperate and tropical regions. 
The world, though sparsely populated by our standards, was saturated with human beings within the framework of the technology then in existence. 
With the techniques available, the whole earth could not have supported more than about ten million persons. 
Following the onset of the agricultural revolution, human populations increased rapidly. 


Long before the agricultural revolution came to an end, another phase of human existence began with the industrial revolution. 


From its early beginnings, industrial civilization emerged in Western Europe, then spread to North America and later to Russia and Japan. 
Today it is transforming China and India. 
Barring a catastrophe, it seems inevitable that machine culture, like agriculture, is destined one day to become world-wide. 


One of the results of the industrial revolution was an acceleration in the spread of agriculture throughout the world. 
A second result was a dramatic upsurge in the rate of population growth, brought about by rapidly decreasing mortality rates. 
Scientific methods of agriculture made possible higher crop yields. 
Efficient and rapid transportation systems virtually eliminated large-scale famine. 
Sanitation techniques, immunization, and other medical innovations reduced premature deaths among the young. 
The numbers of human beings jumped from about \num{500} million in 1650 to \num{2 800} million in 1960. 


Today we are closer to the beginning of the industrial revolution than we are to its end. 
At one end of the economic scale are the people of the United States, representing only 6 percent of the world&#39;s population but consuming about 50 percent of the goods produced in the world. 
At the opposite end of the scale we find the vast populations which dwell in the greater part of Asia, in parts of Africa, in all of Central America, and in parts of South America. 
Fully 50 percent of the world&#39;s population live under conditions of extreme poverty, with food supplies far less than the minimum required for a healthy existence, and with misery and privation the rule rather than the exception. 


## Americas Next Fifty Years

Many of the problems which confront the world at present involve the difficult nature of the transition from a culture which is primarily agrarian to one which is primarily m-ban-industrial. 
The United States has traveled down the road of industrialization further than any nation. 
A projection of the basic changes taking place within our own society can provide important indications concerning the future of a highly industrialized world. 


During the next fifty years it is likely that the population of the continental United States will more than double, giving us about 400 million persons. 
Because there is little reason to believe that our population density will stop much short of the current level in Western Europe, one may expect eventually a population of about \num{1 000} million persons. 
The new additions will be primarily city and town oriented. 
Cities will spread over vast areas. 
Fifty years from now an additional area the size of the state of West Virginia will be urbanized. 
On the Pacific Coast alone, new city expansion may take place, totaling fifteen times the present area of the city of Los Angeles. 


As the process of urbanization continues and as our society becomes increasingly complex, the requirements for transportation and communication facilities will probably increase rapidly. 
It seems likely that during the next fifty years the total ton-mileage of freight which must be shipped to support the population will more than triple. 
Inter-city passenger traffic may increase ten-fold, while the numbers of telephone conversations and pieces of mail may increase seven-fold. 


The processes of mechanization and automation are resulting in rapidly increasing rates of both agricultural and industrial production per man-hour worked. 
We might expect during the next fifty years a three- to ten-fold increase in agricultural productivity, and perhaps a two- to four-fold increase in industrial productivity. 


As in the past, these greater levels of productivity will be achieved in part by our consuming vastly greater quantities of raw materials and by our feeding greatly increased quantities of energy into the industrial network. 
During the next fifty years it is not unreasonable to suppose that the production of basic materials such as steel will increase about five-fold and that electrical power production will increase another ten-fold. 
Our total energy demands will probably increase four-fold, corresponding to a doubling of energy consumption per person. 
Even on a per capita basis, our raw-material demands are destined to increase considerably in the decades ahead. 
When we couple this with the expected population growth, it is clear that our raw-material demands fifty years from now will dwarf those of today. 


Enormous quantities of materials are required to support an individual in the United States. 
We produce each year, for each person, about \num{1 300} pounds of steel, \num{23} pounds of copper and \num{16} pounds of lead, in addition to considerable quantities of other metals. 
Our demands for nonmetals are even more impressive. 
These quantities will almost certainly increase considerably in the decades ahead. 


In addition to the materials consumed, the quantities of materials which must be in existence in order to support an individual have increased steadily. 
For every person in the United States there are probably in existence, together with other metals, about \num{9} tons of steel, over \num{300} pounds of copper, about \num{100} pounds of lead, and about \num{200} pounds of zinc.  
It seems clear that these quantities of materials in use will continue to rise. 
One can expect that by the turn of the century the figure for steel will increase to about \num{15} tons. 
In the first place, the quantities of things which people are willing to buy has not as yet reached the saturation level. 
Second, we must work ever harder in order to obtain the raw materials we need. 
Having used up the easily accessible ore deposits, we require a great deal more technology, more equipment, more steel, and greater energy expenditure to produce a pound of metal today than was required in 1900. 


It seems plausible that by the turn of the century steel production in the United States will exceed 400 million tons annually. 
Increasing demands for metals will bring about increasing demands for metallic ores. 
As demands increase and as the grades of domestic ores decrease, it will become more difficult for us to find supplies of raw materials to keep our industrial network functioning. 
Increasing quantities of these materials such as iron ore, bauxite, copper ore, and petroleum must come from abroad. 
By 1980, the United States may well be one of the poorest nations in the world with respect to high-grade raw materials. 
For the United States, therefore, the next fifty years will be characterized by a growing dependence of the United States upon the natural resources of other major areas of the world. 
Of course, as industrialization spreads to other areas, competition for the earth&#39;s resources will increase dramatically. 


Eventually high-grade resources are destined to disappear from the earth. 
Decreasing grades of ores will be compensated for by increasing energy consumption. 
When that time arrives, industrial civilization will feed upon the leanest of raw materials&emdash;sea water, air, ordinary rock, sedimentary deposits such as limestones and phosphate rock, and sunlight. 


As grades of ore diminish, industries will become more complex and highly integrated. 
It seems likely that we will eventually reach the point where we shall have vast assemblages of plants, particularly in coastal regions, where rock is quarried, uranium and other metals are isolated, nitric acid is manufactured, atomic power is generated, hydrogen is produced, iron ores are reduced to pig iron, aluminum and magnesium metals are prepared, and vast quantities of liquid fuels and organic chemicals are manufactured. 
The single-purpose plant is likely to diminish in importance, and eventually to disappear. 
When this time is reached, most of the major industrial areas of the world will find it easier to gain their sustenance by applying science and technology to the task of processing domestic, low-grade substances than to look abroad. 
But before that time is reached, we will pass through a period of increasing dependence upon imports. 
As population increases, as new cities emerge and old ones merge, there will be increased crowding and a multiplication of the problems which have long been characteristic of highly urbanized areas. 
The basic domestic problems in the United States will be those of a densely populated industrial nation in which the metropolitan area is the basic unit. 
Regional differences in population patterns will disappear. 


Properly planned and financed, the new urban areas could be pleasant places in which to live. 
Unplanned, and in the absence of adequate public funds for public facilities and services, a vast nationwide slum could emerge in a relatively short time. 
Indeed our political-social-economic situation a few decades from now will depend in large part upon our attitudes toward the expenditure of public funds, toward long-range planning, and toward the powers of the various levels of local, state, and federal government. 


The increasing technological and sociological complexity of our society will result in the need for higher levels of education. 
At the turn of the century, more than one out of every three workers were unskilled. 
By 1950 only one in five workers remained unskilled. 
By contrast, our need for professional workers has increased five-fold in the last half century. 
Even more important, our need for professional workers is still increasing rapidly and seems destined to increase at least another five-fold in the next fifty years. 
Scientists and engineers alone have increased ten-fold in number in the last half century. 


The process of automation will result in a considerable dislocation of labor in certain industries and in certain localities. 
The higher productivity which will result, reaching perhaps four times that of the present level within 50 years, will give rise to several major problems. 
Will this result in higher total production or in more leisure? 


If the end result is higher production, to whom will the goods be sold? 
Can they be absorbed domestically or will they be sold abroad? 
If the end result is more leisure, how will the hours of work and the wages be divided? And how will people spend their leisure time? 
The answers to these questions will depend in part upon the decisions which are made in the next decade concerning many aspects of foreign policy as well as domestic policy. 


## The Upsurge of Population

The population of the world is increasing rapidly. 
Even more important, however, is the fact that the rate of population growth is increasing rapidly as well. 
Between 1850 and 1900 the world population grew at a rate of about \num{0.7} percent per year. 
During the following half century, the average annual rate of increase was \num{0.9} percent per year. 
Between 1950 and 1956 the annual rate of increase averaged \num{1.6} percent. 
This remarkable increase in the rate of population growth has resulted primarily from rapidly lowered death rates. 


We do not have to look far to find the reasons for the rapid decline in mortality in the underdeveloped areas. 
It is now possible to treat many of the diseases which are widespread in these areas on a mass basis, and control can be achieved at low cost. 
Insecticides such as DDT, vaccines such as BCG, and antibiotics such as penicillin are some of the developments which have made control possible on a mass basis. 
For example, widespread spraying of the island of Ceylon with DDT resulted in a decrease of mortality by \num{34} percent in one year alone. 
As a result of the spread of such techniques, the population of Costa Rica is growing at a rate of \num{3.7} percent per year. 
The rates in many other areas are nearly as large: Mexico, \num{2.9} percent; Ceylon, \num{2.8} percent; Puerto Rico, \num{2.8} percent&emdash;all compared with a world average of about \num{1.6} percent. 


As industrialization spreads to other areas of the world and as techniques of birth control are adopted by various cultures, it is possible that birth rates will fall. 
If we assume, for example, that the rate of population growth in the West will fall to very low levels by 1975 ( which may be true in Western Europe but which almost certainly will not be true in North America), that rates of growth in Japan, Eastern Europe, and Oceania will fall to low levels by the turn of the next century, that Africa, South Central Asia, most of Latin America and China will pass through the industrial transition in 75 years, and that a full century will be required for most of the Near East, then we arrive at a world population of close to 7 billion before stabilization is approached. 
No matter how optimistic we are, however, it is difficult to visualize a set of circumstances not involving widespread catastrophe, which can result in the leveling off of world population at much less than this figure. 
The earth may eventually be called upon to provide for a substantially higher population than this. 


The demographic changes which are taking place in the world, particularly in those regions which are still predominantly agrarian, are resulting primarily from the application of techniques which are relatively inexpensive, require little capital, and which can be spread without educating large numbers of persons. 
The task of controlling epidemic and endemic diseases is a relatively easy one, compared with the task of increasing food production, improving housing, or enlarging the over-all per capita availability of consumer goods. 
The latter necessitates a level of industrialization far above that which currently exists in these areas. 

## Rates of Development

In three-quarters of the world, persons are now living at extremely low levels of consumption. 
We can easily appreciate the magnitude of the task that is involved in the industrial development of these areas when we examine the huge quantities of materials which would be required. 
If all persons in the world were suddenly brought up to the level of living now enjoyed by the people of the United States, we would have to extract from the earth about \num{18} billion tons of iron, \num{300} million tons of copper, an equal amount of lead and over \num{200} million tons of zinc. 
These totals are well over \num{100} times the world&#39;s present annual rate of production. 
In order to power this newly industrialized society, energy would have to be produced at a rate equivalent to the burning of about \num{16} billion tons of coal per year&emdash;a rate roughly \num{10} times larger than the present one. 


Such a transformation obviously will take time. 
It is important, then, that we inquire into the rates at which industrial growth might take place in the future. 
It is convenient to use as a measure the growth of the iron and steel industry, which is the backbone of modem industrial civilization. 
Annual steel production, which ranges from \num{9} pounds per person in India to about \num{1 300} pounds per person in the United States, provides one of the best indicators of the industrial development of a country. 


In the past such growth has characteristically followed the law of compound interest, and we can thus speak in terms of a &ldquo;doubling time&rdquo;&emdash;the time required to double production capacity. 
In the early stages of expansion of the steel industry in the United States, in Japan, and in the Soviet Union, doubling times varied from five to eight years. 
The more rapid rate appears to be characteristic of what is now possible with proper application of modern technology. 
Indeed, it appears that since 1953 China has expanded her steel industry with a doubling time of less than five years. 


Food production, which is linked with the production of steel, can be increased in two ways: by increasing the amount of food produced per acre and by increasing the numbers of acres cultivated.  
Additional increases in the amounts of food available to human beings can be obtained by decreasing the quantities of plant materials fed to domestic animals. 


The amount of food produced on a given area of land depends, of course, upon the soil and upon climatic conditions. 
In addition, it depends upon the extent to which technology is applied to the problem of producing more food. 
When we look about the world we see that there are large variations in the amounts of food produced per cultivated acre. 
Food with an energy content of about \num{13 000} calories is produced on an average acre in Japan each day. 
The corresponding yield in Western Europe is \num{7 500} calories. 
The yield in India is about \num{2 500} calories. 
These differences do not result primarily from differences of soil fertility or of climatic conditions. 
Rather, they are reflections of the extent to which modem agricultural knowledge is applied specifically to the attainment of high yields. 


By the proper application of technology, the agricultural areas of the world can probably be increased from the present \num{2 400} million acres to about \num{3 500} million acres. 
However, very little of this potential cropland is in Asia. 
Cultivated land area in Asia can probably not be increased by more than 25 percent. 


By far the greatest potential for increased food production is in those areas where reclaimed sea water can eventually be used. 
Today, reclaimed sea water is too expensive to be practicable, but, as the pressures upon the land increase and as our technology improves, we will reach the time when fresh water from the sea will be used to irrigate large areas of the world. 


But there is reason to expect their development to take a long time. 
In selected basic industries production can be doubled every few years because the construction of factories does not necessitate the concerted action of entire populations. 
A steel plant or a fertilizer factory can be built by relatively few persons. 
By contrast, the time scale for changes which involve large segments of a population has in the past been relatively long. 
The spread of modem agricultural techniques has been slow, in part because so many persons must be educated. Even with the application of tremendous effort, it has not been possible in the past to achieve a sustained increase of agricultural production of more than about 4 percent per year. 

## The Challenge

Next to the abolition of war, the industrialization of the underdeveloped areas of the world is perhaps the most formidable task confronting mankind today. 
Indeed, these two problems cannot be divorced from each other. 
Implicit in any discussion of the abolition of war is the assumption that steps will be taken to ensure that deprivation is eliminated in these areas. 


A large fraction of the world&#39;s population is now starving, but there appear to be no technological barriers to the feeding of a stable world population several times the present size. 
Although the world population is increasing rapidly, population growth can in principle be stopped. 
Our high-grade resources are disappearing, but, given an adequate energy supply, we can live comfortably on low-grade resources. 
Nuclear and other sources of energy appear to be adequate for millions of years. 
Indeed, it is amply clear that man can, if he wills it, create a world in which human beings can live comfortably and in peace with one another. 


A major obstacle for most countries is accumulation of sufficient capital to permit industrialization to progress at a pace commensurate with the needs. 
In many areas agricultural products are now being traded with industrialized countries. 
In some areas non-agricultural resources can be traded. 
If the funds received are expended wisely on projects of industrial development, solid foundations for further industrialization can be created. 
But many regions are not blessed with adequate resources either to feed themselves or to provide for their own internal industrial development, let alone their capacity to accumulate capital. 


Without major help from the outside, it is unlikely that the underdeveloped nations can industrialize sufficiently rapidly to eliminate deprivation. 
Here lies perhaps the most basic challenge for a world which hopes to develop into an era beyond war. 
To what extent can the presently industrialized nations of the world jointly attack this problem on a massive scale? 


There is an ample production capacity in the Western world to permit rapid world-wide development, were that capacity used wisely. 
The effort which now goes into the production of the tools of war would greatly accelerate rates of industrialization, were it transferred to the production of the tools of peace. 
Great increases in production capacity can be forthcoming as the result of automation, and, associated with it, increased productivity and decreased capital investment per unit of output. 
Moreover, one of the major problems faced by the democratic-capitalistic-industrialized nations is that of stabilizing the industrial sectors of their economies; a cooperative effort aimed at world-wide industrialization may act as a strong stabilizing force. 


If concerted efforts aimed at world-wide industrial development are not made, it seems likely that totalitarianism will spread rapidly. 
China is already highly regimented and millions of Asians are impressed by her economic progress. 
We should not be surprised were India to attempt at some future time to emulate China. 
The pressures of eking out an existence may soon force Japan to return to the totalitarian fold. 
Furthermore, with modern techniques of control and persuasion, this process may become irreversible. 


We know this to be a fact: it is not the lack of technical knowledge or of knowledge of the earth&#39;s resources that are the major barriers to the evolution of a world in which all individuals have the opportunity of leading free and abundant lives. 
The primary hindrance is man&#39;s apparent inability to devise those social and political institutions which can enable us to apply our technical knowledge at the rapid pace the situation demands. 
Here, no doubt, lies the greatest challenge of a future without war.
