I should like to say a few things on the relation of mathematics and physics which are a little more general. 
Mathematicians are only dealing with the structure of reasoning, and they do not really care what they are talking about. 
They do not even need to know what they are talking about, or, as they themselves say, whether what they say is true. 
I will explain that. 
You state the axioms, such-and-such is so, and such-and-such is so. 
What then? 
The logic can be carried out without knowing what the such-and-such words mean. 
If the statements about the axioms are carefully formulated and complete enough, it is not necessary for the man who is doing the reasoning to have any knowledge of the meaning of the words in order to deduce new conclusions in the same language. 
If I use the word triangle in one of the axioms there will be a statement about triangles in the conclusion, whereas the man who is doing the reasoning may not know what a triangle is. 
But I can read his reasoning back and say, &ldquo;Triangle, that is just a three-sided whathave-you, which is so-and-so&rsquo;, and then I know his new facts. 
In other words, mathematicians prepare abstract reasoning ready to be used if you have a set of axioms about the real world. 
But the physicist has meaning to all his phrases. 
That is a very important thing that a lot of people who come to physics by way of mathematics do not appreciate. 
Physics is not mathematics, and mathematics is not physics. 
One helps the other. 
But in physics you have to have an understanding of the connection of words with the real world. 
It is necessary at the end to translate what you have figured out into EngHsh, into the world, into the blocks of copper and glass that you are going to do the experiments with. 
Only in that way can you find out whether the consequences are true. 
This is a problem which is not a problem of mathe matics at all.

Of course it is obvious that the mathematical reasonings which have been developed are of great power and use for physicists. 
On the other hand, sometimes the physicists' reasoning is useful for mathematicians. 

Mathematicians like to make their reasoning as general as possible. 
If I say to them, &ldquo;I want to talk about ordinary three dimensional space&rdquo;,
    they say &ldquo;If you have a space of _n_ dimensions, then here are the theorems&rdquo;. 
&ldquo;But I only want the case 3&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;Well, substitute _n_=3.&rdquo;!
So it turns out that many of the complicated theorems they have are much simpler when adapted to a special case. 
The physicist is always interested in the special case; he is never interested in the general case. 
He is talking about something; he is not talking abstractly about anything. 
He wants to discuss the gravity law in three dimensions; he never wants the arbitrary force case in _n_ dimensions. So a certain amount of reducing is necessaiy, because the mathematicians have prepared these things for a wide range of problems. This is very useful, and later on it always turns out that the poor physicist has to come back and say,
    &ldquo;Excuse me, when you wanted to tell me about four dimensions&hellip;&rdquo; 

When you know what it is you are talking about, that some symbols represent forces, others masses, inertia, and so on, then you can use a lot of commonsense, seat-of-thepants feeling about the world. 
You have seen various things, and you know more or less how the phenomenon is going to behave. 
But the poor mathematician translates it into equations, and as the symbols do not mean anything to him he has no guide but precise mathematical rigour and care in the argument. 
The physicist, who knows more or less how the answer is going to come out, can sort of guess part way, and so go along rather rapidly. 
The mathematical rigour of great precision is not very useful in physics. 
But one should not criticize the mathematicians on this score. 
It is not necessary that just because something would be useful to physics they have to do it that way. 
They are doing their own job. 
If you want something else, then you work it out for yourself.
