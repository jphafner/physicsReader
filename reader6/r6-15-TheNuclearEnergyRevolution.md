Twenty-four years have passed since Fermi and his co-workers at Chicago achieved the first nuclear chain reaction. 
During most of these years nuclear power for civilian use has been too expensive and experimental in nature to play much of a role in our economy, but during the past couple of years the situation has changed. 
Nuclear reactors now appear to be the cheapest of all sources of energy. 
We believe, and this belief is shared by many others working in nuclear energy, that we are only at the beginning, and that nuclear energy will become cheap enough to influence drastically the many industrial processes that use energy. 
If nuclear energy does not, as H. G. Wells put it in 1914, create &ldquo;A World Set Free,&rdquo; it will nevertheless affect much of the economy of the coming generation. It is this 
Nuclear Energy Revolution, based upon the permanent and ubiquitous availability 
of cheap nuclear power, about which we shall speculate. 


Our outlook is admittedly optimistic; yet optimism in nuclear energy seems justified. 
In 1955, at the first International Conference for the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, in Geneva, some American authorities were chided for predicting nuclear power priced at 4-5 mills per kilowatt hour (kwh).
Today T VA has announced that it expects to generate power from its 2200-megawatt (Mw) Browns Ferry boiling- 
water nuclear plant at 2.4 mills/kwh. Even if the Browns Ferry plant were operated 
by a private utility, the electricity at the bus bar would cost less than 3.5 mills/kwh. 
We are very hopeful that still lower costs will be achieved in the future with 
breeder reactors. 

<em>Cheap Nuclear Energy Is Close at Hand</em>.&emdash;The economic breakthrough in nuclear energy came in 1963 when the Jersey Central Power and Light Company contracted with the General Electric Company to construct the Oyster Creek boiling-water nuclear power plant. 
At its expected electrical output of 620-Mw the capital cost of this plant is $110/kw or the same as that for a coal-fired power plant of the same size at the same location.
The announcement of Oyster Creek was at first regarded by many as a sort of fluke. 
But Oyster Creek was followed by a succession of orders for large light-water-cooled power plants, so that now there are 29 commitments for construction of large nuclear power reactors in the United States (Table 1), More than half of the large station generating capacity ordered in recent months is scheduled to be nuclear.

None of the plants listed in Table 1 are as yet operating. 
Oyster Creek will go on the line early in 1968. 
The optimism expressed in the many purchases of light-water-moderated and cooled reactors is based partly upon our generally good experience with such reactors in the nuclear navy, and partly upon the operating experience with such power plants as the Yankee pressurized-water reactor (175 MW) and the Dresden 1 boiling-water reactor (200 MW). 
Yankee, for example, has been generating electricity for five years, and during the past year has been available for generation 76 per cent of the time. 
Dresden 1 has operated for six years, and during the past year has been available 83 per cent of the time. 


In some ways it is surprising that the world&#39;s cheapest nuclear reactors should derive from the original pressurized-water line used to power the Nautilus. 
Pressurized water was chosen for the Nautilus not because it seemed to be a path to cheap nuclear energy, but rather because such reactors, being moderated by hydrogen and fueled with enriched uranium, are relatively compact. 
If anything, the early reactor designers viewed these systems as being rather expensive. 
And in countries other than the United States and the Soviet Union, the main-line reactors utilize natural uranium and either graphite or heavy water as moderator. 


But the early designers failed to appreciate the extent to which the extraordinary success of the gaseous diffusion plants would reduce the price of U^^*.
In 1948, when the <em>Nautilus</em> was designed, U<sup>235</sup> cost about $35 per gram.
Today it costs \$12 per gram, which is only four times its price as unseparated isotope in ore costing $8 per pound of U<sup>eO8??</sup>!
This remarkable reduction in the cost of separating U<sup>235</sup> more than any other single factor, underlies the economic success of the American water-moderated reactors. 


The fuel cycle in a reactor like Browns Ferry that bums enriched uranium costs only 1.25 mills/(kWh), which is appreciably lower than coal even in cheap coal country (Table 2). 


The American reactors, being compact, were expected to be cheaper to build than the large graphite or heavy-water reactors that use natural uranium. 
But prior to Oyster Creek it was not clear how cheap a reactor could be, especially if its output were large enough. 
It was R. P. Hanrnfiond who first stressed the principle that a nuclear reactor ought to scale rather favorably. 
Thus, although the total cost of a large nuclear reactor will be greater than that of a smaller one, the cost per kilowatt of the large reactor should be less than that of the smaller one. 
Hammond&#39;s contention has been amply confirmed by the price estimates published, for example, by the General Electric Company. 
Figure 1 shows that the cost per kilowatt of a 200 MW boiling-water reactor (BWR) is around $180/kW, whereas the cost per kilowatt of a 1000 Mw BWR is only $110/kW.
All the new, competitive nuclear power plants are large, and they capitalize on the advantage of size.  


<em>The Necessity for Breeders</em>.&emdash;Nuclear power at 2.4 mills/(kWh) at Browns Ferry is a remarkable achievement, but it is not remarkable enough to serve as the basis for a Nuclear Energy Revolution. 
In the first place, we are hopeful that breeder reactors can shave another mill off the cost and thus perhaps provide the basis for new heavy chemical and other industries. 
In the second place, the light-water reactors burn only a small fraction of all the natural uranium mined to fuel them; thus such reactors will rapidly use all the U. S. low-priced reserves of uranium ore, and the price of nuclear energy will rise as we are obliged to burn more expensive ores. 
This is illustrated in Figure 2, based by Dietrich\cite{} on estimates made a few years ago by the Atomic Energy Commission of U. S. ore reserves and reactors to be built.
Since then, ore prospecting has been resumed, but water reactor sales are outrunning the estimates. 


We therefore find ourselves in a serious dilemma. 
The current great success of nuclear energy is making our economy increasingly dependent upon nuclear power. 
But as we turn to nuclear energy we shall exhaust our low-grade ore reserves. 
By the time (say in 1990) we have become very heavily committed to nuclear energy, its price will probably begin to rise significantly. 


Of course we shall find more low-cost ore. 
But eventually even this will be insufficient, especially if our power requirements continue to grow. 
If we are to forestall a major economic power crisis, say 20 years from now, we shall have to learn how to utilize not 1 per cent or so of the raw materials (uranium and thorium) for fuel, but much more&emdash;hopefully close to 100 per cent. 
Should we learn how to burn a large fraction of the uranium and thorium, we would gain in three respects: we would forestall a serious rise in the cost of power; we would reduce the fuel cycle cost of a reactor, since in effect we would be burning the abundant and very cheap U<sup>238</sup> or Th<sup>232</sup>, not the costly U</sup>235</sup>; and we would make available, at relatively small economic penalty, the vast residual amounts of uranium and thorium in the earth&#39;s crust. 
To anticipate our conclusion, we could hope to achieve power costs of only 1.5 mills/(kWh) in publicly owned stations, and we could foresee maintaining this low cost essentially forever. 
It is this prospect, and what it implies for energy-consuming industrial processes, that warrants our using the extravagant phrase &ldquo;The Nuclear Energy Revolution.&rdquo;
