The billions upon billions of stars in the vast universe all have one thing in common&emdash;they are all immense masses of flaming gas. 
Heat evolved deep within this fiery sphere gives rise to the brilliant light which makes the star visible. Our nearest star&emdash;our sun&emdash;is the source of life on earth. 
Our planet is kept warm, the oceans remain unfrozen and crops grow because of solar warmth. 


Our planet, earth, is but a small sphere some eight thousand miles from rim to rim. 
It whirls through space and, caught in the invisible grip of the sun&#39;s gravitational attraction, orbits endlessly, maintaining an average distance from the sun of 93 million miles. 
At this distance the earth receives only a minute fraction of the vast outpouring of heat and light that the sun radiates. 
In fact, two billion times more heat flies off into space than strikes the earth. 


How does our sun manage to keep its heat furnaces stoked? 
How has it kept blazing away at this rate for five billion years? 
Is there any danger that it may &ldquo;run out of gas&rdquo;? 


Only recently, with the data turned up in nuclear research, has it been possible to answer these questions. 
Yet from the time of the primitive caveman, the sun has been an object of wonder and of worship. 
The ancients revered the Sun God and countless humans were sacrificed on bloody altars to assuage the fiery deity. 


In more modern times wonder turned to curiosity and curiosity to methodical investigation. 
Astronomers found that the sun is a million times bigger than the earth, that the temperature at the sun&#39;s surface is about six thousand degrees Centigrade, and that the temperature deep inside the core must be about fifteen million degrees Centigrade. 
Astrophysicists proved that no ordinary burning or chemical combustion could account for solar heat. 
They knew there was not enough oxygen to support such a combustion. 
All efforts to explain the sun&#39;s power failed; no energy source was powerful enough to account for such flaming heat over a period of five billion years. 
By all reckoning, the sun should have spent its energy long ago; it should be a dead cinder in the sky surrounded by lifeless, frozen planets&emdash;a darkness in the universe.  


Sir Arthur Eddington was the first scientist to speculate correctly about the source of the sun&#39;s energy. 
He suggested in 1920 that stars might gain energy from the combination or fusion of hydrogen to form more complex elements. 
This nuclear &ldquo;burning&rdquo; should release per atom a million times more energy than any known chemical process. 
Eight years later Frederic Houtermans and Robert Atkinson took the next step which turned speculation into theory. 
They calculated that hydrogen within the sun&#39;s core consisted of atoms so speedy (due to heat and pressure) that some collisions between hydrogen atoms would produce a thermonuclear reaction with the release of heat. 
We call this thermonuclear energy and, as the name implies, it is nuclear energy produced by heat-agitated atoms. 


Houtermans and Atkinson had practically no experimental data about the behavior of hydrogen atoms, so they had to proceed on pure theory. 
They knew that at the elevated temperatures inside the sun&#39;s core hydrogen atoms would be stripped of their electrons. 
They also knew that the great pressure due to the overweight of the sun&#39;s voluminous mass squeezed hydrogen nuclei (protons) so close together that the result was a proton paste eight times denser than solid lead. 
Houtermans and Atkinson calculated that hydrogen fusion could account for solar heat. 
However, they could not demonstrate that the fiery proton paste in the sun&#39;s core would actually sustain a thermonuclear reaction. 
They lacked the vital nuclear data to predict the behavior of protons at the temperature that exists inside our sun. 


At this point we must pause to show that the &ldquo;temperature&rdquo; and &ldquo;energy&rdquo; of protons or, for that matter, any particle, may be related. 
This is important because the nuclear behavior of a particle depends very strongly upon its energy (or its speed). 


Ordinarily, temperature is easy to define. 
We measure the temperature of a glass of water with a household thermometer. 
We may measure the temperature of a glowing object such as a lamp filament or an iron poker by using an instrument that relates the color of the object and temperature. 
An iron poker, at room temperature, emits no light, but as it is heated to higher and higher temperatures, it changes in color from dull, barely visible red to a glowing white. 
We say that the poker is white-hot. 
Thus we measure and define the temperature of liquids and solids. 


But how would you measure the temperature of a gas? 
At first thought, this seems easy, because we know we can glance at an outdoor thermometer and say that the temperature of the air is \ang{80}, or whatever it happens to be. 
But what about the temperature of the ionized gas inside a glowing neon tube? 
The glass walls of the tube are cool to the touch, but inside the tube the neon atoms dash about with astonishing speed, much much faster than the closely packed molecules in a white-hot poker. 
And what about the temperature of protons in a beam emerging from a cyclotron? Scientists say that an ionized atom moving with a certain speed has an energy of so many electron volts. 
But they can also measure this in terms of temperature on a scale in which one electron volt is equivalent to roughly ten thousand degrees Centigrade. 
On this scale, a 1 MeV (million electron volt) proton has a temperature equivalent of ten billion degrees Centigrade. 
As we shall see in the next chapter, cyclotrons easily accelerate protons to ten-million electron volts. 
This corresponds to protons of 100 billion degrees Centigrade, or vastly higher than the temperature of the sun&#39;s innermost protons. 


A Cornell University physics professor. Dr. Hans Bethe, next tackled the problem of explaining the sun&#39;s source of unending energy. 
In 1938 Bethe was in a much better position to make calculations than Houtermans and Atkinson had been a decade earlier, because experimental scientists had in the meantime come up with so much data about nuclear reactions. 
Thus Bethe was able to calculate how rapidly protons might combine with one another under conditions existing inside the sun. 


Dr. Bethe developed the theory that four protons successively fuse together to form a single atom of helium. 
This is not accomplished in one fell swoop, but is rather a multiple-stage process in which, first, two hydrogen protons collide and bind themselves together to become an atom of heavy hydrogen, or deuterium; this fused atom of heavy hydrogen is then struck by another proton and helium-3 is formed; finally another proton collision results in the formation of a nucleus of helium-4. 
The process Bethe envisaged could take place in either of two ways, but both amounted to a synthesis or fusion of four protons, with the release of 27 MeV of energy. 
The energy that is released comes from the mass &ldquo;lost&rdquo; when the four hydrogen atoms fuse into an intimate combination which is lighter than the sum of the individual masses of the H-atoms. 
The mass &ldquo;lost&rdquo; or energy released in a single fusion is small, but because of the enormous amount of hydrogen in the sun, the process occurs frequently enough to keep the sun blazing hot. 
Every second about one billion tons of hydrogen undergo fusion! 
About one million tons of &ldquo;Einstein mass&rdquo; are totally converted into energy every second. 


Yet this seemingly incredible amount of hydrogen is so small compared with the sun&#39;s total supply that the sun will continue to shine at its present rate for billions and billions of years before it runs out of fuel. 


If we consider the heat generated per given weight of the sun rather than the total heat produced, we arrive at some rather astonishing facts. 
On an average, it takes five hundred tons of the sun&#39;s mass to produce one hundred watts of heat, the amount given off from a household electric lamp bulb. 
Even at the sun&#39;s center, where the heat is given off at a greater rate, it still takes many tons of the sun&#39;s substance to evolve one hundred watts of heat. 
Actually, the human body&emdash;say that of an active teen-ager&emdash;generates one hundred times more heat than is generated by an equivalent weight of hydrogen gas in the sun. 
The explanation is not difficult. 
In the first place, we are not comparing body temperature with the temperature inside the sun; but rather the rates at which each produces its heat. 
The sun is almost perfectly insulated by its outer layers of gas, so that even a tiny amount of heat generated at its core, though produced at a much slower rate than in the human body, is kept hot. 
In other words, the sun&#39;s heat is trapped inside its immense mass and leaks out to the surface very gradually. 
Consequently, the sun continues to build up in temperature; whereas the human body, which is poorly insulated, loses heat rather easily. 
Even mild exposure to wind suffices to chill a person. 
One way to look at the problem is to imagine a mass the size of the sun composed of people jammed together as they are in a subway&emdash;that is, matter endowed with the heat-producing capacity of an equivalent mass of people. 
The heat generated would be so great that after a while it would blaze up spectacularly. 


The reason heat is evolved so slowly even in the center of the sun is that the hydrogen atoms are at such a low temperature. 
Roughly twenty million degrees Centigrade may not seem low, but from the standpoint of a nuclear reaction, the equivalent energy of the protons inside the sun&#39;s core is only \num{1 700} electron volts. 
This is a very low energy for nuclear reactions, since almost all the reactions studied with a cyclotron are measured at energies of millions of volts. 
Nuclear reactions, especially when we specify thermonuclear reactions, &ldquo;go&rdquo; faster at higher energies. 
This means that deep inside the sun the protons are very weak and fuse together so slowly that it takes millions of years for a hydrogen-helium cycle to occur. 
That is why our sun doesn&#39;t explode like a hydrogen bomb. 


Hydrogen bombs release their energy in less than one-millionth of a second. 
The main reason why such fast reactions can be attained is that heavy and extra-heavy hydrogen are fused in the bomb reaction. 
Deuterium (double-weight hydrogen) and tritium (triple-weight hydrogen) react violently in contrast to the slow fusion of ordinary or single-weight hydrogen. 


In their attempt to make a hydrogen bomb, the experts were up against a cost problem with regard to tritium, and thus it came as a real step ahead when they figured out a way to put a liner of lithium-6 next to the &ldquo;nuke&rdquo; in a bomb. 
The great flash of neutrons released in the explosion of the A-bomb trigger irradiates the lithium liner and gives birth to a burst of tritium atoms. 
The A-trigger also produces an intense heat wave. 


Bomb experts killed two birds with one stone by incorporating the lithium in the form of a chemical compound called lithium deuteride, a compound formed by the synthesis of lithium and heavy hydrogen. 
They were thus able to bring about the fusion of deuterium and tritium. 
As we have seen, the fusion process releases energy&emdash;in this case, 17.6 MeV for each fusion. This is significantly less than fission energy, but we must remember that a pound of a light element like lithium contains many more atoms than a pound of a heavy element like uranium and can release more energy. 


The energy released in the fusion of hydrogen comes off in the form of high-speed particles, just as in the case of fission.  
But there is a significant difference, for most of the energy is imparted to the neutron that is produced in the reaction. 
This neutron dashes off with the lion&#39;s share of the fusion energy. 
It is so speedy that it would tend to flash out into space and not make for a very effective bomb, if the bomb designers had not hit upon an ingenious idea. 


They decided to make the runaway neutron do some work in the bomb. 
They put a heavy jacket of ordinary uranium around the lithium liner. 
The fast-flying neutrons are trapped in this jacket and there they cause the atoms of U<sup>238</sup> to fission. 
The neutrons released in fission, you will recall, will not split U<sup>238</sup> as readily as they do U<sup>235</sup>.
This is because U<sup>235</sup> fissions with low-speed neutrons whereas U<sup>238</sup> does not. 
Neutrons produced in the chain reaction are not in general sufficiently speedy to fission U<sup>238</sup> But, and this is most significant, the neutrons released in hydrogen fusion are fast enough to cause U<sup>238</sup> to fission. 


This means, then, that the superbomb is really a three-stage device. 
Stage one involves the firing of an atomic bomb trigger. 
Stage two centers upon the manufacture of tritium from lithium and the fusion of the tritium and heavy hydrogen. 
Stage three is the fission of ordinary uranium by the fast-fusion neutrons produced in stage two. 


All these stages are interrelated by a complex neutron relationship. 
For example, when U<sup>238</sup> fissions in stage three, the neutrons produced feed back into the bomb core, causing more fission of the A-trigger and additional production of tritium. 
In addition, the explosion in stage three creates more heat to produce more fusion. 
These reactions are so complex and all happen so fast-in one-millionth of a second-that calculation of the bomb&#39;s power is exceedingly difficult and must be relegated to whirlwind automatic computers. 
These electronic brains are capable of lightning-like computation and permit the bomb designers to figure out how a given weapon might perform prior to actual test. 


Knowing from the reality of the H-bomb that hydrogen is useful in an explosive thermonuclear reaction, it is natural to ask if hydrogen fusion can be tamed to produce energy useful to man. 
Is it possible for man to imitate or outdo the sun&#39;s energy power? 


Before exploring this possibility further, it will help to have clearly in mind why scientists concentrate on hydrogen as a fuel, rather than some other element. 
Going back to Rutherford&#39;s experiments on the scattering of alpha particles, recall that only a very few of the alpha particles penetrated close to the nucleus in the target atom. 
As the positively charged alpha particles sped toward the positively charged nucleus of the atom, they were strongly repelled by the like electrical forces. 
The same thing happens when we try to bring together two alpha particles or two hydrogen nuclei or any two nuclei. 
They resist fusion because of the electrical repulsion of their positively charged cores. 
The greater the charge on the atomic nucleus, the greater will be the repulsion and hence the difficulty of fusing the two. 
This means that fusion is easiest for the lighter elements; and hydrogen, with its single proton, is of course the lightest of all. 


However, if man attempted to imitate nature&#39;s solar process for fusing ordinary hydrogen as fuel, he would be doomed to failure; as we saw earlier, the kind of hydrogen that is present in the sun&#39;s interior fuses very slowly, so that a single cubic inch of the central core will evolve only a fraction of a watt of heat energy. 
The fact of the matter is that ordinary hydrogen is too sluggish a nuclear fuel to support a controlled, man-made fusion reaction. 
However, as we know, other kinds of hydrogen exist: heavy hydrogen or deuterium, and the radioactive, extra-heavy form of hydrogen called tritium. 
Tritium or triple-weight hydrogen can be produced in a nuclear reactor by bombarding lithium with neutrons. 
Unlike ordinary hydrogen, deuterium and tritium react quickly to

create helium; it is this fact that will make controlled fusion power possible. 
These isotopes are known to undergo the following reactions: 

<figure>
%% Formulas use eqalign and ce
</figure>

All these reactions release energy. 
The first two yield 4.13 MeV and 3.37 MeV respectively, while the last two release 17.58 MeV and 11.32 MeV of energy. 


While the energy released by each fusion of hydrogen isotopes is considerably less than the 200 MeV for each fission of a uranium atom, as we noted earlier in the case of lithium, the number of atoms in a pound of hydrogen is very much greater than the number of atoms in a pound of uranium. 
A pound of deuterium, for instance, releases roughly three times as much energy as a pound of uranium. 
Converted into the energy content of the heavy hydrogen in a cup of water, this amounts to the heat equivalent of fifty pounds of coal. 
The supply of heavy hydrogen is practically without limit since the lakes and oceans on our planet contain inexhaustible reserves of water. 
Thus, if man can extract hydrogen fusion energy, he has at hand an unlimited new supply of fuel. 


The goal of hydrogen power is tempting for more than just this reason. 
Hydrogen fusion produces no residual radioactive fragments, so the radiation hazard of uranium fission products is not present in this new type of power source. 
Furthermore, because of the nature of the reactor that will probably be used to produce fusion power, there is no danger of a runaway explosion, such as can occur in certain types of uranium power plants. 
In addition, there is the enticing prospect that it may be possible to derive energy from a fusion reactor directly, in the form of electrical power. 


Attractive as these prospects appear, one has to consider the huge difficulties that stand in the road toward attaining fusion power. 
The basic fuel, deuterium, is no problem, since heavy water can be produced in hundred-ton lots and is readily available commercially at \$28 per pound. 
And there is no problem in obtaining pure deuterium gas from the heavy water. 
The fundamental problem is so to design a reactor that ionized deuterium, or hydrogen plasma as it is called, can be brought to sufficiently high speed for fusion to take place. 
This requires that a temperature above one hundred million degrees Centigrade be attained. 


Scientists in many countries are hard at work designing machines that will use electric and magnetic fields to squeeze hydrogen plasma together or &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; it. 
The basic idea was set forth in 1934 by the American physicist, W. H. Bennett.
He suggested that charged particles of hydrogen moving in a stream would constitute an electrical current that should induce its own magnetic fields; this, in turn, would act to pinch the plasma together, bringing the individual ions into collision with each other. 
The more violent the collisions (i.e., the &ldquo;hotter&rdquo; the pinch) and the more frequent they are, the greater is the probability that fusion will occur. 


Unfortunately, the phenomenon just described is not very easy to control or stabilize. 
In the United States, the Atomic Energy Commission established Project Sherwood for the purpose of bringing about the controlled release of fusion power. 
The research work, begun on a modest budget in 1951, expanded to a vigorous program in 1959, backed by a forty-million-dollar annual budget. 
A variety of experimental devices for studying the &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; effect have been built at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, of which the Perhapstron is an example. 
Hydrogen ions are circulated in a doughnut-shaped vacuum tube and constricted by an electrical current into a narrow column inside this chamber. 


A &ldquo;Magnetic Mirror&rdquo; device represents a different approach to the fusion problem adopted by scientists at the University of California&#39;s Livermore Laboratory. 
Instead of a doughnut chamber, a straight tube is employed and the hydrogen plasma is &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; by intense magnetic fields and &ldquo;reflected&rdquo; back from one end of the tube into the center of the chamber. 
Still another line of approach is shown in the illustration. 
Here at Oak Ridge, scientists are studying fusion possibilities by hurling heavy hydrogen molecules downward into a reaction chamber where they are ionized by an electric arc and then subjected to intense magnetic forces. 
A more ambitious and larger-scale approach to fusion power is under way at Princeton University, where a Stellerator is being constructed. 
Magnetic forces from a thick magnetic coil that is wrapped around a figure-8-shaped vacuum chamber center the hydrogen ions in the chamber. 
This unusual container is designed to keep the hydrogen ions from straying out to the wall and giving up their energy. 
Fusion power can be attained only if the plasma can be kept isolated from contact with the container. 


Obviously, no structural container can hold anything so hot as this fiery plasma. 
Instead, scientists propose to contain the plasma by means of magnetic fields which force the ions to stay in a restricted space, i.e., a kind of &ldquo;magnetic bottle.&rdquo; 

<figure>
\label{fig:37}

</figure>


However, there is the serious problem of designing such a magnetic &ldquo;container&rdquo; so that it is substantially leakproof. 
Any small leak would allow the hot plasma to squirt out to the tube wall and cool off, thus ruining chances of attaining the high temperatures necessary for fusion. 
Experiments in the United States have produced plasma at a temperature of about ten million degrees Centigrade. 


Fusion research is also going on in Russia, Britain, Sweden, Germany, Japan and many other countries. 
The British have pioneered in this new field of research and have constructed rather large machines. 
All machines concentrate on using deuterium as the reacting substance, although later experiments may be done with tritium. 
However, tritium is more difficult to handle experimentally because of the radiation hazard and the contamination of the equipment. 


If one selects pure deuterium as the nuclear fuel for fusion power, there is the attractive prospect that, since two-thirds of the energy comes off in the form of charged particles, it might be possible to convert this directly into electrical energy. 
Picturing the way a piston functions in a steam engine, one may think of moving plasma working against magnetic fields, and electrical circuits drawing off the energy. 
With a mixture of deuterium and tritium, the majority of the energy is carried off by the neutrons. 
A blanket of liquid lithium might be used to absorb the neutrons and convert their energy into heat and at the same time generate useful tritium as the lithium atoms are fissioned. 
Thus fusion power would be used to produce heat external to the plasma and this heat would then be used for the purposes of producing more power. 


The possibility of fusion power is raised at a time when uranium power plants are being engineered to produce power on a basis competitive with conventional fuels. 
Rising coal costs in England have provided the British with a strong incentive to replace coal with uranium and they have devoted tremendous effort to building uranium power stations. 
Now there is the question whether uranium power is not obsolete before it is even fully developed. 
Will not fusion of hydrogen replace uranium fission as man&#39;s source of energy? 
Ultimately, it seems clear that hydrogen fusion will be developed to the point where it is attractive for some applications, but this new source of power is in its technological infancy and it is too early to predict when it will assume its place in the sun. 
However, it can be said that many scientists who are working on this ultimate fuel are optimistic that they will be able to solve the very formidable problems that lie ahead. 
Furthermore, they feel that in their explorations of high-temperature plasmas and intense magnetic fields they will learn many new facts about atoms and the cosmos. 
Indeed, some scientists believe that even if hydrogen power should never succeed, should man be frustrated in his attempt to outdo the sun, he will gather rich dividends in fundamental knowledge, and the research will have been worth while. 
But the hope is that the quest for fusion power will bring to mankind an unlimited source of power to heat homes, light cities and power factories for millions of years to come.
