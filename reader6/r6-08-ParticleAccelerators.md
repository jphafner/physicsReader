From time to time in the course of history men have been swept up by intense currents of creative activity. 
In the pyramids of Egypt, in Greek sculpture and in Florentine painting we find monuments to such bursts of expression. 
My favorite example is the Gothic cathedrals that so magically sprang up in 12th- and 13th-century France, for I like to relate that magnificent preoccupation with construction to an obsession of our own time&emdash;the building of nuclear accelerators. 


Like nuclear physics today, religion at that time was an intense intellectual activity. 
It seems to me that the designer of an accelerator is moved by much the same spirit which motivated the designer of a cathedral. 
The esthetic appeal of both structures is primarily technological. 
In the Gothic cathedral the appeal is primarily in the functionality of the ogival construction&emdash;the thrust and counter-thrust that is so vividly evident. 
So, too, in the accelerator we feel a technological esthetic&emdash;the spirality of the orbits of the particles, the balance of electrical and mechanical motion, the upward surge of forces and events until an ultimate of height is reached, this time in the energy of the particles.
In both cases we find the architects working at the very limit of technical knowledge. 
In both there is intense competition between localities, regional and national. 
Both structures are expensive: a really large accelerator can cost $100 million; the cost of a cathedral, in terms of medieval economics, was possibly higher. 


But where a cathedral was a community enterprise, with many people in the region participating in its financing and construction, and nearly everyone in its enjoyment, an accelerator is esoteric. 
Its presence in a community is usually unknown and unsung. 
Few are the workers who help to build it, and fewer still are those who use it. 


So the accelerator building boom goes on largely unnoticed, but at a quickening pace. 
Cyclotions, the original &ldquo;atom smashers,&rdquo; are now dotted almost all over the globe. 
They have evolved into synchro-cyclotrons, and have reached their culmination in three giant machines, one at the University of California in Berkeley, another at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland and another in the US.S.R. 
These machines accelerate protons to energies of between 600 and 700 million electron volts (mev). 
Synchrotrons, another development, are even bigger and more powerful. 
The Cosmotron, a 2,200 ton monster at Brookhaven National Laboratory which emits 3-billion-electron-volt (bev) protons, is small compared to the 6 GeV, 10,000 ton} Bevatron at Berkeley. 
This in turn is topped by the 10 GeV, 36,000 ton Phasotron in the U.S.S.R. 
Two even larger machines are under construction at Brookhaven and CERN; they are designed to produce protons of 25 GeV to 30 GeV.
And still bigger accelerators are being planned.

## Nuclear Microscopes

Why? 
What is the purpose behind this almost feverish effort to build more and bigger machines? 
Perhaps the simplest answer is that accelerators are the microscopes of nuclear physics. 
We usually think of an accelerator as a sort of gun, producing high-speed particles which bombard the nucleus of the atom. 
But since particles are known to have wave properties, it is equally appropriate to say that the accelerator shines &ldquo;light&rdquo; on the nuclei, enabling us to &ldquo;see&rdquo; them. 


Now the resolving power of a microscope, i.e., its ability to distinguish small objects, depends on the wavelength of the light it employs. 
The shortest wavelength of visible light is about four \num{100 000}<sup>ths</sup> (\num{4e-5}) of a centimeter; with these waves one can perceive a microbe, of about the same length. 


To examine smaller things, biologists now use the electron microscope. 
The wavelength of a particle depends on its mass and its energy. 
At a few thousand electron volts&emdash;the energy at which electron microscopes operate-an electron has a wavelength some \num{10 000} times shorter than that of visible light (about \num{e-9} centimeter). 
With these waves one can begin to see the details of molecules. 


The nucleus of an atom is about \num{e-12} centimeter in diameter. 
This is the wavelength of a proton with an energy of 1 MeV.
To &ldquo;see&rdquo; the nucleus we therefore need a 1 MeV proton &ldquo;microscope,&rdquo; and to make out some of its internal details we need some 10 to 20 times as much energy. 
Thus a laboratory interested in classical nuclear physics will invariably have a Van de Graaff accelerator or a cyclotron operating in the range of 1 MeV to 20 MeV. 


But physics has pushed beyond this point. 
At present many of us are interested not in the nucleus as a whole but in the structure of the protons and neutrons (nucleons) of which it is composed. 
It is the old problem of worlds within worlds, for the proton itself turns out to have a rich structure. 
It is perhaps \num{e-13} centimeter in diameter, and to resolve it requires an energy of several hundred GeV. 
To see it in as fine detail as we can see the structure of the nucleus we must have still higher energy. 
It is for this reason that the 25 GeV to 30 GeV machines are under construction. 
If and when the structure of the proton is known, will its component parts turn out to have their own structure? 
Very possibly so, and if they do, machines of higher energy will be built to explore that structure. 


The microscope analogy does not tell the whole story. 
When we get to sufficiently short wavelengths (i.e., when the bombarding particles in our accelerators reach sufficiently high energy), we not only see particles, but we also make new ones. 
These new particles are created out of energy. 
At 1 MeV an electron has enough energy to create a pair of particles&emdash;an electron and a positron. 
At 150 MeV it makes pi mesons (pions) when it collides with a nucleon. 
Our 1 GeV electron accelerator at Cornell University produces more massive particles: K and lambda mesons. 
The Bevatron, which produces 6 GeV protons, is able to create antiprotons, antineutrons and still heavier particles such as xi and sigma mesons. 


Thus as the energy of the machines has increased it has become possible to create more and heavier new particles. 
Obviously the exciting next step is to attain even higher energies, and then to see what sort of monster particles are created. 
One has the very strong feeling that new particles will indeed show up. 
It may well turn out that they will prove to be only complexes of particles which we already understand; however, it is exactly to answer such questions that we are building the machines. 


Originally we constructed our accelerators in order to search for the ultimate in elementary particles. 
We expected these particles to be fragments and hence to be successively smaller; it was to improve our definition of them that we went to higher energies. 
Ironically the fragments now seem to get larger.
One has the uneasy feeling that new machines make new particles which lead to the construction of new machines, and so on ad infinitum. 
In fact, there may be lurking here a new kind of indeterminacy principle which will inherently limit our knowledge of the very small.

</figure>


So much for the reasons why accelerators are built. 
Let us turn to the machines themselves. 
All of them operate on the same fundamental principle: charged particles (electrons or positive ions usually protons) are put into an electric field which exerts a force on them, pushing them to high speeds and energies. 
(The electron volt, in which the energy is usually measured, is the energy acquired by a particle with one electronic unit of charge accelerated by a potential difference of one volt.) 
The simplest form of accelerator is a pipe along which a steady electric field accelerates the particles. 
This is the wellknown Van de Graaff machine. 
To obtain higher energies a long pipe may be used with several accelerating electrodes which kick the particles to higher and higher speeds as they travel down the tube [see &ldquo;The Linear Accelerator,&rdquo; by Wolfgang Panofsky; Scientific American, October, 1954]. 
But to attain a really high energy by this method would require an extremely long pipe. 
To get around this difficulty the particles can be made to travel in a circular or spiral path which brings them back through the same electrodes where the accelerating voltage is applied again and again.


It is with such circular machines that we are chiefly concerned in this article. 
In these machines the circular motion is brought about by magnetic fields. 
A magnetic field exerts a force on all electric charges that move through it; the force is always at right angles to the direction of the charges travel. 
It is the same kind of force that acts on a stone whirled at the end of a string. 
The magnetic field, like the string, forces the particles, to move in a circular path. 
The stronger the field, the sharper the curvature of the path; on the other hand, the faster or heavier the particle, the less it is curved by a given field [see diagrams on opposite page]. 


The simplest and oldest type of accelerator to make use of magnetic bending is the cyclotron. 
The operation of this machine can be most easily visualized by imagining a weight suspended by a string and pushed so as to describe a circular motion. 
As with any pendulum the time required to complete a full circular swing is the same whether the circle is small or large. 
Thus if the weight is pushed rhythmically it will move outward in an ever-widening circle, returning to the pushing point in the same time, on each revolution [see diagram above]. 
So it is in the cyclotron: each ion whirls inside of two semicircular electrodes or &ldquo;dees,&rdquo; getting an electrical push when it passes from one to the other. 
A vertical magnetic field provides a constant inward push and, like the string, holds the ion in a circular path and guides it back to the gap between the dees, where it is given another electrical push. 
The velocity of the ion then becomes greater and, as a result of its inertia, the curvature of the circular path caused by the magnetic field becomes larger. 
The time taken to traverse a full circle is the same no matter how big the radius, because the increase in speed just compensates for the increase in path-length per turn. 
Now if the voltage across the dees is made to oscillate rapidly, and if its period is adjusted so that it exactly matches the period of revolution of the ions, then the ions will be pushed in the right direction at the right time at each crossing of the gap between dees; the energy of the ions will build up until their path takes them to the edge of the magnetic field, where they can be used or extracted in the form of a beam.


If the cathedrals had great designers such as Suger of St. Denis and Sully of Notre Dame, the accelerators have their 
Cockcroft of Cambridge and Lawrence of Berkeley. 
In 1928 J. D. Cockcroft and E. T. S. Walton built a device in which a voltage generated between two electrodes accelerated ions to a high enough speed to cause the disintegration of a bombarded nucleus. 
They were still working in the magnificently simple tradition of Ernest Rutherford&#39;s laboratory at the University of Cambridge. 
A quite different tradition was established with the building of the first cyclotron by Ernest O. Lawrence in 1930. 
It has spread from his laboratory at the University of California and has come to dominate experimental nuclear physics in this country. 
Indeed, one can begin now to trace this spirit abroad, particularly to the U.S.S.R., where it may flourish even more vigorously than it does in the U. S. 


This tradition, called &ldquo;berkelitis&rdquo; by its detractors, is a true departure in experimental physics. 
Previously experimental equipment had been constructed to test a particular surmise or idea. 
But building a large accelerator is more analogous to outfitting a ship for an expedition of exploration, or to the construction of a huge telescope to study a variety of astronomical objects. 
After several cyclotrons had been built at Berkeley, the students and associates of Lawrence traveled far and wide to spread the gospel. 
By World War II they had helped to build cyclotrons not only at universities in the U. S., but also in several other countries. 
The biggest of these machines produced protons of about 10 MeV.
As we have seen, this is an appropriate energy for exploring the nucleus as a whole, but not for examining its parts. 
Just before the war Lawrence had begun to build a giant cyclotron, to enter the energy region above 100 MeV, with which he could start to probe nucleons.

## The Synchrotron

It was characteristic of Lawrence that he went ahead despite a prevalent conviction that the energy limit of the cyclotron was about 20 MeV. 
This conviction was based on an effect predicted by Albert Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity: particles traveling at nearly the speed of light will increase in mass. 
At 20 MeV a proton has entered this &ldquo;relativistic&rdquo; region, and further increases in energy will result not so much in greater speed as in greater mass. 
When this happens, the particle in a cyclotron begins to fall behind schedule as it spirals farther outward, and it no longer arrives between the dees at the right time to get a push from the oscillating voltage. 


The war interrupted work on Lawrence&#39;s big machine. 
Its huge magnet was used to separate isotopes of uranium for the atomic-bomb program. 
At the end of the war V. I. Veksler of the U.S.S.R. and E. M. McMillan of the University of California independently and almost simultaneously enunciated the so-called synchrotron principle. 
This principle showed the way to accelerating particles into the completely relativistic region. 
It was exactly the sort of deus ex machina that Lawrence had envisioned when he gkmbled some $1 million in starting his big cyclotron. 
The principle was immediately adopted. 
A successful synchro-cyclotron was built which produced protons in the region of 100 MeV (eventually 730 MeV). 
In the next few months a number of important features of the proton were discovered. 


To understand the synchrotron principle, it is easier to consider its application in the electron synchrotron rather than in the more complicated synchrocyclotron. 
Some half-dozen of these electron accelerators, with maximum energies of about 300 MeV, were also built just after the war. 


In a synchrotron electrons travel on a circular orbit inside a narrow doughnut-shaped vacuum vessel. 
At one point in the doughnut is a pair of accelerating electrodes across which there is an oscillating voltage like that in the cyclotron. 
A ring-shaped magnet surrounding the doughnut produces a field which forces the particle to travel on orbits close to the center of the tube [see diagram on opposite page]. 
The electrons are injected into the doughnut from a small linear accelerator at an energy of about 2 MeV.
At this energy their speed is some 98 per cent of the speed of light; hence they cannot travel much faster. 
To make matters simpler let us assume that the speed is exactly the speed of light and that the whole increase in energy goes into mass. 
Now imagine an electron in a circular orbit at the center of the doughnut. 
The electron is held there by a constant magnetic field. 
Also imagine that our oscillating voltage is applied, but that the electron crosses the accelerating gap just at the time when the voltage falls through its zero value. 
The frequency of the voltage is made the same as that of the electron traveling around its orbit at the constant speed of light. 
The electron now passes the gap on all subsequent turns just as the voltage becomes zero. 
Thus nothing happens; the electron remains on its orbit and keeps the same energy. 
Now we increase the magnetic field slightly. 
Since the energy (mass) is still the same, the particle is forced into a sharper curve, i.e., its orbit gets smaller. 
But because the orbit is smaller and the speed is constant, the time it takes the electron to return to the accelerating gap is shorter. 
Hence the electron arrives slightly before the voltage has fallen to zero; it is accelerated slightly. 
On the next turn, if the energy is still not large enough, the orbit will still be too small: the electron will arrive still earlier and be accelerated even more. 
Eventually the energy will increase enough (that is, the electron will get heavy enough) so that it is bent less sharply and edges out to its original orbit. 
If the energy should become too great, the orbit will be too big and the time it takes the electron to make each turn will be too long. 
This will cause the electron to drop behind the accelerating voltage and be pushed backward so that it will lose energy. 
Thus we have a beautiful automatic device for keeping the electron on the right orbit, or at least oscillating around the right orbit. 
That is all there is to the synchrotron principle or, as it is sometimes called, phase focusing.

</figure>

Now we can see that, if the magnetic field of the synchrotron is increased continuously, the energy of the electrons will also increase continuously; the electrons will receive energy at just the right rate to keep them on the central, or synchronous, orbit. 
In practice electrons can be injected into the doughnut when the magnetic field is rather weak (about 10 gauss) and ejected when the field is quite strong (more than 10,000 gauss). 
A synchrotron with a large enough radius can accelerate electrons up to energies of about 10 GeV. 
There are now about six machines, built or being built, which are designed to yield electron energies between 1 GeV and 1.5 GeV. 
At Cambridge, Mass., a 6 GeV electron synchrotron is being constructed by a joint Harvard University-Massachusetts Institute of Technology group. 


Let us return to the synchro-cyclotron. 
It works in essentially the same way as a synchrotron but it is shaped like a cyclotron. 
Instead of a varying magnetic field it has a constant field, but the frequency of the accelerating voltage applied to the dees is varied. 
This means that the synchronous orbit of the protons is not a fixed circle but a growing spiral. 


In another class of accelerators, the proton synchrotrons, both the magnetic field and the frequency of the accelerating voltage are varied. 
The increasing field counteracts the protons&#39; tendency to spiral outward as they get up to relativistic energies, and the orbit is again a fixed circle. 
Above about 5 GeV the protons are traveling practically at the speed of light, and from here on the proton synchrotron works just like an electron synchrotron.


If I may extend the figure of speech with which I began this article, each kind of accelerator has its own architectural style. 
To me synchro-cyclotrons are baroque. Proton synchrotrons are definitely Romanesque, although their rounded arches are horizontal. 
Electron synchrotrons have a lightness and grace that could only be Gothic. 


## The Newer Machines


This brings us more or less up to date in the evolution of accelerators. 
We may now ask whether we are near the end of this movement in physics or still at its beginning. 
The field still has tremendous vigor, and it is my guess that we are at about the same stage as the cathedral builders were after they had completed Notre Dame of Paris. 
The significant innovations were behind them, but most of their masterpieces were yet to come.

</figure>

Early in this article I mentioned that two machines now under construction, one at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the other at CERN in Geneva, will produce protons of 25 GeV to 30 GeV. 
Both of these machines are proton synchrotrons; each will cost between $20 million and $30 million. 
The diameter of the orbit traveled by their protons will be nearly 1,000 feet! 


These machines were made possible by the discovery at Brookhaven of a new principle called strong focusing [see &ldquo;A 100-Billion-Volt Accelerator,&rdquo; by Ernest D. Courant; Scientific American, May, 1953]. 
This principle involves a reshaping of the guiding magnetic field so that the particles are held much closer to their ideal orbit. 
It means that the doughnut can be thinner, and the surrounding magnet smaller and lighter. 


Until now we have considered only the radius of the orbit, i.e., the size of the circle on which the particles travel. 
However, the particles can not only drift in and out but also up and down; thus they must be focused vertically as well as horizontally. 
In old-style synchrotrons the lines of force in the magnetic field are bowed slightly outward [see diagram on page 6]. 
This has the effect of forcing particles back toward the center line when they move above or below it. 
But the bowed field gets somewhat weaker with the distance from the center line. 
Hence a particle that wanders too far from the center line is not strongly pushed back toward it. 


In strong focusing the field is broken into sectors which are alternately bowed outward and inward [see diagram on page 7]. 
The sectors bowed outward provide sharp vertical focusing, but are even worse than the old field-shape at bringing a particle in from an orbit that is too large. 
In other words, they do not focus radially. 
On the other hand, the sectors bowed inward increase in strength as the radius gets bigger, and provide strong radial focusing. 
Vertically, however, they have the wrong effect on the particles, tending to spread rather than to focus them. 
It turns out that each of the defocusing influences is overbalanced by the focusing effect of the other sector; the net result is a much more tightly restricted beam. 
This method of focusing was successfully used in the Cornell 1 GeV electron synchrotron, and it will be applied in the 6 GeV Harvard&endash;M.I.T. electron synchrotron. 


Not to be outdone by CERN and Brookhaven, the U.S.S.R. has announced that it will build a 50 GeV strong-focusing proton synchrotron. 
The magnet will weigh about 22,000 tons and will have a diameter of 1,500 feet.
It would seem that whatever we do, our Soviet friends can do too&emdash;and with a factor of two in their favor. 


## &ldquo;FFAG&rdquo;


The most exciting recent development in this country has been the &ldquo;fixed-field alternating-gradient&rdquo; accelerator proposed by Keith R. Symon of the Midwestern Universities Research Association (MURA). 
The so-called FFAG machine is really a rococo cyclotron in which the magnetic field is shaped in such a way as to allow the cyclotron to work into the high-energy relativistic region. 
We have already seen how the ordinary cyclotron is limited to accelerating protons to about 20 MeV. 
When this hmitation was first pointed out in 1938, L. H. Thomas of the Ohio State University suggested a way to get around it. 
He proposed to scallop the pole tips of the cyclotron magnet so that the surfaces would consist of a series of ridges running out from the center, with valleys in between. 
Thomas showed that the strength of the resulting field would increase toward the outside, compensating for the protons&#39; relativistic increase in mass, and would also focus the protons so that they would stay in the vacuum chamber. 
Thomas&#39;s scheme was far too complicated for the techniques of the time, and it was ignored. 
Now we realize that he had anticipated the strong-focusing principle. 
Two Thomastype cyclotrons are now under construction, one at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the other at Berkeley. 
Both of them will produce protons and deuterons in the range of several hundred MeV. 


We can now understand an FFAG type of accelerator if we imagine that the radial scallops of the Thomas magnet are twisted into spiral ribs. 
(Is this the flamboyant style that presaged the end of the Gothic period?) 
The twisting introduces an additional kind of strong focusing. 
In fact, the idea grew out of strong focusing; only later was its similarity to the Thomas cyclotron recognized. 
The idea of FFAG has been exploited to the full by the workers of the MURA laboratory at Madison, Wis. 
They have imagined and computed (using two high-speed computing machines) all sorts of variations of the FFAG geometry, and have built several models that have successfully demonstrated the practicality of the scheme.


The advantage of the fixed-field design is twofold. 
First, it is easier to control a constant field than a varying one. 
Second, the fixed-field machines can be operated continuously, whereas the synchrotrons and synchro-cyclotrons must operate cyclically, or in pulses, a new cycle starting each time the field reaches its maximum value. 
Continuous operation means that more accelerated ions are produced per unit time; in other words, the beam has a higher intensity.

}
</figure>


According to the MURA workers, the increased intensity that can be obtained with FFAG machines will make it possible to circumvent a serious limitation on accelerators which I have not mentioned as yet. 
This hmitation concerns the amount of energy that is actually available to produce the reactions we are looking for. 


When a high-energy ion from an accelerator strikes a stationary target particle, part of the energy goes into moving the target, and is wasted. 
It is as if we were trying to break a stone by hitting it with a hammer. 
To the extent that the hammer blow simply moves the stone, the energy is not available for breaking it. 
Now if the hammer is very light and the stone very heavy, we can see that the target will not move very far; almost all the energy of the hammer will go into breaking or chipping the stone. 
If we use a heavy sledge on a light pebble, most of the energy goes into moving the stone, and very little of it is available for breaking the stone. 
If the hammer and stone weigh the same, they will tend to move off together with half the speed of the incoming hammer; exactly half the energy will be available for breaking the stone. 


It is the same with atom-smashing. 
But here relativity plays a particularly dirty trick, robbing us of most of the advantage to be gained by increasing the energy of the bombarding particles. 
We have seen that really high energies mean an increase in mass. 
Thus as we go up in energy we increase the weight of our &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; and lose a larger and larger fraction of its energy. 
At 1 GeV a proton is already noticeably heavier than when it is at rest; when it hits a stationary proton, 57 per cent of the energy is wasted and only 0.43 GeV is available for useful purposes. 
At 3 GeV (the energy of the Brookhaven Cosmotron), the available portion is 1.15 GeV; at 6 GeV (the Berkeley Bevatron) the available portion is 2 GeV; at 10 GeV, 2.9 GeV are available; at 50 GeV, 7.5; at 100 GeV, 10.5.
We see that increasing the energy 100 times from one to 100 GeV results in only a 20 fold actual gain. 


Suppose, however, that instead of firing a moving particle at a stationary one, we arrange a head-on collision between two high-energy particles. 
Then the mass increase is neutralized, and there is no tendency for the colliding particles to move one way or the other. 
All the energy of both of them is now available for the desired reactions. 
This is what the MURA designers propose. 


They have envisaged a bold design, called &ldquo;synchroclash,&rdquo; in which two 15 GeV accelerators are placed so that their proton beams intersect and the particles collide with each other. 
This will yield an available energy of 30 GeV, whereas in the case of a 30 GeV proton colliding with a proton at rest only 6 GeV would be available. 
In fact, to attain a useful energy of 30 GeV in the ordinary way would mean using at least 500 GeV. 
The success of the synchroclash idea turns on the intensity of the accelerator beams: there must be enough protons to make collisions reasonably frequent. 
The MURA proposal languished for, several years, but interest in it seems to have revived. 
Perhaps the complicated orbits of the artificial satellites have had something to do with the new willingness to consider attempting the complicated orbits of FFAG. 


## Soviet Ideas


The Soviet designers have gone off in different directions. 
Veksler has been thinking of a scheme in which one approaches the ideal accelerator, namely one in which the accelerating field appears exactly in the vicinity of the ions but nowhere else. 
He envisages a small bunch of ions in a plasma (a gas of ions) exciting oscillations or waves in an electron beam. 
These waves are to act together coherently to give an enormous push to the ions being accelerated. 
If this is not clear to the reader, it is because it is not clear to me. 
The details have managed to escape most of us because of a linguistic ferrous curtain, but Veksler speaks of the theoretical possibility of attaining energies up to 1,000 GeV.
The proof of the idea must wait until it is put into practice. 
It should be remarked, however, that other wild schemes of Veksler, for example the synchrotron principle, are incorporated into most of our conventional accelerators today. 


G. I. Budker of the U.S.S.R. has also presented some speculative ideas which have obviously been inspired by efforts to produce controlled thermonuclear reactions. 
Budker proposes an intense circular electron beam maintained by a weak magnetic guide field. 
The high current of the beam will cause it to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; to a very small diameter because of its own magnetic field. 
The idea then is to use the very strong local magnetic field around the pinched beam as the guide field of a conventional accelerator [see diagram on page 13]. 
With an electron beam six meters in diameter one could expect to hold protons with an energy as high as 100 GeV. 
Budker and his colleagues have constructed a special accelerator in which they have achieved a 10 amperes current of 3 MeV elections, and they expect to attain much higher currents and energies before long. 
It could well be that something really revolutionary will come out of this energetic work.

Our own thermonuclear program has inspired research on very strong magnetic fields [see &ldquo;Strong Magnetic Fields,&rdquo; by Harold P. Furth et al.; <em>Scientific American</em>, February]. 
It seems likely that this development will find an application to the guidance of particles in multi-GeV accelerators. 


## Electron Accelerators

These new machines we have been discussing are proton accelerators, but there is vigorous activity in electron machines as well. 
We have already mentioned the Harvard-M.I.T. synchrotron which will attain 6 GeV to 7.5 GeV, and the half-dozen other smaller machines in the billion-volt range. 
The 220 foot linear electron accelerator at Stanford University has been on the scene for some time. 
Its energy has steadily increased so that it may now be used in experiments at 600 MeV. 
We expect td welcome it to the 1 GeV club before long. 


The linear machine is significant because there is a special difficulty in reaching high energy with electron synchrotrons. 
When electrons are made to travel on a curved path at high speeds they give off strong electromagnetic radiation. 
The effect is easily visible to the naked eye; the luminous horizontal beam on the cover of this issue of Scientific American is synchrotron radiation. 
The difficulty is that this radiation can represent a substantial loss of energy, and it increases rapidly as the energy of the machine goes up. 
In the Harvard-M.I.T.  synchrotron the amount of energy radiated is almost prohibitive (about 10 MeV per turn at 7.5 GeV).
To reach higher energies, say 20 GeV, the Stanford group has been thinking in terms of a linear accelerator, which does not have this radiation difficulty because its particles do not move in a circle. 
Such a machine might be as much as three miles long. 


I am not convinced that the limit of electron synchrotrons has been reached. 
Indeed, it is not difficult to imagine a 50 GeV electron synchrotron. 
The radiation problem would be solved by reducing the curvature of the electron beam, that is, by increasing its radius to, say, half a mile. 
I believe that the upper limit of the electron synchrotron may be as high as 100 MeV. 


While we are &ldquo;thinking big&rdquo; we should not forget Enrico Fermi&#39;s proposal to ring the earth with a vacuum tube and, using the earth&#39;s magnetic field, obtain 100,000 GeV. 
For that matter, now that artificial satellites are commonplace, we might put up a ring of satellites&emdash;each containing focusing magnets, accelerators, injectors and so on&emdash;around the earth. 
Something like a million million electronvolts could be expected from this accelerator, which we might as well call the lunatron. 
At the very least such a device will eliminate the need for vacuum pumps, since it will be outside the atmosphere. 


Villard de Honnecourt and later Viollet-le-Duc have left us detailed accounts of the builders of cathedrals and of their methods. 
It seems to be pretty much the same story then and now. 
The designer of the cathedral was not exactly an architect, nor is the designer of an accelerator exactly a physicist. 
Both jobs require a fusion of science, technology and art. 
The designers of cathedrals were well acquainted with each other; the homogeneity of their work in different countries is evidence of a considerable interchange of information. 
The homogeneity of accelerator design demonstrates the same interchange today. 
Our medieval predecessors were only human; one gets the definite impression that they were subject to petty jealousies, that occasionally there was thievery of ideas, that sometimes their motivation was simply to impress their colleagues or to humiliate their competitors. 
All these human traits are occasionally displayed by their modern counterparts. 
But one also gets a strong impression of the excitement of those mighty medieval creators as they exulted in their achievements. 
This sense of excitement is no less intense among modern nuclear physicists.
