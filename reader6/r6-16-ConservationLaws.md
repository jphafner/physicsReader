In a slow and subtle, yet inexorable, way conservation laws have moved in the past few centuries from the role of interesting sidelight in physics to the most central position. 
What little we now understand about the interactions and transformations of particles comes in large part through certain conservation laws which govern elementary-particle behavior. 


A conservation law is a statement of constancy in nature. 
If there is a room full of people, say, at a cocktail party, and no one comes in or leaves, we can say that there is a law of conservation of the number of people; that number is a constant. 
This would be a rather uninteresting law. But suppose the conservation law remained valid as guests came and went. 
This would be more interesting, for it would imply that the rate of arrival of guests was exactly equal to the rate of departure. 
During a process of change, something is remaining constant. 
The significant conservation laws in nature are of this type, laws of constancy during change. 
It is not surprising that scientists, in their search for simplicity, fasten on conservation laws with particular enthusiasm, for what could be simpler than a quantity that remains absolutely constant during complicated processes of change. 
To cite an example from the world of particles, the total electric charge remains precisely constant in every collision, regardless of how many particles may be created or annihilated in the process. 


The classical laws of physics are expressed primarily as laws of change, rather than as laws of constancy. 
Newton&#39;s law of motion describes how the motion of objects responds to forces that act upon them. 
Maxwell&#39;s equations of electromagnetism connect the rate of change of electric and magnetic fields in space and time. 
The early emphasis in fundamental science was rather naturally on discovering those laws which successfully describe the changes actually occurring in nature. Briefly, the &ldquo;classical&rdquo; philosophy concerning nature&#39;s laws is this. 
Man can imagine countless possible laws, indeed infinitely many, that might describe a particular phenomenon. Of these, nature has chosen only one simple law, and the job of science is to find it. 
Having successfully found laws of change, man may derive from them certain conservation laws, such as the conservation of energy in mechanics. 
These appear as particularly interesting and useful consequences of the theory, but are not themselves taken as fundamental statements of the theory. 


Gradually conservation laws have percolated to the top in the hierarchy of natural laws. 
This is not merely because of their simplicity, although this has been an important factor. 
It comes about also for two other reasons. 
One is the connection between conservation laws and principles of invariance and symmetry in nature&emdash;surely, one of the most beautiful aspects of modern science. 
The meaning of this connection will be discussed near the end of this chapter. 
The other reason we want to discuss here might best be described simply as a new view of the world, in which conservation laws appear naturally as the most fundamental statements of natural law. 
This new view is a view of order upon chaos&emdash;the order of conservation laws imposed upon the chaos of continual annihilation and creation taking place in the submicroscopic world. 
The strong hint emerging from recent studies of elementary particles is that the only inhibition imposed upon the chaotic flux of events in the world of the very small is that imposed by the conservation laws. 
Everything that can happen without violating a conservation law does happen. 


This new view of democracy in nature&emdash;freedom under law&emdash;represents a revolutionary change in man&#39;s view of natural law. 
The older view of a fundamental law of nature was that it must be a law of permission. 
It defined what can (and must) happen in natural phenomena. 
According to the new view, the more fundamental law is a law of prohibition. 
It defines what cannot happen. 
A conservation law is, in effect, a law of prohibition. 
It prohibits any phenomenon that would change the conserved quantity, but otherwise allows any events. 
Consider, for example, the production of pions in a proton-proton collision, 

\begin{equation*}
    p + p \longrightarrow p + p + \pi + \pi + \pi + \cdots 
\end{equation*}

If a law of permission were operative, one might expect that, for protons colliding in a particular way, the law would specify the number and the type of pions produced. 
A conservation law is less restrictive. 
The conservation of energy limits the number of pions that can be produced, because the mass of each one uses up some of the available energy. 
It might say, for example, that not more than six pions can be produced. 
In the actual collision there might be none, or one, or any number up to six. 
The law of charge conservation says that the total charge of the pions must be zero, but places no restriction on the charge of any particular pion; this could be positive, negative, or neutral. 


To make more clear the distinction between laws of permission and laws of prohibition, let us return to the cocktail party. 
A law of change, which is a law of permission, might describe the rate of arrival and the rate of departure of guests as functions of time. 
In simplest form, it might say that three guests per minute arrive at 6:00, two guests per minute at 6:15, and so on. 
Or it might say, without changing its essential character as a law of permission, that the rate of arrival of guests is given by the formula: 

\begin{equation*}
    R = \frac{A}{\pi D} \frac{1}{1 = \left(T-5-2\frac{A}{D}\right)^2} ,
\end{equation*}

where <span class="math">R</span> is the number of guests arriving per minute, <span class="math">A</span> is the annual income of the host in thousands of dollars, <span class="math">D</span> is the distance in miles from the nearest metropolitan center, and <span class="math">T</span> is the time of day. 
This law resembles, in spirit, a classical law of physics. 
It covers many situations, but for any particular situation it predicts exactly what will happen. 


A conservation law is simpler and less restrictive. 
Suppose it is observed that between 7 and 10 o&#39;clock the number of guests is conserved at all parties. 
This is a grand general statement, appealing for its breadth of application and its simplicity. 
It would, were it true, be regarded as a deep truth, a very profound law of human behavior. 
But it gives much less detailed information than the formula for <span class="math">R</span> above. 
The conservation law allows the guests to arrive at any rate whatever, so long as guests depart at the same rate. 
To push the analogy with natural law a bit further, we should say that according to the old view, since cocktail-party attendance is a fundamental aspect of human behavior, we seek and expect to find simple explicit laws governing the flow of guests. 
According to the new view, we expect to find the flux of arriving and departing guests limited only by certain conservation principles. 
Any behavior not prohibited by the conservation laws will, sooner or later, at some cocktail party, actually occur. 


It should be clear that there is a close connection between this view of nature and the fundamental role of probability in nature. 
If the conservation law does not prohibit various possible results of an experiment, as in the proton-proton collision cited above, then these various possibilities will occur, each with some definite probability. 
The very fact that we can use the word chaos to describe the creation and annihilation events occurring continually among the particles rests on the existence of laws of probability. 
At best the probability, never the certainty, of these endless changes in the particle world can be known. 


Are the laws of probability themselves derivable from conservation laws? 
The answer to this question is not yet known, but the trend of recent history is enough to make this author and many other physicists willing to bet on the affirmative. 
It appears possible, at least, that the conservation laws may not only be the most fundamental laws, but may be all the laws. 
They may be sufficient to characterize the elementary-particle world completely, specifying not only which events may occur and which are forbidden, but giving also the relative probabilities of those events which do occur.


We have so far emphasized that a conservation law is less restrictive than an explicit law of change, or law of permission. 
However, there are a number of different conservation laws and, taken all together, they may be very strongly restrictive, far more so than any one taken alone. 
In the ideal case, they may leave open only one possibility. 
The laws of prohibition, all taken together, then imply a unique law of permission. 
The most beautiful example of this kind of power of conservation laws concerns the nature of the photon. 
From conservation principles alone, it has been possible to show that the photon must be a massless particle of unit spin and no charge, emitted and absorbed by charged particles in a particular characteristic way. 
This truly amazing result has been expressed vividly by J. J. Sakurai who wrote recently, &ldquo;The Creator was supremely imaginative when he declared, &#39;Let there be light.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    Annals of Physics, Volume 11, page 5 (1960). 
}
In the world of human law, a man so hemmed in by restrictions that there is only one course of action open to him is not very happy. 
In the world of natural law it is remarkable and satisfying to learn that a few simple statements about constant properties in nature can have locked within them such latent power that they determine uniquely the nature of light and its interaction with matter. 


There are conservation laws and conservation laws. 
That is, some things in nature are constant, but others are even more constant. 
To convert this jargon into sense, some quantities in nature seem to be absolutely conserved, remaining unchanged in all events whatever; other quantities seem to be conserved in some kinds of processes and not in others. 
The rules governing the latter are still called conservation laws, but nature is permitted to violate them under certain circumstances. 
We shall postpone the discussion of these not-quite-conservation laws to Chapter Eight, and consider here only seven of the recognized absolute conservation laws. 
(There are two more absolute conservation laws of a more special kind, and they are also postponed to Chapter Eight.) 


We begin by listing by name the seven quantities that are conserved: 

1. Energy (including mass) 

2. Momentum 

3. Angular momentum, including spin 

4. Charge 

5. Electron-family number 

6. Muon-family number 

7. Baryon-family number. 

There are two different kinds of quantities here, which can be called properties of motion and intrinsic properties, but the two are not clearly separated. 
The intrinsic particle properties that enter into the conservation laws are mass, spin, charge, and the several &ldquo;family numbers.&rdquo; 
The properties of motion are kinetic energy, momentum, and angular momentum, the last frequently being called orbital angular momentum to avoid possible confusion with intrinsic spin, which is a form of angular momentum. 
In the laws of energy conservation and angular-momentum conservation, the intrinsic properties and properties of motion become mixed. 


The interactions and transformations of the elementary particles serve admirably to illustrate the conservation laws and we shall focus attention on the particles for illustrative purposes. 
It is through studies of the particles that all of these conservation laws have been verified, although the first four were already known in the macroscopic world. 
The particles provide the best possible testing ground for conservation laws, for any law satisfied by small numbers of particles is necessarily satisfied for all larger collections of particles, including the macroscopic objects of our everyday world. 
Whether the extrapolation of the submicroscopic conservation laws on into the cosmological domain is justified is uncertain, since gravity, whose effects in the particle world appear to be entirely negligible, becomes of dominant importance in the astronomical realm. 


Various intrinsic properties of the particles were discussed in Chapter One, and we shall examine first the conservation laws that have to do with the intrinsic properties. 


We learned in Chapter One that every particle carries the same electric charge as the electron (defined to be negative), or the equal and opposite charge of the proton (positive), or is neutral. 
The charge is a measure of the strength of electric force which the particle can exert and, correspondingly, a measure of the strength of electric force which the particle experiences. 
A neutral particle, of course, neither exerts nor responds to an electric force. 
A charged particle does both. 


Using the proton charge as a unit, every particle&#39;s charge can be labeled $+1$, <span class="math">&minus;1</span>, or <span class="math">0</span>.
The law of charge conservation requires that the total charge remain unchanged during every process of interaction or transformation. 
For any event involving particles, then, the total charge before the event must add up to the same value as the total charge after it. 
In the decay of a lambda into a neutron and a pion, 

\begin{equation*}
    \Lambda^0 \longrightarrow n + \pi^0 ,
\end{equation*}

the charge is zero both before and after. 
In the positive pion decay, 

\begin{equation*}
    \pi^+ \longrightarrow \mu^{+} + \nu_{mu} ,
\end{equation*}

the products are a positive muon and a neutral neutrino. 
A possible high-energy nuclear collision might proceed as follows: 

\begin{equation*}
    p + p \longrightarrow n + \Lambda^0 + K^+ + \pi^+ .
\end{equation*}

%% Blurry Page not read

in any number. 
In a typical proton-proton collision the number of baryons (2) remains unchanged, as in the example, 

\begin{equation*}
    p + p \longrightarrow p + \Sigma^+ + K^0 .
\end{equation*}

These and numerous other examples have made it appear that the number of baryons remains forever constant&emdash;in every single event, and therefore, of course, in any larger structure. 


Each of the $\Xi$, $\Sigma$, and $\Lambda$ particles, and the neutron, undergoes spontaneous decay into a lighter baryon. 
But the lightest baryon, the proton, has nowhere to go. 
The law of baryon conservation stabilizes the proton and makes possible the structure of nuclei and atoms and, therefore, of our world. 
From the particle physicist&#39;s point of view, this is a truly miraculous phenomenon, for the proton stands perched at a mass nearly 2,000 times the electron mass, having an intrinsic energy of about one billion electron volts, while beneath it lie the lighter unstable kaon, pion, and muon. 
Only the law of baryon conservation holds this enormous energy locked within the proton and makes it a suitable building block for the universe. 
The proton appears to be absolutely stable. 
If it is unstable it has, according to a recent experimental result, a half life greater than \SI{7e27}{\year}, or about a billion billion times the age of the earth. 


Our statement of the law of baryon conservation needs some amplification, for we have not yet taken into account antibaryons. 
A typical antiproton-production event at the Berkeley Bevatron might go as follows: 

\begin{equation*}
    p + p \longrightarrow p + p + p + \bar{p} .
\end{equation*}

(The bar over the letter designates the antiparticle. 
Since the antiproton has negative charge, the total charge of plus 2 is conserved.) 
It appears that we have transformed two baryons into four. 
Similarly, in the antiproton annihilation event, 

\begin{equation*}
    p + \bar{p} \longrightarrow \pi_+ + \pi^- + \pi^0 .
\end{equation*}

two baryons have apparently vanished. 
The obvious way to patch up the law of baryon conservation is to assign to the antiparticles baryon number <span class="math">&minus;1</span>, and to the particles baryon number $+1$. 
Then the law would read: In every event the total number of baryons minus the total number of antibaryons is conserved; or, equivalently, the total baryon number remains unchanged. 


The cynic might say that with so many arbitrary definitions&emdash;which particles should be called baryons and which not, and the use of negative baryon numbers&emdash;it is no wonder that a conservation law can be constructed. 
To this objection, two excellent answers can be given. 
The first is that it is not so easy to find an absolute conservation law. 
To find any quantity absolutely conserved in nature is so important that it easily justifies a few arbitrary definitions. 
The arbitrariness at this stage of history only reflects our lack of any deep understanding of the reason for baryon conservation, but it does not detract from the obvious significance of baryon conservation as a law of nature. 
The other answer, based on the mathematics of the quantum theory, is that the use of negative baryon number for antiparticles is perfectly natural, in fact, is demanded by the theory. 
This comes about because the description of the appearance of an antiparticle is &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; (in a mathematical sense we cannot delve into) to the description of the disappearance of a particle; and conversely antiparticle annihilation is &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; to particle creation. 


The &ldquo;electron family&rdquo; contains only the electron and its neutrino, the &ldquo;muon family&rdquo; only the muon and its neutrino. 
For each of these small groups, there is a conservation of family members exactly like the conservation of baryons. 
The antiparticles must be considered negative members of the families, the particles positive members. 
These light-particle conservation laws are not nearly as well tested as the other absolute conservation laws because of the difficulties of studying neutrinos, but there are no known exceptions to them. 

The beta decay of the neutron, 

\begin{equation*}
    n \longrightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu_e} ,
\end{equation*}


illustrates nicely the conservation laws we have discussed. 
Initially, the single neutron has charge zero, baryon number 1, and electron-family number zero. 
The oppositely charged proton and electron preserve zero charge; the single proton preserves the baryon number; and the electron with its antineutrino ($\bar{\nu_e}$) together preserve zero electron-family number. 
In the pion decay processes, 

\begin{align*}
    \pi^+ \longrightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_{\mu} &
    \text{and} &
    \pi^- \longrightarrow \mu^- + \bar{\nu_{\mu}} ,
\end{align*}


muon-family conservation demands that a neutrino accompany the $\mu^+$ antimuon, and an antineutrino accompany the $\mu^-$ muon. 
The muon, in turn, decays into three particles, for example,

\begin{equation*}
    \mu^- \longrightarrow e^- + \nu_{\mu} + \bar{\nu_{e}} ,
\end{equation*}

which conserves the members of the muon family and of the electron family. 

The general rule enunciated earlier in this chapter was that whatever can happen without violating a conservation law does happen. 
Until 1962, there was a notable exception to this rule; its resolution has beautifully strengthened the idea that conservation laws play a central role in the world of elementary particles. 
The decay of a muon into an electron and a photon, 

\begin{equation*}
    \mu^- \longrightarrow e^- + \gamma ,
\end{equation*}

has never been seen, a circumstance which had come to be known as the $\mu$-<span class="math">e</span>-$\gamma$ puzzle. 
Before the discovery of the muon&#39;s neutrino it was believed that electron, muon, and one neutrino formed a single family (called the lepton family) with a single family-conservation law. 
If this were the case, no conservation law prohibited the decay of muon into electron and photon, since the lost muon was replaced with an electron, and charge and all other quantities were conserved as well. 
According to the classical view of physical law, the absence of this process should have caused no concern. 
There was, after all, no law of permission which said that it should occur. 
There was only the double negative: No conservation law was known to prohibit the decay. 


However, the view of the fundamental role of conservation laws in nature as the only inhibition on physical processes had become so ingrained in the thinking of physicists that the absence of this particular decay mode of the muon was regarded as a significant mystery. 
It was largely this mystery that stimulated the search for a second neutrino belonging exclusively to the muon. 
The discovery of the muon&#39;s neutrino established as a near certainty that the electron and muon belong to two different small families which are separately conserved. 
With the electron and muon governed by two separate laws of conservation, the prohibition of the $\mu$-<span class="math">e</span>-$\gamma$ decay became immediately explicable, and the faith that what can happen does happen was further bolstered. 


We turn now to the conservation laws which involve properties of motion. 


In the world of particles there are only two kinds of energy: energy of motion, or kinetic energy, and energy of being, which is equivalent to mass. 
Whenever particles are created or annihilated (except the massless particles) energy is transformed from one form to the other, but the total energy in every process always remains conserved. 
The simplest consequence of energy conservation for the spontaneous decay of unstable particles is that the total mass of the products must be less than the mass of the parent. 
For each of the following decay processes the masses on the right add up to less than the mass on the left: 

\begin{align*}
    K^+  &\longrightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^+ + \pi^+ ,
    \Xi^- &\longrightarrow \Lambda^0 + \pi^- ,
    \mu^+ &\longrightarrow e^+ + \nu_e + \bar{\nu_{\mu}} ,
\end{align*}

In particular, then, a massless particle cannot decay, and energy conservation prohibits every other &ldquo;uphill&rdquo; decay in which the products are heavier than the parent. 
An unstable particle at rest has only its energy of being, no energy of motion. 
The difference between this parent mass and the mass of the product particles is transformed into kinetic energy which the product particles carry away as they rapidly leave the scene. 


One might suppose that if the parent particle is moving when it decays it has some energy of motion of its own which might be transformed to mass. 
The conservation of momentum prohibits this. 
The extra energy of motion is in fact &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo; for conversion into mass. 
If a particle loses energy, it also loses momentum.  
Momentum conservation therefore prohibits the conversion of all of the energy into mass. 
It turns out that momentum and energy conservation taken together forbid uphill decays into heavier particles no matter how fast the initial particle might be moving. 


If two particles collide, on the other hand, some&emdash;but not all&emdash;of their energy of motion is available to create mass. 
It is in this way that the various unstable particles are manufactured in the laboratory. 
In an actual typical collision in the vicinity of an accelerator, one of the two particles, the projectile, is moving rapidly, and the other, the target, is at rest. 
Under these conditions, the requirement that the final particles should have as much momentum as the initial projectile severely restricts the amount of energy that can be converted into mass. 
This is too bad, for the projectile has been given a great energy at a great expense. 
To make a proton-antiproton pair, for example, by the projectile-hitting-fixed-target method, the projectile must have a kinetic energy of \SI{6}{\giga\eV} (billion electron volts), of which only \SI{2}{\giga\eV} goes into making the mass. 
The \SI{6}{\giga\eV} Berkeley Bevatron was designed with this fact in mind in order to be able to make antiprotons and antineutrons. 
Typical processes for protons striking protons are: 

\begin{align*}
    p + p &\longrightarrow  p + p + p + \bar{p} , 
    p + p &\longrightarrow  p + p + n + \bar{n} , 
\end{align*}

The unfortunate waste of \SI{4}{\giga\eV} in these processes could be avoided if the target proton were not quiescent, but flew at the projectile with equal and opposite speed. 
It is hard enough to produce one high-energy beam, and far more difficult to produce two at once. 
Nevertheless, the gain in available energy makes it worth the trouble, and a technique for producing &ldquo;clashing beams&rdquo; is now employed at Stanford University, where oppositely directed beams of electrons collide. 
The device is sometimes called by physicists the synchroclash. 


Momentum is purely a property of motion&emdash;that is, if there is no motion, there is no momentum. 
It is somewhat trickier than energy, for momentum is what is called a vector quantity. 
It has direction as well as magnitude. 
Vectors are actually familiar in everyday life, whether or not we know them by that name. 
The velocity of an automobile is a vector, with a magnitude (50 miles per hour, for example) and a direction (northbound, for example). 
Force is a vector, a push or pull of some strength in some direction. 
Mass, on the other hand, is not a vector. 
It points in no particular direction.  
Energy also has no direction. 
The momentum of a rolling freight car, however, is directed along the tracks, and the momentum of an elementary particle is directed along its course through space. 


In order to appreciate the law of momentum conservation, one must know how to add vectors. 
Two men pushing on a stalled car are engaged in adding vectors. 
If they push with equal strength and in the same direction, the total force exerted is twice the force each one exerts and, of course, in the direction they are pushing [Figure 4.1(a)]. 
If they push with equal strength but at opposite ends of the car, their effort comes to naught, for the sum of two vector quantities which are equal in strength but opposite in direction is zero [Figure 4.1(b)]. 
If they get on opposite sides of the car and push partly inward, partly forward, the net force exerted will be forward, but less than twice the force of each [Figure 4.1(c)]. 
Depending on their degree of co-operation, the two men may achieve a strength of force from zero up to twice the force each can exert. 
This is a general characteristic of the sum of two vectors. 
It may have a wide range of values depending on the orientation of the two vectors.

    The forces exerted by two men pushing equally hard may be &ldquo;added,&rdquo; that is, combined, to give any total from zero up to twice the force of each.

Consider the law of momentum conservation applied to the decay of a kaon into muon and neutrino. 

\begin{equation*}
    K^+ \longrightarrow \mu^+ + \nu_{\mu} .
\end{equation*}

Before the decay, suppose the kaon is at rest [Figure 4.2(a)]. 
After the decay, momentum conservation requires that muon and neutrino fly off with equal magnitudes of momenta and and that the momenta 


<figure>
\label{fig:4.2}
\caption{
    Momentum conservation in kaon decay. 
    The total momentum is zero both before and after the decay. 
}
</figure>

be oppositely directed [Figure 4.2(b)]. 
Only in this way can the vector sum of the two final momenta be equal to the original momentum, namely zero. 
This type of decay, called a two-body decay, is rather common, and is always characterized by particles emerging in exactly opposite directions. 


In a three-body decay, the emerging particles have more freedom. 
Figure 1.8, for example, shows the decay of a kaon into three pions with the tracks pointing in three different directions. 
Recalling the analogy between momentum and force, one can visualize a situation in which three different forces are acting and producing no net effect&emdash;two fighters and a referee all pushing in different directions in a clinch. 
Similarly, the momentum vectors must adjust themselves to produce no net effect; that is, they must add up to give zero. 
Momentum conservation on a grander scale is shown in Figure 4.3, where eight particles emerge from a single event. 


One vital prohibition of the law of momentum conservation is that against one-body decays. 
Consider, for example, this possibility, 

\begin{equation*}
    K^+ \longrightarrow \pi^+ ,
\end{equation*}

the transformation of kaon to pion. 
It satisfies the laws of charge and family-number conservation. 
It is consistent with energy conservation, for it is downhill in mass, and it also satisfies spin conservation. But the kaon-pion mass difference must get converted to energy of motion, so that if the kaon was at rest, the pion will fly away. 
In whatever direction it moves, it has some momentum and therefore violates momentum conservation, since the kaon had none. 
On the other hand, if we enforce the law of momentum conservation, and keep the pion at rest, we shall have violated energy conservation, for in this case the extra energy arising from the mass difference will be unaccounted for. 


Angular momentum, a measure of the strength of rotational motion, has been a key concept in physics since the time of Kepler. 
Actually, Kepler did not recognize it as such, but the second of his three laws of planetary motion&emdash;the so-called law of areas&emdash;is equivalent to a law of conservation of angular momentum. 
According to this law, an imaginary straight line drawn from the earth to the sun sweeps out area in space at a constant rate. 
During a single day this line sweeps across a thin triangular region with apex at the sun and base along the earth&#39;s orbit. 
The area of this triangle is the same for every day of the year. 
So, when the earth is closer to the sun, it must move faster in order to define a triangle with the same area. 
It speeds up just enough, in fact, to maintain a constant value of its angular momentum, and the law of areas can be derived as a simple consequence of the law of conservation of angular momentum (this was first done by Newton). 


The earth also serves to illustrate approximately the two kinds of angular momentum which enter into the conservation law&emdash;orbital and spin. 
The earth possesses angular momentum because of its orbital motion round the sun and because of its daily (spin) rotation about its own axis. 
For an elementary particle, the notion of spin is about the same as for the earth&emdash;rotational motion about an axis.

If a photographer in space took a time exposure of the earth and sun, his photograph would contain a short blur for the sun and a longer blur for the earth. 
He would notice that the blurs were not directed toward each other, and from this fact alone could conclude that earth and sun possess relative angular momentum. 
He would not need to know whether the earth swings around the sun or whether it proceeds into interstellar space. 
The key fact defining orbital angular momentum is some transverse motion of two objects. Any two moving objects, not aimed directly at each other, possess relative angular momentum. 
Two trains passing on the great plains have relative angular momentum, even though each is proceeding straight as an arrow. 
But if, through some mischance, both were on the same track on a collision course, they would have zero angular momentum. 
In particle collisions and decays, orbital angular momentum is usually of this trains-in-the-plains type, not involving actual orbiting of one particle round another. 
Figure 4.4 illustrates several examples of motion with angular momentum. 


Angular momentum is a vector quantity. 
Its direction is taken to be the axis of rotation. 
The axis is well defined for spin, but what about orbital motion? 
For the passing trains, imagine again the blurred photograph indicating their direction of motion. 
Then ask: What would the axis be if the trains rotated about each other, instead of proceeding onward? 
The answer is a vertical axis; the angular momentum is directed upward. 
One more fact about orbital angular momentum needs to be known. Unlike spin, which comes in units of $\frac{1}{2}\hbar$, it comes only in units of $\hbar$. 


The spinless pion decays into muon and neutrino, each with spin $\frac{1}{2}$.
In Figure 4.5 we use artistic license and represent the particles by little spheres with arrows to indicate their direction of spin. 
Muon and neutrino spin oppositely in order to preserve the total zero angular momentum. 
In this case, no orbital angular momentum is involved.

Another two-body decay, that of the $\Lambda$, illustrates the coupling of spin and orbital motion. 
The $\Lambda$, supposed initially at rest [Figure 4.6(a)], has spin $\frac{1}{2}$.
One of its possible decay modes is 

\begin{equation*}
    \Lambda^0 \longrightarrow p + \pi^- .
\end{equation*}

This may proceed in two ways. 
The proton and pion may move apart with no orbital angular momentum, the proton spin directed upward to match the initial $\Lambda$ spin [Figure 4.6(b)]; or the proton spin may be flipped to point downward while proton and pion

separate with one unit of orbital angular momentum, directed upward [Figure 4.6(c)]. 
In the first case,

\begin{equation*}
    \text{original spin $\frac{1}{2}$ (up) $\longrightarrow$ final spin $\frac{1}{2}$ (down)}  .
\end{equation*}

In the second case, 

\begin{equation*}
    \text{original spin $\frac{1}{2}$ (up) $\longrightarrow$ final spin $\frac{1}{2}$ (down) + orbital angular momentum 1 (up)} . 
\end{equation*}


Beta decay, the earliest known particle decay process, serves 
nicely to illustrate all of the absolute conservation laws discussed. 
The beta decay of the neutron, indicated symbolically by 

\begin{equation*}
    n \longrightarrow p + e^- + \bar{\nu_{e}} , 
\end{equation*}


is pictured in Figure 4.7. 
Consider now the conservation laws applied to this decay. 


<em>Energy</em>. Reference to Table 1 shows that the sum of the masses 
of the proton (1836.12), the electron (1.0), and the electron&#39;s neutrino (<span class="math">0</span>), add up to less than the neutron mass (\num{1838.65}). 
The decay is therefore an allowed downhill decay, the slight excess mass going into kinetic energy of the products.

    The direction of angular momentum is defined by the right-hand rule. 
    If the curved fingers of the right hand point in the direction of rotational motion, the right thumb defines the direction assigned to the angular momentum. 
    Thus the particle spin is up in diagrams (a) and (b) and down in diagram (c); the orbital angular momentum is up in diagram (c). 
}

<em>Momentum</em>.
The three particles must fan off in different directions with the available excess energy so distributed among them that the sum of the three momentum vectors is zero. 

<em>Angular momentum</em>.
One possibility, illustrated in Figure 4.7, is that the departing electron and proton have opposite cancelling spins, while the neutrino spins in the same direction as the original neutron to conserve the angular momentum. 


<em>Charge</em>.
The final charge (1 positive, 1 negative, 1 neutral) is zero, the same as the initial neutron charge.

<em>Electron-family number</em>.
The neutron has zero electron- family number. 
In the decay, one electron and one antineutrino ($\bar{v_e}$) are created to preserve zero electron-family number. 

<em>Muon-family number</em>.
No members of the muon family are created or destroyed. 


<em>Baryon number</em>.
The proton is the single baryon among the final three particles, matching the single original baryon. 


Now we propose an exercise for the reader. 
Below are listed a few decays and transformations which do not occur in nature. 
If only one particle stands on the left, a decay process is understood. 
If two particles stand on the left, a collision process is understood. 
At least one conservation law prohibits each of these processes. 
Find at least one conservation law violated by each process. 
Several violate more than one law and one of those listed violates five of the seven conservation laws. 

\begin{align*}
    \mu^+ &\longrightarrow \pi^+ + \nu_{\mu}  \\

    e^- &\longrightarrow \nu_e + \gamma  \\

    p + p &\longrightarrow p + \Lambda^0 + \Sigma^+ \\

    \mu^+ &\longrightarrow \Lambda^0  \\

    n &\longrightarrow \mu^+  e^- + \gamma \\

    \Lambda^0 &\longrightarrow p +  e^-a \\

    \pi^- + p &\longrightarrow \pi^- + n + \Lambda^0 + K^+ \\

    e^+ + e^- &\longrightarrow \mu^+ + \pi^- \\

    \mu^- &\longrightarrow e^- + e^+ + \nu_{\mu} \\

\end{align*}

The aspect of conservation laws that makes them appear to the theorist and the philosopher to be the most beautiful and profound statements of natural law is their connection with principles of symmetry in nature. 
Baldly stated, energy, momentum, and angular momentum are all conserved because space and time are isotropic (the same in every direction) and homogeneous (the same at every place). 
This is a breath-taking statement when one reflects upon it, for it says that three of the seven absolute conservation laws arise solely because empty space has no distinguishing characteristics, and is everywhere equally empty and equally undistinguished. 
(Because of the relativistic link between space and time, we really mean space-time.) 
It seems, in the truest sense, that we are getting something from nothing. 


Yet there can be no doubt about the connection between the properties of empty space and the fundamental conservation laws which govern elementary-particle behavior. 
This connection raises philosophical questions which we will mention but not pursue at any length. 
On the one hand, it may be interpreted to mean that conservation laws, being based on the most elementary and intuitive ideas, are the most profound statements of natural law. 
On the other hand, one may argue, as Bertrand Russell
\footnote{
    Bertrand Russell, The ABC of Relativity (New York: New American Library, 1959). 
}
has done, that it only demonstrates the hollowness of conservation laws (&ldquo;truisms,&rdquo; according to Russell), energy, momentum, and angular momentum all being defined in just such a way that they must be conserved. 
Now, in fact, it is not inconsistent to hold both views at once. 
If the aim of science is the self-consistent description of natural phenomena based upon the simplest set of basic assumptions, what could be more satisfying than to have basic assumptions so completely elementary and self-evident (the uniformity of space-time) that the laws derived from them can be called truisms? 
Since the scientist generally is inclined to call most profound that which is most simple and most general, he is not above calling a truism profound. 
Speaking more pragmatically, we must recognize the discovery of anything that is absolutely conserved as something of an achievement, regardless of the arbitrariness of definition involved. 
Looking at those conservation laws whose basis we do not understand (the three family-number-conservation laws) also brings home the fact that it is easier to call a conservation law a truism after it is understood than before. 
It seems quite likely that we shall gain a deeper understanding of nature and of natural laws before the conservation of baryon number appears to anyone to be a self-evident truth. 


Before trying to clarify through simple examples the connection between conservation laws and the uniformity of space, we consider the question, &ldquo;What is symmetry?&rdquo; 
In most general terms, symmetry means that when one thing (A) is changed in some particular way, something else (B) remains unchanged. 
A symmetrical face is one whose appearance (B) would remain the same if its two sides (A) were interchanged. 
If a square figure (A) is rotated through 90 degrees, its appearance (B) is not changed. 
Among plane figures, the circle is the most symmetrical, for if it is rotated about its center through any angle whatever, it remains indistinguishable from the original circle&emdash;or, in the language of modern physics, its form remains invariant. 
In the language of ancient Greece, the circle is the most perfect and most beautiful of plane figures. 


Aristotle regarded the motion of the celestial bodies as necessarily circular because of the perfection (the symmetry) of the circle. 
Now, from a still deeper symmetry of space-time, we can derive the ellipses of Kepler. 
Modem science, which could begin only after breaking loose from the centuries-old hold of Aristotelian physics, now finds itself with an unexpected Aristotelian flavor, coming both from the increasingly dominant role of symmetry principles and from the increasingly geometrical basis of physics. 


We are accustomed to think of symmetry in spatial terms. 
The symmetry of the circle, the square, and the face are associated with rotations or inversions in space. 
Symmetry in time is an obvious extension of spatial symmetry; the fact that nature&#39;s laws appear to remain unchanged as time passes is a fundamental symmetry of nature. 
However, there exist some subtler symmetries, and it is reasonable to guess that the understanding of baryon conservation, for example, will come through the discovery of new symmetries not directly connected with space and time. 


In the symmetry of interest to the scientist, the unchanging thing&emdash;the invariant element&emdash;is the form of natural laws. 
The thing changed may be orientation in space, or position in space or time, or some more abstract change (not necessarily realizable in practice) such as the interchange of two particles. 
The inversion of space and the reversal of the direction of flow of time are other examples of changes not realizable in practice, but nonetheless of interest for the symmetries of natural law. 
These latter two will be discussed in Chapter Eight. 


If scientists in Chicago, New York, and Geneva perform the same experiment and get the same answer (within experimental error) they are demonstrating one of the symmetries of nature, the homogeneity of space. 
If the experiment is repeated later with the same result, no one is surprised, for we have come to accept the homogeneity of time. 
The laws of nature are the same, so far as we know, at all points in space, and for all times. 
This invariance is important and is related to the laws of conservation of energy and momentum, but ordinary experience conditions us to expect such invariance so that it seems at first to be trivial or self-evident. 
It might seem hard to visualize any science at all if natural law changed from place to place and time to time, but, in fact, quantitative science would be perfectly possible without the homogeneity of space-time. 
Imagine yourself, for example, on a merry-go-round that speeded up and slowed down according to a regular schedule. 
If you carried out experiments to deduce the laws of mechanics and had no way of knowing that you were on a rotating system, you would conclude that falling balls were governed by laws which varied with time and with position (distance from central axis), but you would be quite able to work out the laws in detail and predict accurately the results of future experiments, provided you knew where and when the experiment was to be carried out. 
Thanks to the actual homogeneity of space and time, the results of future experiments can in fact be predicted without any knowledge of the where or when. 


A slightly less obvious kind of invariance, although one also familiar from ordinary experience, is the invariance of the laws of nature for systems in uniform motion. 
Passengers on an ideally smooth train or in an ideally smooth elevator are unaware of motion. 
If the laws of mechanics were significantly altered, the riders would be aware of it through unusual bodily sensations. 
Such a qualitative guide is, of course, not entirely reliable, but careful experiments performed inside the ideal uniformly moving train would reveal the same laws of nature revealed by corresponding experiments conducted in a stationary laboratory. 
This particular invariance underlies the theory of relativity, and is a manifestation of the isotropy of four-dimensional space-time, a point we can regrettably not discuss in detail. 
What, to our limited three-dimensional vision, appears to be uniform motion is, to a more enlightened brain capable of encompassing four dimensions, merely a rotation. 
Instead of turning, say, from north to east, the experimenter who climbs aboard the train is, from the more general view, turning from space partly toward the time direction. 
According to relativity, which joins space and time together in a four-dimensional space-time, the laws of nature should no more be changed by &ldquo;turning&rdquo; experimental apparatus toward the time direction (that is, loading it aboard the train) than by turning it through 90 degrees in the laboratory. 


The chain of connection we have been discussing is: Symmetry $\longrightarrow$ invariance $\longrightarrow$ conservation. 
The symmetry of space and time, or possibly some subtler symmetry of nature, implies the invariance of physical laws under certain changes associated with the symmetry. 
In the simplest case, for example, the symmetry of space which we call its homogeneity implies the invariance of experimental results when the apparatus is moved from one place to another. 
This invariance, in turn, implies the existence of certain conservation laws. 
The relation between conservation laws and symmetry principles is what we now wish to illuminate through two examples. 
Unfortunately, an adequate discussion of this important connection requires the use of mathematics beyond the scope of this book. 


Suppose we imagine a single isolated hydrogen atom alone and at rest in empty space. 
If we could draw up a chair and observe it without influencing it, what should we expect to see? 
(For this discussion, we ignore quantum mechanics and the wave nature of particles, pretending that electron and proton may be separately seen as particles, and be uninfluenced by the observer. 
The reader will have to accept the fact that these false assumptions are permissible and irrelevant for the present discussion.) 
We should see an electron in rapid motion circling about a proton, and the proton itself moving more slowly in a smaller circle. 
Were we to back off until the whole atom could only be discerned as a single spot, that spot, if initially motionless, would remain at rest forever. 
We now must ask whether this circumstance is significant or insignificant, important or dull. 
It certainly does not seem surprising. 
Why should the atom move, we may ask. 
It is isolated from the rest of the universe, no forces act upon it from outside, therefore there is nothing to set it into motion. 
If we leave a book on a table and come back later, we expect to find it there. 
Everyday experience conditions us to expect that an object on which no external forces act will not spontaneously set itself into motion. 
There is no more reason for the atom to begin to move than for the book to migrate across the table and fly into a corner. 
The trouble with this argument is that it makes use of the common sense of ordinary experience, without offering any explanation for the ordinary experience. 


If we put aside &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; and ask what the atom might do, it is by no means obvious that it should remain at rest. 
In spite of the fact that no external forces are acting, strong internal forces are at work. 
The proton exerts a force on the electron which constantly alters its motion; the electron, in turn, exerts a force on the proton. 
Both atomic constituents are experiencing force. 
Why should these forces not combine to set the atom as a whole into motion? 
Having put the question in this way, we may consider the book on the table again. 
It consists of countless billions of atoms, each one exerting forces on its neighboring atoms. 
Through what miracle do these forces so precisely cancel out that no net force acts upon the book as a whole and it remains quiescent on the table? 


The classical approach to this problem is to look for a positive, or permissive, law, a law which tells what does happen. 
Newton first enunciated this law which (except for some modification made necessary by the theory of relativity) has withstood the test of time to the present day. 
It is called Newton&#39;s third law, and says that all forces in nature occur in equal and opposite balanced pairs. 
The proton&#39;s force on the electron is exactly equal and opposite to the electron&#39;s force on the proton. 
The sum of these two forces (the vector sum) is zero, so that there is no tendency for the structure as a whole to move in any direction. 
The balancing of forces, moreover, can be related to a balancing of momenta. 
By making use of Newton&#39;s second law,
\footnote{
    Newton&#39;s second law, usually written $F=ma$, says that the acceleration a experienced by a particle multiplied by its mass <span class="math">m</span> is equal to the force <span class="math">F</span> acting upon it. 
    The law may also be stated in this way: The rate at which the momentum of a particle is changing is equal to the force applied. 
}
which relates the motion to the force, one can discover that, in a hydrogen atom initially at rest, the balanced forces will cause the momenta of electron and proton to be equal and opposite. 
At a given instant, the two particles are moving in opposite directions. 
The heavier proton moves more slowly, but has the same momentum as the electron. 
As the electron swings to a new direction and a new speed in its track, the proton swings too in just such a way that its momentum remains equal and opposite to that of the electron. 
In spite of the continuously changing momenta of the two particles, the total momentum of the atom remains zero; the atom does not move. In this way&emdash;by &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; and applying two laws, Newton&#39;s second and third laws of motion&emdash;one derives the law of momentum conservation and finds an explanation of the fact that an isolated atom does not move.

Without difficulty, the same arguments may be applied to the book on the table. 
Since all forces come in equal and opposite pairs, the forces between every pair of atoms cancel, so that the total force is zero, no matter how many billions of billions of atoms and individual forces there might be. 


It is worth reviewing the steps in the argument above. 
Two laws of permission were discovered, telling what does happen. 
One law relates the motion to the force; the other says that the forces between pairs of particles are always equal and opposite. 
From these laws, the conservation of momentum was derived as an interesting consequence, and this conservation law in turn explained the fact that an isolated atom at rest remains at rest. 


The modern approach to the problem starts in quite a different way, by seeking a law of prohibition, a principle explaining why the atom does not move. 
This principle is the invariance of laws of nature to a change of position. 
Recall the chain of key ideas referred to on page 105: symmetry $\longrightarrow$ invariance $\longrightarrow$ conservation. 
In the example of the isolated hydrogen atom, the symmetry of interest is the homogeneity of space. 
Founded upon this symmetry is the invariance principle just cited. 
Finally, the conservation law resting on this invariance principle is the conservation of momentum. 


In order to clarify, through the example of the hydrogen atom, the connecting links between the assumed homogeneity of space and the conservation of momentum, we must begin with an exact statement of the invariance principle as applied to our isolated atom.  
The principle is this: No aspect of the motion of an isolated atom depends upon the location of the center of mass of the atom. 
The center of mass of any object is the average position of all of the mass in the object. 
In a hydrogen atom, the center of mass is a point in space between the electron and the proton, close to the more massive proton. 


Let us visualize our hydrogen atom isolated in empty space with its center of mass at rest. 
Suppose now that its center of mass starts to move. 
In which direction should it move? 
We confront at once the question of the homogeneity of space. 
Investing our atom with human qualities for a moment, we can say that it has no basis upon which to &ldquo;decide&rdquo; how to move. 
To the atom surveying the possibilities, every direction is precisely as good or bad as every other direction. It is therefore frustrated in its &ldquo;desire&rdquo; to move and simply remains at rest. 


This anthropomorphic description of the situation can be replaced by sound mathematics. 
What the mathematics shows is that an acceleration of the center of mass&emdash;for example, changing from a state of rest to a state of motion&emdash;is not consistent with the assumption that the laws of motion of the atom are independent of the location of the center of mass. 
If the center of mass of the atom is initially at rest at point A and it then begins to move, it will later pass through another point B. 
At point A, the center of mass had no velocity. 
At point B it does have a velocity. 
Therefore, the state of motion of the atom depends on the location of the center of mass, contrary to the invariance principle. 
Only if the center of mass remains at rest can the atom satisfy the invariance principle.
\footnote{
    If the center of mass of the atom had been moving initially, the invariance principle requires that it continue moving with constant velocity. 
}
The immobility of the center of mass requires, in turn, that the two particles composing the atom have equal and opposite momenta. 
A continual balancing of the two momenta means that their sum, the total momentum, is a constant. 


The argument thus proceeds directly from the symmetry principle to the conservation law without making use of Newton&#39;s laws of motion. 
That this is a deeper approach to conservation laws, as well as a more esthetically pleasing one, has been verified by history. 
Although Newton&#39;s laws of motion have been altered by relativity and by quantum mechanics, the direct connection between the symmetry of space and the conservation of momentum has been unaffected&emdash;or even strengthened&emdash;by these modern theories and momentum conservation remains one of the pillars of modern physics. 
We must recognize that a violation of the law of momentum conservation would imply an inhomogeneity of space; this is not an impossibility, but it would have far-reaching consequences for our view of the universe. 


Returning finally to the book on the table, we want to emphasize that the quiescence of the undisturbed book&emdash;a macroscopic object&emdash;at least strongly suggests that momentum conservation must be a valid law in the microscopic world. 
Viewed microscopically, the book is a collection of an enormous number of atoms, each one in motion. 
That this continuous microscopic motion never makes itself felt as spontaneous bulk motion of the whole book is true only because of the conservation of momentum which requires that every time an atom changes its momentum (as it is constantly doing) one or more other atoms must undergo exactly compensating changes of their momentum. 


Through similar examples it is possible to relate the law of conservation of angular momentum to the isotropy of space. 
A compass needle which is held pointing east and is then released will swing toward the north because of the action of the earth&#39;s magnetic field upon it. 
But if the same compass needle is taken to the depths of empty space, far removed from all external influences, and set to point in some direction, it will remain pointing in that direction. 
A swing in one direction or the other would imply a nonuniformity
\footnote{
    Strictly, momentum conservation rests on the homogeneity of space (uniformity of place), and angular momentum conservation rests on the isotropy of space (uniformity of direction). 
    The distinction is not important for our purposes, and it is satisfactory to think of space simply as everywhere the same, homogeneity and isotropy being summarized by the word uniformity.
}
of space. 
If the uniformity of space is adopted as a fundamental symmetry principle, it can be concluded that the total angular momentum of all the atomic constituents of the needle must be a constant. 
Otherwise, the internal motions within the needle could set the whole needle into spontaneous rotation and its motion would violate the symmetry principle. 


Energy conservation, in a way that is not so easy to see, is related to the homogeneity of time. 
Thus all three conservation laws&emdash;of energy, momentum, and angular momentum&emdash;are &ldquo;understood&rdquo; in terms of the symmetry of space-time, and indeed the theory of relativity has shown that these three laws are all parts of a single general conservation law in the four-dimensional world. 


Only one of the three conservation laws governing the intrinsic properties of the particles has so far been understood in terms of a symmetry principle. 
This is the law of charge conservation. (Recall, however, that the quantization of charge is not yet understood.) 
The symmetry principle underlying charge conservation is considerably more subtle than the space-time symmetry underlying the conservation laws of properties of motion. 
The modern version of this symmetry principle rests upon technical aspects of the theory of quantum mechanics (it may be based also on equally technical aspects of the theory of electromagnetism). 
Nevertheless, it is such a stunning victory for the power of a symmetry principle that we must try, however crudely, to indicate the modern view of this symmetry. 


In the main, the classical theories of physics deal directly with quantities which are measurable, usually called observables. 
Force, mass, velocity, and almost all the other concepts described by the classical laws are themselves observables. 
The equations of quantum mechanics, however, contain quantities which are not themselves observables. From these quantities&emdash;one step removed from reality&emdash;the observables are derived. 
The &ldquo;wave function&rdquo; is one of the unobservable quantities; it determines the probability, say, that the electron is at any particular point in the hydrogen atom, but is itself not that probability nor any other measurable thing. 
Now enters the idea of symmetry. 
Any change that can be made in the unobservable quantity without resulting in a change of the observables ought to leave all the laws of nature unchanged. 
After careful scrutiny, this statement seems so obviously true that it is hard to understand how it could have any important consequences. 
Of course one ought to be able to do anything whatever to unobservable quantities so long as observables are not changed. 
But remember how important were the properties of empty space. 
Equally important are the properties of unobservables such as wave functions. 


Space itself may be regarded as an unobservable. 
The uniformity of space means that it is impossible, by any experimental means, to ascertain one&#39;s absolute position in space. 
An experiment carried out at one place will yield results identical to the results of the same experiment carried out at another place. 
Any change in the unobservable space (for instance, moving the apparatus from one place to another) must leave unchanged the laws of nature and the observable results of experiment. 
As we have just seen, this symmetry principle or invariance requirement underlies the law of momentum conservation. 


When an analogous symmetry principle is applied to the unobservable wave function of the electron a conservation law results, the conservation of charge. 
Expressed negatively, if charge were not conserved, the form of the equations of quantum mechanics would depend upon unobservable quantities, a situation at variance with our symmetry principle. 
The analogous statement for spatial homogeneity would be: If momentum were not conserved, the laws of mechanics would depend upon the absolute location in space and such dependence is at variance with the assumed symmetry of space. 


Regrettably, we can not explain the law of charge conservation more fully without mathematics. 
It is expected, but not yet verified, that some undiscovered subtle symmetries of nature underlie the laws of electron-family conservation, muon-family conservation, and baryon conservation. 
The absolute prohibition of proton decay, which keeps its enormous intrinsic energy locked forever in the form of mass, can be no accident, but the reason still remains hidden.
