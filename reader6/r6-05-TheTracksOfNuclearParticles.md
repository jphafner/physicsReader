A nuclear physicist studying the elementary particles of nature is in much the same position as an explorer trying to picture unknown animals from their tracks. 
The physicist never can see the particles themselves&emdash;only their footprints in a cloud chamber or a photographic plate. 
But from these tracks he deduces a particle&#39;s mass, movements, speed, lifetime and social impact on its fellows. 
By now the tracks of some members of the nuclear family are almost as familiar and readable as the footprints of a domestic animal. 
Interesting new tracks keep turning up, some strange, some predictable&emdash;the latest to make its appearance is that of the long-sought antiproton. 
It seems a timely moment to survey the scene and review the gallery of footprints that identify the members of the strange population in the nucleus of the atom. 


We shall consider the tracks as they are recorded in photographic emulsions. 
It was in this medium that the existence of particles in the nucleus of the atom was first detected&emdash;through the fact that Henri Becquerel left some uranium near photographic film in a drawer. 
Becquerel noted simply that radioactive emanations from the uranium had fogged his film. 
That the &ldquo;fog&rdquo; might consist of a network of tracks was not discovered until 13 years later. 
In 1909 Otto Mugge of Germany exposed some film to tiny crystals of zircon, a feebly radioactive mineral. 
To study the faintly developed image he had to use a microscope, and he then noticed that there were fine linear tracks radiating from the crystals. 
Not long afterward the tracks of alpha particles emitted by radium were recorded in fine grained emulsions at Lord Rutherford&#39;s famous laboratory in England. 


When a charged particle travels through a photographic emulsion, it forms a latent image in the silver bromide grains, just as light does. 
In the case of the moving particle, the latent image results from ionization by the particle along its path. 
This image, marking the track of the particle, is then made visible by development of the emulsion in the usual way. 
So that fast particles may be brought to a stop within the emulsion, it is usually made as thick as possible. 
Emulsions used to track cosmic rays and high-energy particles from accelerators are often more than one millimeter thick&emdash;about 100 times thicker than in ordinary photographic film. 
The length of a particle&#39;s track in the emulsion must be measured precisely to determine its kinetic energy. 
Since the path slants into the emulsion, its length cannot be measured directly: it is computed by means of the Pythagorean theorem from the two measurable distances&emdash;the depth at which the particle comes to rest in the emulsion and the horizontal distance along the emulsion surface from the point of entry to the point directly above the end of the track. 


At best the search for particle tracks in emulsions is slow, tedious work. 
It takes many hours or days of poring over the photographic plate with a microscope to find and trace the faint lines of silver grains. 
For this reason physicists long preferred to use cloud chambers for particle detection work. 
But the photographic plate has an obvious advantage over a cloud chamber. 
Particles traveling through this denser medium are more likely to collide with atomic nuclei and produce interesting developments. 
A great deal of work has been done to improve nuclear emulsions. 
In 1947 Pierre Demers of the University of Montreal found a way to prepare stable emulsions containing 90 per cent silver bromide, instead of the usual 30 per cent, and in these more concentrated emulsions particles produce more robust tracks.


Let us proceed to examine some of the identifying tracks. 
We shall begin by immersing a photographic plate in a very dilute solution of a soluble compound of the radioactive element radium. 
After leaving it for a time (days, weeks or months) in a dark place, we remove the plate, develop it and inspect it under a microscope. 
Here and there on the plate we see starlike sets of short heavy tracks, each set radiating like spokes from a hub point. 
The tracks identify the particles as slow alpha particles, and the formation is known as an alpha star. 
At the center of the star a radium atom has emitted a series of alpha particles. 
The radium atom decays first to radon, then to other unstable descendants and finally to lead. 
In this spontaneous transmutation from radium to lead a total of five alpha particles (plus several beta particles) is emitted. 
Each in the series comes out with a characteristic kinetic energy, and the different energies (ranging up to 7.7 million electron volts) cause the tracks in a star to be of different lengths.


Occasionally the star seen in a photographic plate may represent the disintegration of not one but many radium atoms. 
This was made clear by an experiment performed by Mile. C. Chamie at the Curie Institute in Paris. 
She exposed a plate in an extremely dilute solution of polonium, the last alpha-emitting descendant of radium in the transition to lead. 
It was supposed that single tracks of alpha particles, from separate atoms of polonium, would appear in the emulsion. 
Instead Mile. C. Chamie found stars consisting of several hundred alpha tracks from a common center. 
All the tracks were of the same length, corresponding to the energy of alpha-emission from polonium. 
Evidently even in an extremely dilute solution the polonium atoms are not completely dissociated into individual ions but may cluster in groups of several thousand atoms. 
The collections have been named radiocolloids. 


All matter contains traces of radioactive substances, and their energy fields have been pulsating in minerals since the earth&#39;s crust solidified eons ago. 
Nature strews the investigator&#39;s path with clues&emdash;if we could only see. 
Long before the discovery of radioactivity, geologists had observed that grains in certain minerals, such as mica, were sometimes surrounded with halos of colored material. 
They could find no way to explain how these colored bands might be formed. 
In 1907, when radioactivity was a topic of growing interest, John Joly in Ireland noted that the distance from the center of each tiny sphere to the halo around it was about the same as the range of an alpha particle emitted by radium or thorium. 
He suggested what is now taken to be the correct solution of the mystery: that alpha particles radiating from radioactive atoms at the center ionize iron atoms in the mica near the end of their path, cause the iron to become oxidized and thereby produce the colored bands. 


Just as familiar, and as ubiquitous, as the footprints of alpha particles are the footprints of beta particles, or electrons. 
These light particles make very faint, highly scattered tracks in an emulsion. 
Originating from radioactive substances and from cosmic ray showers, flying electrons record their presence in emulsions wherever placed or however carefully shielded. 
Even at great depths underground a photographic plate will show about one million electron tracks per cubic centimeter for each day of its underground exposure. 


No footprints are more fascinating than those of the strange particles known as mesons. 
Had present emulsions been in use in the 1920s, their tracks would have been discovered first and &ldquo;explained&rdquo; afterward; as it was, the particles were predicted by the theoretician Hideki Yukawa two years before they were actually found. 
Yukawa invented the meson to account for the binding force that holds particles together in the atomic nucleus. 
Tracks of a particle such as he had predicted&emdash;about 200 times heavier than the electron&emdash;were first discovered in 1937 in cloud chambers monitoring the products of cosmic rays. 
A mystery soon developed: the theory said that these particles should interact strongly with atomic nuclei, but experiments proved that they were rarely absorbed by nuclei.

While the theoreticians were pondering this hiatus between theory and experiment, the younger physicists were busy climbing mountains and exposing photographic plates to the intense cosmic radiation high in the atmosphere. 
By 1947 they had discovered a second, heavier meson which did react strongly with matter [see &ldquo;The Multiplicity of Particles,&rdquo; by Robert E. Marshak; <em>Scientific American</em>, January, 1952]. 
A Bristol University team of investigators headed by C. F. Powell obtained photographs showing that when the heavy pi meson came to rest it promptly decayed into the lighter mu meson. 


A year later the young Brazilian C. M. G. Lattes, a member of the Bristol cosmic ray group, came to the University of California and in cooperation with Eugene Gardner succeeded in detecting mesons from nuclei attacked by a 400-million-electron-volt beam of alpha particles from the Berkeley cyclotron. 
Two types of pi meson tracks were then identified. 
Positively charged pi mesons decayed into mu mesons. 
Negatively charged pi mesons reacted with atomic nuclei, and the disintegration of the capturing nucleus produced a star. 


Meanwhile the European investigators, lacking funds for the construction of expensive accelerators, continued to study mesons in the cosmic radiation&emdash;the poor man&#39;s cyclotron. 
These simple experiments gave birth to a perplexing number of new particles. 


Their first addition to the growing fraternity of Greek-lettered mesons was the tau particle. 
The Bristol University investigators found its track in an electron-sensitive plate exposed beneath a 12-inch-thick block of lead at the Jung-fraujoch High Altitude Research Station. 
The particle, heavier than a pi meson, produced an unusual three-pronged star on coming to rest. 
All three prongs could be identified as the tracks of pi mesons. 
From the available evidence Powell came to the conclusion that the tau meson was an unstable, singly charged particle about 1,000 times heavier than the electron. 
Powell&#39;s brilliant deductions tempt one to finish off his description with the admiring exclamation: &ldquo;A new particle&emdash;elementary, my dear Watson!&rdquo; 


The heavy tau meson is very rare, but an extensive vigil has now detected a number of these events and established the particle&#39;s properties. 
Recent controlled experiments with the six-billion-electron-volt Bevatron at Berkeley indicate that the tau particle and certain other heavy mesons (known as K mesons) probably are all the same particle showing alternate modes of decay.

Neutral particles unfortunately leave no footprints in an emulsion or cloud chamber. 
They may, however, signal their presence indirectly. 
For example, a fast neutron charging through an emulsion may collide head on with a hydrogen atom, rip away the latter&#39;s electron and cause the proton to recoil and make a track that tells the story of the collision. 


At Berkeley all eyes are focused just now on the footprints of the antiproton, which at long last was generated by the Bevatron a few months ago. 
The antiproton&emdash;the negatively charged counterpart of the positive proton&emdash;has only a fleeting life, but it makes its existence unmistakably known by the spectacular manner of its death. 
When the particle comes to rest in an emulsion, there is an explosion which generates a large star.

</figure>


The particles emerging from the explosion, among which are several pi mesons, have a large kinetic energy; the total energy released is about that predicted by the theory that the antiproton and a proton combine and annihilate each other, converting mass into energy. 
The Bevatron produces antiprotons when a beam of high-energy protons (at 6.2 billion electron volts) hits a copper target. 
The fast protons attacking the nuclei of the copper atoms generate large numbers of heavy mesons and an occasional antiproton: the yield is about one antiproton per 62,000 mesons. 
The theory suggests that a high-energy proton interacts with a neutron to form an antiproton-proton pair.

The antiproton has the same mass as a proton. 
One would therefore expect that it should have about the same probability of collision with atomic nuclei as it travels through matter.
But experiments with the new particle show that the antiproton actually has about twice as great a collision probability, or cross section, as the proton. 
This surprising property has presented nuclear physicists with an intriguing problem. 


Enlightening as the work with atomsmashing machines has been, the investigators of particles have not by any means lost interest in the wild assortment of nuclei and nuclear debris that rains into our atmosphere from the bombardment of the cosmic radiation. 
Of the primary cosmic radiation itself, little reaches ground level, for the atmosphere absorbs it as effectively as would a three-foot-thick layer of lead completely surrounding the earth. 
But physicists are capturing the footprints of primary particles coming in from space by floating their instruments and photographic plates to the top of the air ocean in balloons. Great impetus was given to this work by the U. S. Navy&#39;s development of the plastic &ldquo;Skyhook&rdquo; balloon. 
Unlike nibber balloons, the plastic vehicles can be held at a fixed, preset elevation. 
Stacks of emulsions have been flown to 100,000 feet&emdash;almost at the borders of empty space, for the weight of the overlying air there is only 13 grams per square centimeter, as against 1,030 grams at sea level. 


As the primary cosmic rays smash nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the air, they generate a fallout of secondary and tertiary particles. 
The footprints of these fragments are being recorded at mountaintop stations all over the world. 
Men who risk their lives to climb a mountain simply &ldquo;because it is there&rdquo; are usually very cooperative with the cosmic ray physicists. 
A light package of photographic plates does not add appreciably to the burden of the climb, and it may add incentive as a form of applied mountaineering. 
In the ascent of Mt. Everest Sir Edmund Hillary took a small package of plates (given him by Professor Eugster of Zurich University) to the 25,850 foot camp site. 
Unfortunately, in the excitement of the triumphant descent from the peak the plates were overlooked. 
Sir John Hunt, the leader of the expedition, apologized in his book. 
The Conquest of Everest: &ldquo;I very much regret to say that the plates have remained on the South Col, where they must by now have made a very definite recording of &hellip; cosmic ray phenomena.&rdquo;

Among the first to get a recording of these phenomena was Marietta Blau of the University of Vienna. 
Nineteen years ago she exposed a series of photographic plates for four months on a mountaintop at Innsbruck. 
When she developed them, she found not only the familiar alpha stars from radioactive substances but also a number of bigger stars with much longer, less dense prongs. 
The tracks evidently were produced chiefly by protons. Dr. Blau surmised correctly that they were the debris of nuclei disrupted by cosmic rays; she followed up this finding and today is studying nuclear disruptions produced by the Cosmotron at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. 


The smashing of nuclei by cosmic rays increases rapidly with altitude. 
At sea level in northern latitudes the rate of star production in photographic plates is about one per cubic centimeter of emulsion per day of exposure; at 14,260 feet on Mt. Evans in Colorado the rate is 20 times that; and in balloons near the top of the atmosphere, 2,500 times. 
The tracks of the primary cosmic particles that arrive there from space are often extremely robust. 
These thick tracks are made by heavy nuclei, much larger than the nuclei of hydrogen atoms. 
The track is covered with a fur of spurs projecting from its sides&emdash;secondary ionizations which are known as delta rays. 
Since the amount of ionization by a particle along its path is proportional to the square of its charge, the amount of delta-ray ionization identifies the particle. 
The primary cosmic particles have been found to include the nuclei of almost all the elements from hydrogen to nickel. 
Iron nuclei often produce tracks heavy enough to be seen with the naked eye. 


Sometimes the incoming heavy nucleus is partly sheared off by a glancing collision in the air, and the separated bundles of nucleons diverge from the point of collision. 
Sometimes the cosmic primary hits an atom head on and disintegrates it, emitting a shower of heavy mesons: as many as 200 charged mesons have been seen in a single star. 
Many of the pi mesons decay during flight into mu mesons; the latter, nearly immune to capture by atoms, zip through the atmosphere and often plunge deep into the earth.

A small proportion of the heavy nuclei from space escape catastrophic collisions and are eventually slowed down by ionization processes in the atmosphere. 
When these particles are caught in an emulsion, they produce very spectacular tracks. 
The track is first thick and furry; then as the heavy nucleus slows down and begins to pick up electrons, the reduction of its positive charge diminishes the ionization it produces, so that its track tapers down to a needle point at the end of its flight. 


The last grain at the rest point of a heavy primary cosmic particle is a thing to marvel at. 
Embedded within the grain of silver in the emulsion is an atom with a history unlike that of its neighbors. 
It is an atom which may have been blown out of a star in our galaxy millions of years ago. 
It was accelerated through interstellar space by magnetohydrodynamic fields. 
For millions of years it escaped collision with cosmic dust. 
Finally it plowed into the earth&#39;s atmosphere, and in a single moment lost its store of energy accumulated since birth. 
Such is the ever-increasing entropy of the universe, of which Swinburne wrote: 

<blockquote>
We thank with brief thanksgiving 

Whatever gods may be  \\
That no man lives forever. \\ 
That dead men rise up never;  \\
That even the weariest river  \\

Winds somewhere safe to sea. 
</blockquote>
