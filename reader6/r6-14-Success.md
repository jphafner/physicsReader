Meanwhile Herbert Anderson and his group at the Met. Lab. had also been building small piles and gathering information for a larger pile from their behavior. 
The best place Compton had been able to find for work on the pile was a squash court under the West Stands of Stagg Field, the University of Chicago stadium. 
President Hutchins had banned football from the Chicago campus, and Stagg Field was used for odd purposes. 
To the west, on Ellis Avenue, the stadium is closed by a tall gray-stone structure in the guise of a medieval castle. 
Through a heavy portal is the entrance to the space beneath the West Stands. 
The Squash Court was part of this space. 
It was 30 feet wide, twice as long, and over 26 feet high. 


The physicists would have liked more space, but places better suited for the pile, which Professor Compton had hoped he could have, had been requisitioned by the expanding armed forces stationed in Chicago. 
The physicists were to be contented with the Squash Court, and there Herbert Anderson had started assembling piles. 
They were still &ldquo;small piles,&rdquo; because material flowed to the West Stands at a very slow, if steady, pace. 
As each new shipment of crates arrived, Herbert&#39;s spirits rose. 
He loved working and was of impatient temperament. 
His slender, almost delicate, body had unsuspected resilience and endurance. 
He could work at all hours and drive his associates to work along with his same intensity and enthusiasm. 


A shipment of crates arrived at the West Stands on a Saturday afternoon, when the hired men who would normally unpack them were not working. 
A university professor, older by several years than Herbert, gave a look at the crates and said lightly: &ldquo;Those fellows will unpack them Monday morning.&rdquo; 


&ldquo;Those fellows, Hell! We&#39;ll do them now,&rdquo; flared up Herbert, who had never felt inhibited in the presence of older men, higher up in the academic hierarchy. 
The professor took off his coat, and the two of them started wrenching at the crates. 


Profanity was freely used at the Met. Lab. 
It relieved the tension built up by having to work against time. 
Would Germany get atomic weapons before the United States developed them? 
Would these weapons come in time to help win the war? 
These unanswered questions constantly present in the minds of the leaders in the project pressed them to work faster and faster, to be tense, and to swear. 


Success was assured by the spring. 
A small pile assembled in the Squash Court showed that all conditions&emdash;purity of materials, distribution of uranium in the graphite lattice&emdash;were such that a pile of critical size would chain-react. 


&ldquo;It could be May, or early June at latest,&rdquo; Enrico told me, as we recently reminisced about the times of the Met. Lab. 
&ldquo;I remember I talked about that experiment on the Indiana dunes, and it was the first time I saw the dunes. 
You were still in Leonia. 
I went with a group from the Met. Lab. 
I liked the dunes: it was a clear day, with no fog to dim colors&hellip; .&rdquo; 


&ldquo;I don&#39;t want to hear about the dunes,&rdquo; I said. 
&ldquo;Tell me about that experiment.&rdquo; 


&ldquo;I like to swim in the lake, &hellip; &rdquo; Enrico paid no attention to my remark. 
I knew that he enjoyed a good swim, and I could well imagine him challenging a group of younger people, swimming farther and for a longer time than any of them, then emerging on the shore with a triumphant grin. 


&ldquo;Tell me about that experiment,&rdquo; I insisted. 


&ldquo;We came out of the water, and we walked along the beach.&rdquo; 


I began to feel impatient. 
He did not have to mention the walk. 
He always walks after swimming, dripping wet, water streaming from his hair. 
In 1942 there was certainly much more hair on his head to shed water, not just the little fringe on the sides and on the back that there is now, and it was much darker. 


&ldquo;&hellip; and I talked about the experiment with Professor Stearns. 
The two of us walked ahead of the others on the beach. 
I remember our efforts to speak in such a way that the others would not understand&rdquo; 


&ldquo;Why? Didn&#39;t everyone at the Met. Lab. know that you were building piles?&rdquo; 


&ldquo;They knew we built piles. 
They did not know that at last we had the certainty that a pile would work. 
The fact that a chain reaction was feasible remained classified material for a while. 
I could talk freely with Stearns because he was one of the leaders.&rdquo; 


&ldquo;If you were sure a larger pile would work, why didn&#39;t you start it at once?&rdquo; 


&ldquo;We did not have enough materials, neither uranium nor graphite. 
Procurement of uranium metal was always an obstacle. 
It hampered progress.&rdquo; 


While waiting for more materials, Herbert Anderson went to the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company to place an order for a square balloon. 
The Goodyear people had never heard of square balloons, they did not think they could fly. 
At first they threw suspicious glances at Herbert. 
The young man, however, seemed to be in full possession of his wits. 
He talked earnestly, had figured out precise specifications, and knew exactly what he wanted. 
The Goodyear people promised to make a square balloon of rubberized cloth. 
They delivered it a couple of months later to the Squash Court. 
It came neatly folded, but, once unfolded, it was a huge thing that reached from floor to ceiling. 


The Squash Court ceiling could not be pushed up as the physicists would have liked. 
They had calculated that their final pile ought to chain-react somewhat before it reached the ceiling. 
But not much margin was left, and calculations are never to be trusted entirely. 
Some impurities might go unnoticed, some unforeseen factor might upset theory. 
The critical size of the pile might not be reached at the ceiling. 
Since the physicists were compelled to stay within that very concrete limit, they thought of improving the performance of the pile by means other than size. 


The experiment at Columbia with a canned pile had indicated that such an aim might be attained by removing the air from the pores of the graphite. 
To can as large a pile as they were to build now would be impracticable, but they could assemble it inside a square balloon and pump the air from it if necessary. 


The Squash Court was not large. 
When the scientists opened the balloon and tried to haul it into place, they could not see its top from the floor. 
There was a movable elevator in the room, some sort of scaffolding on wheels that could raise a platform. 
Fermi climbed onto it, let himself be hoisted to a height that gave him a good view of the entire balloon, and from there he gave orders: 

&ldquo;All hands stand by!&rdquo; 

&ldquo;Now haul the rope and heave her!&rdquo; 

&ldquo;More to the right!&rdquo; 

&ldquo;Brace the tackles to the left!&rdquo; 

To the people below he seemed an admiral on his bridge, and &ldquo;Admiral&rdquo; they called him for a while. 


When the balloon was secured on five sides, with the flap that formed the sixth left down, the group began to assemble the pile inside it. 
Not all the material had arrived, but they trusted that it would come in time. 


From the numerous experiments they had performed so far, they had an idea of what the pile should be, but they had not worked out the details, there were no drawings nor blueprints and no time to spare to make them. 
They planned their pile even as they built it. 
They were to give it the shape of a sphere of about 26 feet in diameter, supported by a square frame, hence the square balloon. 


The pile supports consisted of blocks of wood. 
As a block was put in place inside the balloon, the size and shape of the next were figured. 
Between the Squash Court and the near-by carpenter&#39;s shop there was a steady flow of boys, who fetched finished blocks and brought specifications for more on bits of paper. 


When the physicists started handling graphite bricks, everything became black. 
The walls of the Squash Court were black to start with. 
Now a huge black wall of graphite was going up fast. 
Graphite powder covered the floor and made it black and as slippery as a dance floor. 
Black figures skidded on it, figures in overalls and goggles under a layer of graphite dust. 
There was one woman among them, Leona Woods; she could not be distinguished from the men, and she got her share of cussing from the bosses. 


The carpenters and the machinists who executed orders with no knowledge of their purpose and the high-school boys who helped lay bricks for the pile must have wondered at the black scene. 
Had they been aware that the altimate result would be an atomic bomb, they might have renamed the court Pluto&#39;s Workshop or Hell&#39;s Kitchen. 


To solve difl5culties as one meets them is much faster than to try to foresee them all in detail. 
As the pile grew, measurements were taken and further construction adapted to results. 


The pile never reached the ceiling. 
It was planned as a sphere 26 feet in diameter, but the last layers were never put into place. 
The sphere remained flattened at the top. 
To make a vacuum proved unnecessary, and the balloon was never sealed. 
The critical size of the pile was attained sooner than was anticipated. 


Only six weeks had passed from the laying of the first graphite brick, and it was the morning of December 2. 


Herbert Anderson was sleepy and grouchy. 
He had been up until two in the morning to give the pile its finishing touches. 
Had he pulled a control rod during the night, he could have operated the pile and have been the first man to achieve a chain reaction, at least in a material, mechanical sense. 
He had a moral duty not to pull that rod, despite the strong temptation. 
It would not be fair to Fermi. 
Fermi was the leader. 
He had directed research and worked out theories. 
His were the basic ideas. 
His were the privilege and the responsibility of conducting the final experiment and controlling the chain reaction. 


&ldquo;So the show was all Enrico&#39;s, and he had gone to bed early the night before,&rdquo; Herbert told me years later, and a bit of regret still lingered in his voice. 


Walter Zinn also could have produced a chain reaction during the night. 
He, too, had been up and at work. 
But he did not care whether he operated the pile or not; he did not care in the least. 
It was not his job. 


His task had been to smooth out difliculties diu-ing the pile construction. 
He had been some sort of general contractor: he had placed orders for material and made sure that they were delivered in time; he had supervised the machine shops where graphite was milled; he had spurred others to work faster, longer, more eflficiently. 
He had become angry, had shouted, and had reached his goal. 
In six weeks the pile was assembled, and now he viewed it with relaxed nerves and with that vague feeling of emptiness, of slight disorientation, which never fails to follow completion of a purposeful task. 
There is no record of what were the feelings of the three young men who crouched on top of the pile, under the ceiling of the square balloon. 
They were called the &ldquo;suicide squad.&rdquo; 
It was a joke, but perhaps they were asking themselves whether the joke held some truth. 
They were like firemen alerted to the possibility of a fire, ready to extinguish it. 
If something unexpected were to happen, if the pile should get out of control, they would &ldquo;extinguish&rdquo; it by flooding it with a cadmium solution. 
Cadmium absorbs neutrons and prevents a chain reaction. 


Leona Woods, the one girl in that group of men, was calm and composed; only the intensity of her deep dark eyes revealed the extent of her alertness. 


Among the persons who gathered in the Squash Court on that morning, one was not connected with the Met. Lab.&emdash;Mr. Crawford H. Greenewalt of E. I. duPont de Nemours, who later became the president of the company. 
Arthur Compton had led him there out of a near-by room where, on that day, he and other men from his company happened to be holding talks with top Army oflBcers. 


Mr. Greenewalt and the duPont people were in a difficult position, and they did not know how to reach a decision. 
The Army had taken over the Uranium Project on the previous August and renamed it Manhattan District. In September General Leslie R. Groves was placed in charge of it. 
General Groves must have been of a trusting nature: before a chain reaction was achieved, he was already urging the duPont de Nemours Company to build and operate piles on a production scale. 


In a pile, Mr. Greenewalt was told, a new element, plutonium, is created during uranium fission. 
Plutonium would probably be suited for making atomic bombs. 
So Greenewalt and his group had been taken to Berkeley to see the work done on plutonium, and then flown to Chicago for more negotiations with the Army. 


Mr. Greenewalt was hesitant. 
Of course his company would like to help win the war! 
But piles and plutonium! 


With the Army&#39;s insistent voice in his ears, Compton, who had attended the conference, decided to break the rules and take Mr.  Greenewalt to witness the first operation of a pile. 


They all climbed onto the balcony at the north end of the Squash Court; all, except the three boys perched on top of the pile and except a young physicist, George Weil, who stood alone on the floor by a cadmium rod that he was to pull out of the pile when so instructed. 


And so the show began. 


There was utter silence in the audience, and only Fermi spoke. 
His gray eyes betrayed his intense thinking, and his hands moved along with his thoughts. 


&ldquo;The pile is not performing now because inside it there are rods of cadmium which absorb neutrons. 
One single rod is sufficient to prevent a chain reaction. 
So our first step will be to pull out of the pile all control rods, but the one that George Weil will man.&rdquo; 
As he spoke others acted. Each chore had been assigned in advance and rehearsed. 
So Fermi went on speaking, and his hands pointed out the things he mentioned. 


&ldquo;This rod, that we have pulled out with the others, is automatically controlled. 
Should the intensity of the reaction become greater than a pre-set limit, this rod would go back inside the pile by itself. 


&ldquo;This pen will trace a line indicating the intensity of the radiation. 
When the pile chain-reacts, the pen will trace a line that will go up and up and that will not tend to level off. 
In other words, it will be an exponential line. 


&ldquo;Presently we shall begin our experiment. 
George will pull out his rod a little at a time. We shall take measurements and verifv that the pile will keep on acting as we have calculated. 


&ldquo;Weil will first set the rod at thirteen feet. 
This means that thirteen feet of the rod will still be inside the pile. 
The counters will click faster and the pen will move up to this point, and then its trace will level off. Go ahead, George!&rdquo; 


Eyes turned to the graph pen. 
Breathing was suspended. 
Fermi grinned with confidence. 
The counters stepped up their clicking; the pen went up and then stopped where Fermi had said it would.  
Greenewalt gasped audibly. 
Fermi continued to grin. 


He gave more orders. 
Each time Weil pulled the rod out some more, the counters increased the rate of their clicking, the pen raised to the point that Fermi predicted, then it leveled off. 


The morning went by. Fermi was conscious that a new experiment of this kind, carried out in the heart of a big city, might become a potential hazard unless all precautions were taken to make sure that at all times the operation of the pile conformed closely with the results of the calculations. 
In his mind he was sure that if George Weil&#39;s rod had been pulled out all at once, the pile would have started reacting at a leisurely rate and could have been stopped at will by reinserting one of the rods. 
He chose, however, to take his time and be certain that no unforeseen phenomenon would disturb the experiment. 


It is impossible to say how great a danger this unforeseen element constituted or what consequences it might have brought about. 
According to the theory, an explosion was out of the question. 
The release of lethal amounts of radiation through an uncontrolled reaction was improbable. 
Yet the men in the Squash Court were working with the unknown. 
They could not claim to know the answers to all the questions that were in their minds. Caution was welcome. 
Caution was essential. 
It would have been reckless to dispense with caution. 


So it was lunch time, and, although nobody else had given signs of being hungry, Fermi, who is a man of habits, pronounced the now historical sentence: 


&ldquo;Let&#39;s go to lunch.&rdquo; 


After lunch they all resumed their places, and now Mr. Greenewait was decidedly excited, almost impatient. 


But again the experiment proceeded by small steps, until it was 3:20. 


Once more Fermi said to Weil: 


&ldquo;Pull it out another foot&rdquo;; but this time he added, turning to the anxious group in the balcony: &ldquo;This will do it. 
Now the pile will chain-react.&rdquo; 


The counters stepped up; the pen started its upward rise. 
It showed no tendency to level off. 
A chain reaction was taking place in the pile. 


Leona Woods walked up to Fermi and in a voice in which there was no fear she whispered: &ldquo;When do we become scared?&rdquo; 


Under the ceiling of the balloon the suicide squad was alert, ready with their liquid cadmium: this was the moment. 
But nothing much happened. 
The group watched the recording instruments for 28 minutes. 
The pile behaved as it should, as they all had hoped it would, as they had feared it would not. 


The rest of the story is well known. 
Eugene Wigner, the Hungarian-born physicist who in 1939 with Szilard and Einstein had (See letter on alerted President Roosevelt to the importance of uranium fission, presented Fermi with a bottle of Chianti. 
According to an improbable legend, Wigner had concealed the bottle behind his back during the entire experiment.

All those present drank. 
From paper cups, in silence, with no toast. 
Then all signed the straw cover on the bottle of Chianti. 
It is the only record of the persons in the Squash Court on that day. 


The group broke up. 
Some stayed to round up their measurements and put in order the data gathered from their instruments. 
Others went to duties elsewhere. 
Mr. Greenewalt hastened to the room where his colleagues were still in conference with the military. 
He announced, all in one breath, that Yes, it would be quite all right for their company to go along with the Army&#39;s request and start to build piles. 
Piles were wonderful objects that performed with the precision of a Swiss watch, and, provided that the advice of such competent scientists as Fermi and his group were available, the duPont company was certainly taking no undue risk. 


Arthur Compton placed a long-distance call to Mr. Conant of the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Harvard. 


&ldquo;The Italian Navigator has reached the New World,&rdquo; said Compton as soon as he got Conant on the line. 

&ldquo;And how did he find the natives?&rdquo; 

&ldquo;Very friendly.&rdquo; 


Here the official story ends, but there is a sequel to it, which started on that same afternoon when a young physicist, Al Wattemberg, picked up the empty Chianti bottle from which all had drunk. 
With the signatures on its cover, it would make a nice souvenir. 
In subsequent years Al Wattemberg did his share of traveling, like any other physicist, and the bottle followed him. 
When big celebrations for the pile&#39;s tenth anniversary were planned at the University of Chicago, the bottle and Al Wattemberg were both in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
Both, Al promised, would be in Chicago on December 2. 


It so happened, however, that a little Wattemberg decided to come into this world at about that time, and Al could not attend the celebrations. 
So he shipped his bottle, and, because he wanted to make doubly sure that it would not be broken, he insured it for a thousand dollars. 
It is not often that an empty bottle is considered worth so much money, and newspaper men on the lookout for sensation gave the story a prominent position in the press.

F.D. Roosevelt, 

President of the United States, 

White House 

Washington; D.C. 



Sir: 

Some recent work ty E.Fermi and L. Szilard, which has teen com- 
municated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uran- 
ium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the im- 
mediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem 
to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part 
of the Administration. I "believe therefore that it is my duty to bring 
to your attention the following facts and recommendations: 

In the course of the last four months it has been made probable - 
through the work of Joliot in Prance as well as Permi and Szilard in 
America - that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction 
in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power and large quant- 
ities of new radium-like elements would be generated. How it appears 
almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future. 

This new phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, 
and it is conceivable - though much less certain - that extremely power- 
ful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this 
type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy 
the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, 
such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by 
air. 









The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate 
quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, 
while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo. 

In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some 
permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group 
of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way 
of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person 
who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial 
capacity. His task might comprise the following: 

a) to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the 
further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, 
giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uran- 
ium ore for the United States; 

b) to speed ut) the experimental work»which is at present being car- 
ried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by 
providinst funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with 
private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, 
sold perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories 
which have the necessary equipment. 

I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium 
from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should 
have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground 
that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsacker, is 
attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the 
American work on uranium is now being repeated. 

Yours very truly, 

(Albert Einstein)
