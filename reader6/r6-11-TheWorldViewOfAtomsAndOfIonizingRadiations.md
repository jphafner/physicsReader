## The world of new atoms and of ionizing radiation
\label{sec:21.11}

We have gained, as by-products of atomic power, very many new types of radioactive atoms or radioisotopes. 
There are now about 1100 nuclides that are new and man-made. 
Each is unstable, but changes in its own time to a more stable form. 
The change is accompanied by the emission of radiation, either in the form of a $\gamma$-ray photon, $\beta$-ray, sometimes positron, an $\alpha$-particle, or some other form or combination. 
Each nuclide has the chemical properties of a stable, conventional atom, but in addition each also emits radiation of a type and energy that is characteristic of that nuclide. 
Also, each unstable nuclide (radioisotope) has a particular time rate or half-life for its change of form. 


The early forms of Mendeleev&#39;s Periodic Table of the atoms listed up to 92 elements. 
Within the limited science and technology revolving around the chemistry of these elements, there were built up vast chemical industries. 
The chart of over 1300 nuclides now offers a much larger variety of atoms and building blocks out of which to develop an understanding of atomic behavior. 

For example, consider the isotopes of carbon. 
Two stable forms of carbon are found in nature, one of mass 12 (C<sup>12</sup>) and one of mass 13 (C<sup>13</sup>).
When nitrogen-14 (N<sup>14</sup>) is bombarded by neutrons, it captures a neutron and emits a proton, leaving a new atom which has six protons and which therefore behaves chemically like carbon. 
This is the isotope C<sup>14</sup>, which is unstable and eventually emits a weak $\beta$-particle as it reverts back to the original stable N<sup>14</sup>.
The half-life for this transition is very long, about 5700 years, and the $\beta$-ray energy is 0.156 MeV. 


These C<sup>14</sup> atoms become important for several purposes. 
\footnote{
    We have already discussed the use of C</sup>14</sup> in radioactivity dating techniques in Chapters 2 and 20. 
}
They may be incorporated into drugs that contain carbon. 
When the drug is injected into man or animal (or incorporated into carbon dioxide gas, which may be absorbed by a plant), it becomes possible to follow the course of the carbon in these systems simply by &ldquo;tracing&rdquo; the behavior of the C<sup>14</sup> components; this is done by measuring the radiation they emit. 
Both time rate and distribution of the drug (or CO<sub>2</sub>}) in these complex systems can then be determined even though the systems themselves are already full of carbon atoms. 
This process has made it possible to identify a long series of intermediate steps in the photosynthesis of carbon dioxide for plant growth. 
The use of radioactive carbon (C<sup>14</sup>) and radioactive species of salts has clarified the understanding of many of the biological processes involved in human blood flow, the diffusion of salts across body membranes, and metabolic activity. 
Industry has found activation analysis to be particularly sensitive to contaminants in metals or other materials and has used it for identifying these contaminants. 
Considerable literature has been written about the characteristics and uses of radioisotopes. 
Many useful publications and references are available through the AEC.

    The piston rings are first made radioactive by exposing them to neutrons in a nuclear reactor, then installed in a motor which is under test for wear characteristics. 
    As the piston ring loses metal to the oil, the presence of radioactivity in the oil gives a measure of the wear while the motor is running. 
    When the motor is disassembled, the transfer of metal to the cylinder wall can also be measured accurately. Advantages: (i) transfer of metal measured to 1/1,000,000 ounce; (2) oil sampled during operation of motor; (3) rapid, simple, economical. (Courtesy of U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.)

Figures 21.13, 21.14, 21.15, 21.16, and 21.17 illustrate some applications involving radioisotopes. 



Radiotracer and dating techniques require relatively weak concentrations of C<sup>14</sup>, of the order of microcuries. 
In such applications all that is required of the emitted radiation is that it be measurable, either with Geiger (or similar) counters or with photographic film. 


The various types and energies of radiation have penetrating power of differing orders. 
For example, $\alpha$-particles can be stopped by a sheet of paper; $\beta$-particles may require from several sheets of paper to inches of solid material to stop them, depending on their energy. 
Gamma rays can penetrate inches of lead. 
By selecting suitable radiation, one may easily construct gauges for industrial applications that may be used for a wide range of thicknesses. 


As noted earlier, the analytic technique called activation analysis has become important for industry as well as for research.
\footnote{
    The term activation analysis refers to the process of making a material (which may be a contaminant) radioactive by bombardment with suitable nuclear radiation. 
}
If a specimen has a very small amount or trace of impurities and is placed in the neutron flux of a nuclear reactor, the trace impurities (as well as the main body of the specimen in some cases) become radioactive. 
In many cases the type and amount of the impurity can be determined by comparing the results of irradiation of the unknown sample with the results one obtains by irradiating specimens with known impurities.

    This is a series of six radioiodine scans of the neck and chest of a patient with cancer of the thyroid, made over a period of 16 months at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies. 
    The initial scan (top, left) shows the pattern of the normal thyroid tissue (dark lines) and the presence of the tumor is questionable. 
    With subsequent therapeutic doses of radioiodine, the normal thyroid is progressively fainter and the tumor becomes more apparent as it takes up the radioiodine. 
    Finally, shrinkage in the size of the tumor begins (lower, right scan) as a result of the radioiodine therapy. (AEC Report for 1965.)

    A patient at the Medical Research Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory is shown in the photo top undergoing treatment for leukemia by extracorporeal irradiation of his blood. 
    The nurse is about to connect the arteriovenous shunt in the patient&#39;s forearm to the tubing leading into a shielded container where the gamma-ray source is located. 
    The technique, as diagrammed below, was applied to the study and treatment of human leukemia following extensive studies of the origin, function, and turnover rates of cells and other blood constituents of normal and leukemic cows. 
    The purpose of this form of treatment is to destroy leukemic white cells in the blood without injuring other cells or organs in the body; the red blood cells are much more resistant to radiation damage than the leukemic cells. 
    A semipermanent external arteriovenous shunt, which may last for many months, is inserted in the patient&#39;s forearm. 
    Arterial blood is propelled by the action of the heart through plastic tubing into the shielded container, past an intense source of gamma rays, and back into the patient&#39;s arm. 
    As the blood passes through the gamma source (4000 curies of cesium-137) it receives a radiation dose of from 250 to 900  rads, depending upon its flow rate (900 rads would be a lethal dose of radiation if applied to the whole body). 
    The treatment can be repeated as necessary to reduce the numbers of leukemic cells in the blood. (Courtesy Brookhaven National Laboratory.)

The sensitivity of activation analysis is illustrated by the following case: Ordinary arsenic, arsenic-75, on capturing a neutron, becomes radioactive arsenic, arsenic-76, which emits beta and gamma radiation on decay. 
Therefore, by radioactive assay, one can determine the concentration of arsenic in a sample. 
In 1961 a group of Scottish and Swedish scientists subjected a few strands of hair, cut from the head of Napoleon at his death in 1821, to neutron irradiation and found arsenic to be present in thirteen times normal concentration, thus suggesting that Napoleon might have been poisoned. 
Closer investigation indicated a definite pattern of the variation of arsenic concentration in the hair. 
This pattern, when compared with the record of Napoleon&#39;s sickness, revealed a correlation with his periods of severest pain. 
It seems arsenic was in the medicine given to relieve his pain and it may have had untoward effects as well. 


## Effects and products of ionizing radiation
\label{sec:21.12}


The ionizing radiation given off by radioactive isotopes can be concentrated and intense. 
Since this radiation is highly penetrating and ionizing, and induces changes in biological and chemical systems, it promises to become significant in chemical processing and in destroying unwanted bacteria (such as in milk) and tissues (such as in tumors, cancers). 
But this promise is a mixed blessing and curse, for overexposure to radiation is a health hazard. 
It has been found to cause leucopenia (decrease in number of white cells in blood), epilation (loss of hair), sterility, cancer, mutations (altered heredity of offspring), bone necrosis (destruction and death of bones), and eye cataracts. 


In conventional processes, chemical reactions proceed as a result of atomic collision, favorable valence combinations, excitement of atom systems by heating. 
Coulomb attraction, free radical inters, mediates, and other similar activators. 
The energy exchanges are likely to be of the order of a few electron volts or less per atom (or molecule). 


When swift, charged particles (such as $\alpha$-particles, protons, or $\beta$-particles) pass through matter, they leave tracks of ionized and excited atoms and molecules, which undergo vigorous reorganization. 
The concentration of energy can be hundreds or more times the intensity of conventional processes, especially with heavy charged particles and toward the end of particle tracks in the material. 
As a result, radiation effects are often deleterious to the properties of the material. 


There are, however, applications wherein the destructiveness of radiation is desirable, such as for killing insects that infest grain or microbe systems in medical supplies. 
There are also cases where the reorganization of atoms and molecules following irradiation results in improved physical properties or produces desired chemical changes. Radiation induces such widely different reactions that it becomes a very versatile research tool. 
Processing by irradiation also appears to have very real possibilities of competing with some conventional industrial processes and of inducing reactions that cannot be produced by other means. 


The activities involving radiation and radiation chemistry may be grouped under six categories: food preservation, sterilization, chemical processing, radiography and medical therapy, radioisotope power sources, miscellaneous. 


Since ionizing radiation can be lethal to living organisms and microorganisms, one of the early programs sought to sterilize foodstuffs and thus give them longer shelf life. Early efforts concentrated on sterilizing meats and other foods by radiation dosage ranging from 2 to 5 mega rads (million rads
\footnote{
    A rad represents the absorption of 100 ergs of radiation energy per gram of absorbing material. 
}).
The results of these early years were not successful because the heavy dose caused changes in the taste and appearance of foods. 
More recent work has been much more encouraging. 
In 1963 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sterilization of bacon by gamma radiation (up to 2.2 MeV energy) and by electron beams (up to 5 MeV energy) from accelerators. 
The sterilization of ham, chicken, and beef appears promising. 


When the radiation dose is kept well below the doses required for sterilization, down to values of 500,000 rads or less, the effect is to &ldquo;pasteurize&rdquo; foods in a way that often permits longer shelf life. 
For example, a dose of 250,000 rads will extend the shelf life of haddock fillets to 21 days at 32 to 33 &deg;F.
Crabmeat treated with 200,000 rads had its shelf life increased from 7 days to 35 days when held at 33 &deg;F. 
Fruits (strawberries, cherries, citrus, pears, tomatoes) show similar gain. 
Insects in grains and wormy (helminthic) parasites such as those associated with trichinosis from pork are killed by 30,000 rads. 
Sprouting of potato tubers can be inhibited with doses from 10,000 to 15,000 rads. 
But dosages in excess of 10 million rads appear to be needed to inactivate some enzymes. 


Radiation does not raise the temperature of the processed materials at these dosages. 
Furthermore, with $\gamma$-radiation, the whole process can be mechanized and the foods can be irradiated in the packaged state. 
The main difficulty is the cost of the radiation, whether one uses radioisotopic sources or an accelerator. 
The irradiation of fish adds from 1 to 3 cents per pound, which is probably acceptable. 
Because strawberries may cost about 50 cents per pound, they can stand an irradiation expense of an additional $1\frac{3}{4}$ cents per pound. 
But for other fruits and for grains, the cost probably must remain at \num{1} cent per pound, to be economically acceptable.
To help this industrial development, the Commission has reduced the selling price for certain radioisotopes such as cobalt-60 (Co<sup>60</sup>, which emits strong $\gamma$-rays of 1.1 MeV and 1.3 MeV and has a half-life of 5.3 years) and cesium-137 (Cs<sup>137</sup>, which emits gammas of 0.66 MeV with a half-life of about 33 years). 


Radiation costs come down sharply as the radiation intensity of the facility is increased, in terms of kilowatt capacity, for either radioisotopic sources or accelerator sources. 
But it is difficult to find many geographic sites where one can provide high enough production quantities to bring the cost of radiation pasteurization down to 1 cent per pound. 


How about irradiation to sterilize materials that are not foodstuffs, such as medical supplies, sutures, bandages, and drugs? 
While there are limitations in this area also, there are some real advantages to radiation processes as compared with the use of heat, chemicals, or ultraviolet light. 
When penetrating radiation is used, sutures or other supplies can be packaged in conventional work areas and then irradiated while in sealed state. 


## Radiography and medical therapy
\label{sec:21.13}

These two subjects may be treated together because they depend on similar sources and techniques. 
Gamma rays are very penetrating&emdash;more so than X-rays from conventional machines. 
A cobalt-60 source can therefore be used effectively for penetrating metal parts, castings, tank walls, and the human body. 
As in X-rays, the radiation that passes through the target or body can be recorded on photographic film or on a fluorescent screen, to give a faithful picture of the variations of matter through which it passes. 
Flaws, cracks, cavities will show up as clearly as with X-rays. 

The advantages of radioisotopic gamma sources over X-ray machines are three: 

(1) These sources can be made portable and do not require electric power for their operation. 

(2) Radioisotopes emit radiation in all directions, which makes it possible to obtain radiographs all around a vessel into which the source is placed. 

(3) Radioisotopes can provide higher penetrating power without requiring excessively large installations. 

Very many industrial firms make use of such radioisotopes as Co<sup>60</sup>, which is equivalent to 2.5 MeV X-rays and can be used for steel of 2 to 5 inch thickness. 
For lesser penetrability, iridium-192 (Ir<sup>192</sup>), cesium-134 (Cs<sup>134</sup>), and Cs<sup>137</sup> are the equivalent of up to 1400 keV X-rays and are useful for radiographing steel plates from 1 2 inch thickness (or an equivalent density of other materials). 
Thulium-170 (Tm<sup>170</sup>), europium-155 (Eu<sup>155</sup>), and certain isotopes of americium (Am) provide still lower penetration. 


For many fixed installations. 
X-ray machines may be preferred. 
Some industrial firms engaged in the production and testing of tanks, ships, and transmission pipe in the field have found the radioisotopic sources to be much more practical than X-ray machines. 


We have noted that radiation kills living organisms. 
Malignant disease in body tissue can often be arrested by exposure to penetrating, ionizing radiation. 
But since healthy tissue also suffers, radiation must be applied carefully and restrictively to the tissues to be treated. 
This has given rise to very many designs that use radioisotopic sources in the form of tiny needles that are inserted into tissue; or the sources may be contained in a housing that directs a well-collimated beam onto the tissue. 


Radioisotopic sources offer portability and considerable choice in the type and energy of radiation that they emit. 
Also they can be fabricated into very many shapes and sizes.
