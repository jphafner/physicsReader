<span class="textsc">Shortly</span> after the Second World War, when the normal international life of science was resumed, a physicist who had just listened to several hours of technical lectures at a large conference remarked that the international language of physics had become a combination of mathematics and broken English: Today, almost all scientific journals, including the Russian&emdash;and even the Chinese journals, such as the <em>Acta Mathematica Sinica</em>, and <em>Scientia Sinica</em>, published in Peking&emdash;give at least the title of each article, and often an abstract, in English. 
From the title and the equations and the graphs, a specialist in the field can usually reconstruct the general theme of the article. 
The exchange of articles and journals among scientists of different countries is one of the oldest and best traditions of science. 
It goes on independently of the political climate. 
During the darkest days of the Stalinist period in Russia, scientific papers went back and forth across the Iron Curtain, and Western physicists could follow the work of such Russians as Lev Landau (the most distinguished Russian theoretical physicist, who won the Nobel Prize in 1962), despite the fact that he was under house arrest in Moscow, in part because of his liberal ideas and in part because he is a Jew. 


With the death of Stalin and the relaxation of some of the tensions between East and West, it became possible for scientists to travel in and out of the Eastern countries. 
The so called Rochester Conference in High-Energy Physics (it gets its name from the fact that the first seven conferences, starting in 1950, were held in Rochester, New York) now meets one year in the United States, one year in Geneva, and one year&emdash;indeed, last summer&emdash;in the Soviet Union. 
Several American universities have regular exchange programs with Soviet universities, and it is no longer a novelty to find a Russian physicist giving a series of lectures m an American university, and vice versa. 


<span class="textsc">The</span> ultimate in international scientific cooperation is, of course, the international scientific laboratory, in which scientists of many countries can actually work together. 
In fact, it is becoming increasingly clear that such laboratories are not only desirable but necessary. 
Research in a field like high-energy physics&emdash;in a way, the rtiost basic of all the sciences, since it is the study of elementary particles, the ultimate constituents of all matter&emdash;has become so expensive that many people have come to believe that pursuing it as a purely national enterprise is difficult to justify. 
A recent editorial in the <em>New York Times</em> pointed out that &ldquo;high-energy physicists &hellip; use the most elaborate and most expensive equipment employed in any branch of terrestrial basic research,&rdquo; and went on to say, &ldquo;These are the particle accelerators, which today cost tens of millions of dollars each, and which will in the future be priced in the hundreds of millions. 
The Atomic Energy Commission&#39;s operating and construction costs in this field are already expected to aggregate $165 million in the next fiscal year, and one authoritative estimate places the annual bill by the end of the next decade at $370 million, reaching $600 million by 1980 Nuclear physicists are already talking about far more powerful&emdash;and much more expensive&emdash;atomic-research instruments.
The case for building these machines is an impressive one, but the case for building them only with the resources of one country is not convincing.&rdquo;

The editorial concluded by pointing out that there already exists an excellent working example of an international atomic laboratory; namely, CERN (standing for Conseil Europ&eacute;en pour la Recherche Nucl&eacute;aire), which is operated jointly by almost all the Western 
European countries and is situated in the Swiss town of Meyrin, a suburb of Geneva that is almost on the French frontier, CERN itself sprawls along the frontier, and recently, when it needed room for expansion, the French government gave it a ninety-nine-year lease on a hundred acres of French land, matching the hundred acres of Swiss territory that the center now occupies. 
This makes CERN the only international organization that actually straddles a frontier. 
Its facilities include two accelerators (the larger, a proton synchrotron, accelerates protons to energies up to twenty-eight billion electron volts, and shares with its slightly more powerful twin, the alternating gradient synchrotron at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, on Long Island, the distinction of being the largest accelerator now operating), several electronic computers, and a vast collection of bubble chambers, spark chambers, and other paraphernalia necessary for experimenting with the particles produced in the accelerators&emdash;to say nothing of machine shops, a cafeteria, a bank, a travel agency, a post office, a large library, and a multitude of secretarial and administrative offices. 
It costs about twenty-five million dollars a year to run. 
This money is contributed by thirteen European member states&emdash;Austria, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and West Germany. 
Neither the United States nor Russia is eligible to become a member, since neither is &ldquo;European,&rdquo; but there are Americans and Russians who work at CERN, An exchange agreement exists between CERN and DUBNA, a similar laboratory near Moscow, where physicists from the Iron Curtain countries and China work together. 
Each year, DUBNA sends two or three physicists to CERN for several months at a time. 
American physicists at CERN have been supported by sabbatical salaries, by fellowships like the Guggenheim and the National Science Foundation, or by money from Ford Foundation grants (totalling a bit over a million dollars) that were given to the laboratory explicitly for the support of scientists from nonmember countries. 
(The grants have now been discontinued, following the Ford policy of &ldquo;pump-priming,&rdquo; and the laboratory is looking for other sources of money.) 
There are usually twenty or twenty-five Americans at CERN, In addition, the laboratory has contingents of Japanese, Indians, Poles (a very active and scientifically strong group of about a dozen), Yugoslavs, Turks, Israelis (there is an exchange agreement with the Weizmann Institute, in Rehovoth), and Hungarians, All the permanent personnel at CERN&emdash;about sixteen hundred people, of whom about three hundred are physicists and engineers&emdash;are drawn from the member states, (Their average age is thirty-two.) 
As one might imagine, all this produces a tutti-frutti of languages, national types, political attitudes, and social mannerisms, and everyone accepts ind enjoys the chaos of national flavors as part of the working atmosphere of the laboratory. 
As an American physicist and a perennial summer visitor to CERN, I have had fairly typical experiences there. 
This past summer, I worked with an Italian physicist in an attempt to extend some work done by a German-born American physicist who was visiting the laboratory on a Guggenheim Fellowship. 
This work was itself an extension of another Italian physicist&#39;s work, which, in turn, was based on the work of an American physicist who is a frequent visitor to CERN.
(I also helped a Yugoslav physicist with the English translation of a short book written by a well-known Russian physicist whom I met when he visited CERN to attend the Rochester Conference of 1962, which was held in Geneva.)
My working language with the Italian physicist was English (and, of course, mathematics). 
Most of the people at the laboratory are polylingual. 
All scientific lectures are given in English, and almost all the technical personnel have a good command of the language. 
However, the language one hears most often is French; the secretaries, postmen, bank clerks, mechanics, and telephone operators speak it among themselves, and so &#39; do many of the European physicists. 
Secretaries must be able to type technical manuscripts in English, since almost all the publications that come out of CERN each year (several hundred of them) are in that language. 


Because nuclear physics has become so closely associated (at least in the public mind) with its military applications, many people have wondered how a laboratory that intermingles physicists from the East and the West&emdash;and, indeed, from all over the world&emdash;can possibly operate without running into all sorts of problems of military security and national secrecy. 
The answer is that nuclear physics is a very broad subject. 
It ranges from the study of nuclear energy&emdash;fission, fusion, reactors, and the like&emdash;to the study of the interior structure of the nucleus, and even to the study of the structure of the very neutrons and protons and other particles that compose the nucleus. 
This latter study is the frontier of modern physics. 
Because high-energy particles are necessary in order to probe deeply into the interior of the nucleus, this branch of physics is called &ldquo;high-energy,&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;low-energy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;classical&rdquo;&emdash;&ldquo;classical&rdquo; in that the laws governing the behavior of the nuclei in, say, the fission process in a reactor are now pretty well understood, and have been for some time. 
The military and technological applications of nuclear physics are based on these latter laws, whereas the study of the interior structure of the nucleus has no technological applications at present; more than that, it is difficult now to imagine any such applications in the future. 
However, the example of Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity&emdash;one of the most abstract theories in physics&emdash;which has been the basis of the entire development of nuclear energy, shows that theoretical speculations that may at the moment seem far removed from reality can very quickly change all of technology. 


The very fact that high-energy physics does not have military applications was among the reasons it was chosen as the discipline for an international laboratory. 
In the late nineteen-forties, when a number of prominent physicists&emdash;including the late H. A. Kramers, of Holland; Pierre Auger and Francis Perrin, of France; Edouardo Amaldi, of Italy; and J. Robert Oppenheimer, of the United States&emdash;began informally discussing the prospects for creating an international laboratory in Europe, they set out to look for a field that would be sufficiently close to recent developments in atomic energy for European governments to be interested in supporting the project financially, and yet far enough removed from immediate applications of atomic energy for military security not to be a problem. 
They also realized that it would be necessary to engage the support of the European diplomats who were then promoting attempts to create a United Europe. 
One of the most influential of these diplomats was Francois de Rose, of France. 
(He is now the French Ambassador to Portugal.) 
De Rose became interested in the possibilities of atomic research just after the war, and in 1946 he met with Oppenheimer in New York at the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. 
Out of the resulting friendship between the two men an important link developed between the scientific and diplomatic communities. 
Dr. L.  Kowarski, a French nuclear scientist and one of the pioneers of CERN, has written a semi-official history of the origins of the laboratory, in which he notes: 

<blockquote>
    The first public manifestation of this new link occurred in December, 1949, at the European Cultural Conference held in Lausanne. 
    A message from Louis de Broglie [de Broglie, the most distinguished French theoretical physicist of modern times, was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1929 for his work on the wave nature of electrons] was read by Dautry [Raoul Dautry was at that time the administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission and one of the leaders of the movement for a United Europe], in which the proposal was made to create in Europe an international research institution, to be equipped on a financial scale transcending the individual possibilities of the member nations.
    &hellip; At that time [a dilemma] was besetting the scientists&#39; aspirations: atomic energy was attracting public readiness to spend money, but atomic energy invited security-mindedness and separatism. 
    The way out of the dilemma was clear enough. 
    The domain of common action should be chosen so as not to infringe directly the taboos on uranium fission, but [to be] close enough to it so as to allow any successes gained internationally in the permitted field to exert a beneficial influence on the national pursuits. 
</blockquote>


The ultimate choice&emdash;high-energy physics&emdash;was a perfect compromise; although it is a branch of nuclear physics, it is one that is far removed from military applications. 


In June of 1950, the American physicist I. I. Rabi initiated the first practical step toward the creation of such a pan-European laboratory. 
As a member of the United States delegation to UNESCO he was attending the UNESCO conference held that year in Florence. 
Speaking officially on behalf of the United States, he moved that UNESCO use its good offices to set up a physics laboratory (he had high-energy physics in mind) with facilities that would be beyond those that any single European country could provide, and that would be comparable to the major American facilities at Brookhaven and Berkeley. 
It was an important step, because it placed the prestige and influence of American science behind the project. 
The implementation of Rabi&#39;s motion became the work of Pierre Auger, of France, a distinguished physicist who was the UNESCO scientific director. 
As a result of his efforts, various cultural commissions of the French, Italian, and Belgian governments donated about ten thousand dollars for a study program, and CERN was under way. 
(In the course of the discussions held at that time, Rabi stressed the desirability of not having any nuclear reactors at CERN, since they have both military and commercial applications&emdash;and, in fact, there are none.) 
Dr. Kowarski writes: 

<blockquote>
    Two objectives were suggested: a longer-range, very ambitious project of an accelerator second to none in the world [this resulted in the construction of the proton synchrotron, which was completed in 1959] and, in addition, the speedy construction of a less powerful and more classical machine in order to start European experimentation in high-energy physics at an early date and so cement the European unity directed to a more difficult principal undertaking. 
</blockquote>

At the end of 1951, an organizational meeting was held in Paris; all the European members of UNESCO were invited, but there was no response from the countries of Eastern Europe. 
Then, at a meeting held in Geneva early in 1952, eleven countries signed an agreement pledging funds and establishing a provisional organization. 
There was something of a tug-of-war among the member countries to decide where the new laboratory should be built. 
The Danes, the Dutch, the French, and the Swiss all had suitable territory for it, but in the end Geneva was chosen, partly because of its central location, partly because of its long tradition of housing international organizations (there are, for example, all sorts of multilingual elementary schools in the city)&emdash;and, it is said, partly because some of the physicists involved in the decision were avid skiers. 
The Swiss government gave, free, the site near Meyrin, and in June, 1953, the Canton of Geneva formally ratified, by popular referendum, the government&#39;s invitation to CERN to settle there; in addition, the laboratory was given the same political status as that of any of the other international organizations in Geneva. 
At the same time, a formal CERN Convention was prepared for the signature of the member states, which then numbered twelve; Austria and Spain joined later, and Yugoslavia, an original signatory, withdrew in 1962, because of a lack of foreign currency. 
Article II of the Convention stipulates: &ldquo;The Organization shall provide for collaboration among European States in nuclear research of a pure scientific and fundamental character, and in research essentially related thereto. 
The Organization shall have no concern with work for military requirements, and the results of its experimental and theoretical work shall be published or otherwise made generally available.&rdquo; 
The Convention also set up a formula for CERN&#39;s financial support. 
Roughly speaking, each member nation pays each year a certain percentage (a fraction of one per cent) of its gross national product. 
This means, in practice, that Great Britain, France, and West Germany pay the largest shares. 
The CERN Council, the governing body of the laboratory, was set up, with two delegates from each country&emdash;one a scientist and the other a diplomat, like de Rose. 
The Council meets twice a year to pass on such matters as the budget and the future development of the laboratory.
(During my last visit to CERN, there was a Council meeting in which the question of constructing a still larger international machine&emdash;a machine capable of accelerating protons to three hundred billion electron volts, or about ten times the capacity of the present machine&emdash;was discussed.) 
The Council also, by a two-thirds majority, appoints the Director-General of the laboratory. 
The Director-Generalship of CERN is a very complex job, and few people are really qualified for it. 
In the first place, the Director-General can have no special national bias. 
As the Convention puts it, &ldquo;The responsibilities of the Director and the staff in regard to the Organization shall be exclusively international in character.&rdquo; 
In the second place, the Director must clearly be a physicist, for, among other things, he must decide which of various extremely expensive experiments the laboratory should concentrate on. 
The first Director, chosen in 1954, was Professor Felix Bloch, of Stanford University&emdash;a Swiss by origin and a Nobel Prize winner in physics. 
Professor Bloch returned to Stanford in 1955 and was succeeded by C. J. Bakker, a Dutch cyclotron builder. (Professor Bakker was responsible for the construction of the cyclotron, the smaller of the accelerators at CERN.) 
He held the post from 1955 to 1960, when he was killed in an airplane accident on his way to Washington, where he had intended to deliver a report on the operation of the large accelerator, the proton synchrotron, which had gone into operation in 1959. 



<span class="textsc">If</span> any one individual was responsible for the successful construction of the large accelerator, it was John B. Adams, an Englishman, who took over the Director-Generalship on Bakker&#39;s death. 
Adams was born in 1920 in Kingston, Surrey, and received his education in English grammar schools. 
At eighteen, he went to work for the Telecommunications Research Establishment, and when the war broke out he joined the Ministry of Aircraft Production. 
He had received some training in electronics with the Telecommunications Establishment, and in the M.A.P. he became involved with the problem of installing the first radar in fighter planes. 
It soon became evident that he had a gift both for engineering and for the complex job of directing a large technical project. 
In fact, the war produced a whole generation of young scientists and engineers who not only were technically competent but had acquired considerable practical experience in running large-scale and costly scientific enterprises. 
These men moved readily into the various atomic-energy programs that were started after the war, and Adams joined the nuclear laboratory at Harwell, the principal British center for experimental work in nuclear physics. 
At this time, the people at Harwell were beginning work on a hundred-and-seventy-five-million-volt proton accelerator, and Adams became an important member of the project. 
The machine was finished in 1949, and Adams spent the next three years working on the design of special radio tubes needed in connection with accelerators. 
Then he was released by the Ministry of Supply to go to Geneva and join the new accelerator project at CERN. 


By that time, the CERN group, which had been at work since 1951, had inherited a technological windfall in the way of accelerator design. 
A particle accelerator can accelerate only those particles that carry an electric charge. 
Advantage is taken of the fact that when a charged particle passes through an electric field it is accelerated by the force that the field exerts on it. 
In modern accelerators, transmitting tubes generate the electromagnetic fields, in the same way that radio transmitters generate radio waves. 
These accelerating stations are placed at intervals along the path of the particles in the machine, the simplest arrangement being along a straight line. 
This layout results in what is called a linear accelerator, or LINAC. 
The particles move faster and faster in a straight line and are finally shot out the other end into a target of some sort. 
The energy that such particles can acquire is limited by the length of the straight line, as well as by the power of the transmitters. 
At Stanford University, there is a nearly completed straight-line accelerator, known among physicists as &ldquo;the monster,&rdquo; that will accelerate electrons over a path almost two miles long; the emerging electrons will have an energy of about twenty billion electron volts. 
Most accelerators, however, are circular. 
The accelerating stations are arranged along the perimeter, and as the particles go around and around they acquire more energy in each orbit. 
This arrangement saves space and greatly reduces the number and size of the accelerating stations. 
The problem that naturally arises is how to maintain the particles in circular paths while they are being accelerated, since a particle will move in a circle only if a force acts on it to keep it from flying off at a tangent. 
In circular accelerators, this force is supplied by electromagnets. 
The magnets are deployed along the path of the particles, and the magnetic fields they produce hold the particles in orbit. 
The drawback to this system is that the more energy a particle acquires, the more strongly it resists staying in a circular orbit and the larger the magnet required to keep it so. 
In fact, as the postwar accelerators became more and more powerful, the size of their magnets began to get out of hand. 
The Brookhaven cosmotron, a proton accelerator producing protons with an energy of three billion electron volts, has a magnet of four thousand tons; the Berkeley bevatron, with six-billion-electron-volt protons, has a magnet weighing ten thousand tons; and, most striking of all, the Russian phasotron at DUBNA, which produces protons of ten billion electron volts, has a magnet weighing thirty-six thousand tons. 


This was where things stood in 1952, when the CERN group planned to make an accelerator of at least ten billion electron volts. 
By using a somewhat modified and more economical design than the one for the DUBNA machine, the new accelerator could have been made with a magnet weighing from ten to fifteen thousand tons, but even this seemed monstrous at the time. 
That year, however, a group at Brookhaven consisting of E. Courant, M. S. Livingston, and H. Snyder, in the course of solving a problem put to them by a group of visiting accelerator experts from CERN, invented a principle of magnetic focussing that altered the situation completely. 
(It turned out later that their method had been independently invented a few years earlier by an American-born Greek n med N. 
Christofilos, who was employed in Greece selling elevators for an American firm and was a physicist in his spare time. 
Christofilos had sent a manuscript describing his invention to Berkeley, where it was forgotten until news of the work at Brookhaven reminded somebody of it. 
Christofilos is now at the Livermore Laboratory of the University of California.) 
The magnet in a circular accelerator not only bends the particle trajectories into circles but applies a force that focusses the beam and keeps it from spreading out indefinitely as it goes around and around. 
The magnets in the old machines could supply only very weak focussing; thus the beam was pretty thick, and the vacuum pipe it circulated in and the magnet surrounding it also had to be large. 
(At Berkeley, a man can crawl through the vacuum chamber.) 
It was known, however, that magnets could be made that would give much stronger focussing forces, but only in one direction at a time; that is, if the beam were kept confined horizontally it would expand vertically, and vice versa. 
What the Brookhaven people found was that if an accelerator magnet ring was built up of alternate sections that provided strong focussing and defocussing forces, the net result was a focussing much stronger than anything that had previously been achieved. 
(In the new machines, the beam can be contained in a vacuum pipe only a few inches in diameter.) 
This meant that the magnets could be much smaller in size, with a great saving of weight, power, and cost. 
The CERN magnetic system weighs only three thousand tons, although the proton energies achieved are nearly three times those generated by the old Russian machine, which had a magnet weighing over ten times as much. 
The focussing works so well that the final beam of particles, which consists of about a thousand billion protons per second, is only a few millimetres wide when it emerges from the machine. 
The ring around which the protons race is about two hundred metres in diameter. 
The protons are injected into the main circular track by a small linear accelerator, and in the single second that they remain in the machine they make about half a million revolutions. 
The entire ring must be kept at a fairly high vacuum, since otherwise the protons would knock about in the air and be scattered. 
There is also a delicate question of timing. 
The accelerating fields must deliver a kick to each bunch of protons at just the right instant in its orbit. 
As the protons move faster and faster, approaching the speed of light, the synchronization of the fields and the particles must be constantly changed. 
However, according to Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity, no particle can go faster than light, so that near the end of the cycle the protons will be gaining energy but not speed (the particles, again according to the relativity theory, get heavier and heavier as they move faster and faster), which simplifies the timing problem somewhat. 
Indeed, high-energy-accelerator design, which uses the theory of relativity extensively, and which clearly works, is one of the best-known tests of the theory itself. 
That all these factors, complex as they are, can be put together to make a reliably operating machine is an enormous triumph of engineering physics. 


Needless to say, the Brookhaven people were eager to build a machine operating on the principle they had invented. 
However, the cosmotron had only recently been finished, and they could not get immediate support for the construction of an even larger machine&emdash;especially one that would use a principle still untested. 
The CERN people, however, were in a much more advantageous position, and in 1953 they began designing the laboratory&#39;s present machine, the CPS (CERN proton synchrotron). 
About six months later, influenced partly by the progress at CERN, the Brookhaven people got under way with the construction of a similar but slightly larger machine&emdash;the AGS, or alternating-gradient synchrotron. 
A friendly race developed between the two groups, with CERN finishing in November, 1959, and Brookhaven about six months later. 


In order to construct the CERN accelerator, Adams gathered around him a superb international team of engineers and physicists interested in accelerator construction. 
Not only is he a brilliant engineer himself but he has the ability to organize other engineers into effective groups with physicists, so that very new ideas can be effectively realized on an industrial scale. 
In fact, working on the accelerator at CERN came to be a considerable distinction for an engineer, and CERN got almost the pick of the European engineers, even though the laboratory could not compete financially with the salaries that were being offered by European industry. 
The machine was so well designed that it worked better than had been generally anticipated. 
It became available to the physicists at CERN early in 1960, and Adams stepped into the gap caused by Bakker&#39;s death to become Director-General of the laboratory for a year. 
He also received an honorary degree from the University of Geneva, which he accepted on behalf of the group that had worked with him. 
He is now back in England directing a laboratory that is studying the problem of controlling nuclear-fusion energy for general application. 
(Nuclear-fusion energy arises when nuclear particles are fused to make a heavier nucleus. 
The heavier nucleus actually weighs less than the sum of its parts, and&emdash;again according to Einstein&#39;s relativity theory&emdash;the excess weight is liberated as energy. 
The hydrogen bomb is an unfortunate application of this principle.) 



<span class="textsc">The</span> present Director-General of CERN is Professor Victor F. Weisskopf, who was given leave of absence from M.I.T. to take over from Adams in 1961. 
Professor Weisskopf, whom I got to know when I was a student at Harvard in the nineteen-fifties, was born in Vienna, so although he is an American citizen, he can be counted as a European. 
He is one of the world&#39;s leading theoretical physicists, as well as one of its most likable. 
A large, friendly man, he is known to almost everybody at CERN as Viki, and despite a recent and very serious automobile accident he remains a devoted skier and hiker. 
This past summer, I had several talks with him about the development of CERN.  
One of the most interesting observations he made had to do with the evolution of the present generation of European physicists. 
At the end of the war, he said, European physics, which had been the finest in the world, was greatly damaged. 
Many of the best European physicists were more or less permanently settled in either England or the United States and had no desire to come back to Europe and relive a very unpleasant experience. 
In particular, the tradition of experimental physics, which requires complicated equipment, had greatly suffered on the Continent during the years of deprivation. 
Consequently, when the big accelerator at CERN was ready, there was a shortage of highly trained European experimenters to use it. 
On the other hand, the war had greatly strengthened physics in the United States, not only because so many Europeans had come he-re to live but because physicists had been working all through the war at places like Los Alamos on subjects that were not entirely dissimilar to their peacetime research. 
Thus, the postwar generation of American physicists was highly trained and ready to continue along the line of research that had made the development of high-energy physics the frontier of physics. 
(Many of the early research papers written at CERN during this period were done by Europeans in collaboration with Americans at the laboratory, some of whom had been born in Europe and were back on visits.) 
Of even greater importance, most of the European physicists who currently have important positions at CERN spent time in the United States, where they received training in the then novel techniques of experimental physics. 
As Weisskopf pointed out, a new generation of excellent and inventive physicists has by now grown up in Europe. 
They are producing scientific work at the forefront of modern physics that is of the first quality and the equal of anything being done in the United States or Russia. 
These physicists are now training young Europeans, to say nothing of American postdoctoral visitors. 
Originally, some European university professors were opposed to the creation of CERN on the ground that it would draw too many scientists away from the universities at a time when there was a desperate shortage of them. 
Weisskopf remarked that it has worked out almost the other way&emdash;that European physicists have come to Geneva for a few years of advanced training and then gone back to their own countries to teach and do research in universities. 
In fact, according to many of the young European physicists I have spoken to, it is now quite hard to find good jobs in European universities, and CERN offers an opportunity to continue working until a suitable position opens up somewhere. 



<span class="textsc">For</span> me, one of the most interesting experiences at CERN was the contact with some of the Russian physicists at the laboratory. 
As a rule, the Russians who come to Geneva are about equally divided between experimental and theoretical physicists. 
Because high-energy experimental physics is done by teams, the experimental physicists join a group of other experimenters, while the theorists work pretty much alone. 
As it happened, one of the Russian experimenters&emdash;Vitaly Kaftanov, from the Institute for Experimental and Theoretical Physics, in Moscow&emdash;was working on an experiment that was of special interest to me, since I had been studying some of its theoretical implications. 
This experiment&emdash;one of the most elaborate and active at CERN&emdash;involves the study of reactions induced by neutrinos. 
The neutrino is a marvellous particle. 
It is almost impossible to detect directly, for it has no charge and no mass, and it interacts very weakly with ordinary matter. 
Indeed, someone has estimated that if one took a single neutrino produced in the accelerator at CERN or the one at Brookhaven (where the first high-energy neutrino experiments were done) and shot it through a layer of lead about as thick as the distance from here to Pluto, it would undergo only one collision during its entire passage. 
Fortunately, however, the experimenter is not limited to one neutrino; an accelerator produces millions of them a second, and some are bound to make a collision in a target of reasonable size. 
These collisions produce particles that can be seen, so that neutrino reactions can be studied. 
Since the collisions are so rare, the whole experimental area must be carefully shielded from cosmic rays and other annoying background that could be confused with the few events that one is looking for. 
In the experiments both at CERN and at Brookhaven, this required literally thousands of tons of heavy shielding material. 
(The shielding in the Brookhaven experiment was made from the remnants of an obsolete battleship, while at CERN it consists of steel ingots lent to the laboratory by the Swiss government from its strategic stockpile.) 
At both CERN and Brookhaven, neutrino events nave been successfully detected; in fact, in the Brookhaven experiment it was first shown that there are two quite distinct species of neutrino. 
Until that experiment, the neutrino was generally taken to be a single, unique particle (although there were some theoretical conjectures to the contrary). 
The fact that precision experiments can now be done with neutrinos is a very important breakthrough in the technology of experimental physics, and it is only natural that a physicist like Kaftanov is eager to work on the project.


Kaftanov, who is married and has a young son, first came to CERN alone. 
This past summer, he was joined by his family. 
He has a warm, friendly personality and a good command of English. 
(He told me that when he was young his parents agreed to allow him to give up music lessons, which he hated, on condition that he study English.) 
Many of our conversations concerned the progress of the experiment, but as we got to know each other better we talked a good deal about a physicist&#39;s life in the United States and in Russia. 
In his country, physicists and engineers are at the very top of the social and economic scale, and the disciplines themselves are characterized by a highly didactic style. 
There is a great deal of sharp, sometimes quite personal criticism at all levels. 
Among European physicists, by contrast, there is still some feeling of deference toward the professor or the senior scientist; in fact, some of the European physicists have told me that they were quite taken aback to see Americans and Russians going at each other hammer and tongs in all-out scientific debate at international meetings. 
The Russians have a very active high-energy-physics program, and are well along with the construction of a seventy-billion-electron-volt accelerator at Serpukhov, which will be the largest in the world when it starts operating. 
All the physicists I have spoken with at CERN, including Kaftanov, are very eager for increased East-West cooperation, and hope that the existing political thaw will continue to permit it. 


<span class="textsc">Ultimately</span>, the most important process in a scientific laboratory is the process of constant reciprocal education. 
At CERN, this is facilitated by the layout of the buildings, which are low and long and are joined by a maze of passageways. 
(The buildings are mostly white with a blue trim, which gives them a clean-cut Swiss look.) 
As one walks down the halls, one hears a continual buzz of multilingual conversations about physics. 
There are often knots of physicists in the halls or in the library, which has a few special soundproof rooms with blackboards for informal discussions. 
Everywhere, one gets the impression of people working and arguing with each other, and this extends even to the cafeteria. 
There is a long lunch period at CERN (the working day is from eight-thirty to five-thirty, and for many of the experimenters, who work in shifts on the accelerator, it runs into the evenings and weekends), and during it everything closes down&emdash;the bank, the post office, the machine shops, and the rest.  
But the talk goes on. 
The cafeteria is furnished with long tables, and by some sort of informal tradition the technical personnel tend to eat at noon, while the physicists eat at one. 
Usually, the experimental groups eat together and the theorists, too, form groups, sometimes according to language and sometimes according to common interests in physics. 
After lunch, dessert and coffee are served at a small bar, and everyone spends the rest of the lunch hour in the lounge over coffee or, on sunny days, on the broad terrace in front of the cafeteria, from which one has a fine view of Mont Blanc. 
Everywhere one looks, there are people discussing physics, sometimes with paper and pencil, sometimes with elaborate gesticulations, and usually in two or three languages. 
It is the time of day when one hears the latest technical gossip, both from CERN and from laboratories around the world. 


In addition to this informal process of education, there are more formal lecture courses and seminars. 
The summer before last, I attended a lecture series, given especially for physicists, on using electronic computers. 
Surprisingly, most of the computer use at CERN and at other high-energy-physics laboratories is not by theoretical physicists but by experimenters. 
A typical experiment involves placing a target, such as a bubble chamber filled with liquid hydrogen or liquid helium, in front of the beam of particles emerging from the accelerator. 
The particles leave tracks in the liquid, and these tracks are photographed&emdash;a process likely to involve photographing hundreds of thousands of tracks from several angles. 
Then the photographs, which often look like examples of abstract art, must be &ldquo;scanned;&rdquo; that is, the events of special interest must be distinguished from the inevitable chaotic background. 
Much of this scanning is done&emdash;visually, in the first instance&emdash;by a large group of people, mostly women. 
The scanners do not have to be physicists, since picking out events of interest is a question of pattern recognition and can be taught to almost anyone. 
After the events have been roughly selected, they must be &ldquo;measured.&rdquo;
The curvature and thickness of the tracks as well as the angles between them are determined, to see whether the event in question is really what one is looking for or is perhaps something that looks similar but is really quite different. 
These distinctions are made with the help of a computer, which is programmed to correlate the results of the measurements, try to fit the event with various hypotheses, and then report back. 
Without a computer, this procedure would be enormously time-consuming, since many possibilities must be explored in each photograph, and there are thousands of photographs to study. 
Moreover, some devices that make possible a partial automation of the measuring process are now in use&emdash;an operator sets a crosshair on a track, and the machine does the rest of the measuring automatically, feeding the results into the computer&emdash;and there are systems under development that in certain cases will do the pattern recognition automatically. 
Hence, one can imagine a time when computers will study all the pictures and deliver carefully analyzed experimental curves to the researcher. 
The amount of computing required for such work is tremendous. 
CERN has recently bought the largest computer in the world and will install it at the end of this year, to replace the present equipment, which is completely saturated. 


This past summer, I attended two courses given by theoretical physicists especially for the experimenters at the laboratory. 
There is a communication problem between experimental and theoretical physicists that arises from the increasing need to specialize in a single aspect of physics because of the complexity of the field. 
The old-fashioned romantic notion of the experimenter coming into the physics laboratory in his white coat, with his mind unburdened by preconceptions or theoretical fancies, and saying to himself, &ldquo;Well, what am I going to discover today?&rdquo; just doesn&#39;t apply to experimental high-energy physics. 
The probable theoretical implications of experiments are carefully considered in advance. 
Recently, in an editorial in Physical Review Letters, a journal that specializes in the rapid publication of important new results in physics. 
Dr. S. A. Goudsmit commented, somewhat ironically, &ldquo;At present, most experiments are only undertaken to prove or disprove a theory. 
In fact, some experimental teams employ a theorist somewhat in the role of a court astrologer, to tell them whether the stars in the theoretical heavens favor the experiments they are planning.&rdquo; 


In any case, an experimenter must have a knowledge of the latest theoretical results and how they bear on his work. 
Thus, one of the jobs of the theoreticians at CERN is to explain what is happening in their fields. 
One of the special courses, given by Professor Leon Van Hove, a Belgian physicist (formerly of Utrecht, Holland) who directs the theoretical group at <span class="textsc">CERN</span>, presented an especially lucid review of general aspects of reactions at high energies, but this course was finishing for the summer when I arrived, so I could attend only the last few lectures. 
The other course, given by Professor Bernard d&#39;Espagnat, a French theorist from Paris, was concerned with some of the most exciting ideas that have come along in elementary-particle physics for several years. 
These ideas have to do with what is known as &ldquo;unitary symmetry,&rdquo; or, less accurately, &ldquo;the eightfold way.&rdquo;
To understand what they signify, one must go back into the history of the subject a bit. 


In the past few years, more and more new particles have been discovered in experiments with the accelerators. 
These particles are characterized by, among other properties, their masses, their electric charges, and&emdash;because they are in general unstable&emdash;their lifetimes. 
The major problem the particles have presented has been whether they have any interconnections or are completely independent units. 
In this area, atomic physics furnishes an especially encouraging example, since a superficial look at the array of chemical elements and their diverse properties might lead one to conclude that they could have no connections with one another. 
However, it is well known that all atoms are composed of only three distinct types of particle&emdash;the proton and the neutron, which form the atomic nucleus, and the electron, a light, negatively charged particle that generates a cloud of negative charge around the nucleus. 
The number and distribution of the electrons determine the chemical properties of a given atom, and the protons and neutrons determine its mass. 
In the case of the so-called elementary particles, one may ask the same sort of question: Is there a simple basic set of elementary particles from which all the others can be constructed? 
Or, as the question has sometimes been phrased: Are some elementary particles more elementary than others, and can the rest be made up of the most elementary ones? 
It is quite possible that this question has no real answer. 
Observations made with the aid of bubble chambers and other detection devices show that, in accordance with certain general rules, elementary particles can be transformed into one another in high-energy reactions. 
For example, if a pi-meson from an accelerator bombards a liquid-hydrogen target, there can be reactions in which the pi-meson and the proton that composes the liquid-hydrogen nucleus disappear and out come a so-called K-meson and another particle, called a lambda. 
Thus, the system of pi-meson and proton is transformed into K-meson and lambda. 
In accounting for this transformation, one may think of the proton as being made up of a K-meson and a lambda, or one may think of the lambda as being made up of a proton and a K-meson, or one may think of all these particles as elementary. 
Many physicists have come to believe that the choice among these possibilities is a matter of convenience, to be decided only by which choice leads to the simplest and most beautiful theory. 
It has recently become clear that all known particles can be thought of as being made up of three basic particles, and this way of looking at them appears to be the simplest possible. 
The basic set has not yet actually been seen, and one of the great tasks of light energy experimental physics in the next few years will be to search for new particles that may be candidates for the basic ones. 
The search has already started at CERN and Brookhaven. 
The term &ldquo;eightfold way&rdquo; derives from the fact that the particles composed of the basic threes fall naturally into groups of eights (in some cases, into groups of tens) that have closely interconnected properties. 
There is now very solid evidence that these groupings exist, and if the basic set of threes is identified, this will close one of the most fascinating investigations of elementary-particle physics. 


<span class="textsc">After</span> one of Professor d&#39;Espagnat&#39;s lectures, on a particularly warm and lovely summer&#39;s day, I decided to take a walking tour of the CERN site. 
At different times over the years, I had visited most of the installations, but for the fun of it I thought I would make the whole round in one swoop. 
The laboratory is surrounded by gentle rolling fields leading off to the Jura, the wooded, glacially formed foothills of the Alps; in fact, during the winter, people from CERN often spend their lunch hour skiing in the Jura, which are only a few minutes away by car. 
When I left the building where the theoreticians have their offices, the first thing that struck me was the construction work going on everywhere&emdash;laborers (most of them Spaniards and Italians, as is the case in all of Switzerland) were enlarging roads and erecting new buildings. 
Alongside one of the roads I saw a striking silvered bubble&emdash;a safety tank for holding hydrogen. 
Hydrogen, which is the most popular target for experiments, because of its simplicity, is also one of the most difficult gases to handle, because of its explosive nature, and there is a whole complex of installations at CERN devoted to processing and handling it, all of them plastered with multilingual signs telling one not to smoke. 
A little farther on, I came to one of three &ldquo;halls&rdquo; in which experiments are actually done. 
As the proton beam runs around its track, it produces particles in targets, and these can be siphoned off at various stages and directed into one of the halls; this was the East Hall. 
I am not very enthusiastic about attempts to romanticize science and scientists, but there is something romantic about a high-energy experimental laboratory. 
Its attraction lies partly in the complexity and diversity of the equipment&emdash;giant magnets, trucks filled with liquefied gases, wonderful-looking electronic devices that flash lights of every color&emdash;and partly in the knowledge that what is being studied lies at the very heart of the composition of the world. 
There was almost total silence in the East Hall, broken only by the rhythmic booming of the main magnet of the accelerator and the constant hum of electric motors. 
(CERN uses almost ten per cent of Geneva&#39;s entire power supply.) 
I stood in awe until someone came up and asked if I was looking for something. 
For want of anything better, I told him that I had got lost while trying to find the road leading to the center of the accelerator ring. 
He gave me some directions. 
I walked outside and quickly found it. 
The ring is buried, and one can see its outline as a slight circular mound raised above the fields. 
The center of the ring is guarded by fences and signs warning against radioactivity and barring entry to anyone without permission. 
This day, though, I noticed a number of men inside the ring cutting the grass; the machine was undoubtedly off while they were working. 
I crossed over and went below ground into the central building. 
Inside, equipment sprawled everywhere, and there was a faint smell of resin, which is used in soldering electrical circuits. 
Dozens of men in laboratory coats were working at one job or another with great concentration. 
As I watched them, the title of a book on mountain-climbing came to mind&emdash;&ldquo;Les Conquerants de I&#39;lnutile.&rdquo; 
In a way, high-energy physics is &ldquo;la conqucte de I&#39;inutile&rdquo; but it is also one of the most exciting, benign, and revealing intellectual disciplines that man has been able to devise.
