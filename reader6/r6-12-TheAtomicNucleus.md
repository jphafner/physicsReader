Ever since 1930, when the discovery of the neutron made it plain that the nuclei of atoms were built of protons and neutrons, physicists have been trying to form a picture of the structure of the nucleus. 
The same task for the rest of the atom was completed in the first quarter of this century. 
We were able to understand in detail how the electrons move under the attraction of the nucleus, and how their motion is influenced by their mutual repulsion. 


To achieve such an understanding requires three major steps: First, we must know the forces between the particles. 
Second, we need to know the mechanical laws which govern their motion under the influence of these forces. 
Third, we need in most cases a simplified picture, or model, from which to start. 
Once we have the first two ingredients, we could in principle write down a set of mathematical equations whose solutions would tell us all about the atom, or about the nucleus. 
In the simplest possible atoms, like that of hydrogen, in which there is only one electron, or in the simplest compound nuclei, like the deuteron, which contains only one proton and one neutron, such equations can be written down and solved without difficulty.
However, for more complicated structures this head-on attack becomes much harder and soon exceeds the capacity even of modern electronic computers. 


We are like men who encounter for the first time a complicated machine, and who try to analyze its operation. 
If we attempt, without any guidance, to puzzle out the interplay of all the parts of the machine, we should soon lose ourselves in a maze. 
Instead, we first try to ascertain the major features of the machine&#39;s operation. 
We then devise a model which resembles the real thing in these features, yet is simple enough to be analyzed. 
Then, of course, we must put in corrections for the complications which we have left out and check that they do not materially alter the picture. 


In the study of the atom the first of the three steps hardly presented a problem. 
As soon as Ernest Rutherford had demonstrated that the atom consisted of a heavy, positively charged nucleus and of light, negatively charged electrons, it was taken for granted that the forces between them were the electric attraction of unlike charges, following the inverse-square law familiar to every student of physics. 
The major difficulty was the second step. 
It turned out that the basic mechanical principles of Isaac Newton, which applied to all &ldquo;large&rdquo; objects from the planets and the moon down to steam engines and watches, had to be revised in the atomic domain. 
To understand atoms we had to use the new ideas of the quantum theory, following the pioneer work of Niels Bohr, who adapted for this purpose the concept of the quantum of action which Max Planck had first found in the behavior of light. 
These new laws of mechanics were later formulated as the laws of &ldquo;quantum mechanics,&rdquo; or &ldquo;wave mechanics,&rdquo; which gave us complete command over the theory of the atom. 


The third step, of finding a simplified model for discussing the atom, also proved relatively easy. 
In working out the possible orbits of a single electron under the attraction of a proton, as in the hydrogen atom, Bohr found that one could account for the behavior of a more complex atom by assuming that each of its electrons moved in such an orbit.
The larger the number of electrons in an atom, however, the more distinct orbits they occupy; this is a consequence of the &ldquo;exclusion principle&rdquo; discovered by Wolfgang Pauli, which limits the number of electrons that can travel in a given orbit. 


We must allow not only for the attraction of the electrons by the nucleus, but also for the repulsion of the electrons by one another. 
However, we simplify the nature of this repulsion by forgetting that it changes continuously as the electrons move around in their orbits, and treating it as a fixed field of force. 
In other words, we replace the repulsion due to a moving electron by that which we would obtain if the electron were spread out evenly over its orbit. 
This simplification can be justified by the fact that the repulsion acts over relatively long distances, so that each electron is at any time under the influence of several others. 
If we underestimate the effect of one of the electrons which may happen to be rather close to the one we are looking at, we are likely to overestimate the effect of another which happens to be rather far away. 


This model of the atom is usually called the &ldquo;shell model,&rdquo; because it is convenient to group together the electrons moving in orbits of similar size but of different shape and direction. 
Such a group of orbits is called a shell. 


When the atomic nucleus first became an object of serious study, the nature of the difficulties was rather different. 
The general laws of dynamics did not seem to require further revision; the laws of quantum mechanics which had been discovered in atomic physics seemed quite adequate for the nuclear domain. 
Indeed, we have not yet found any evidence in the behavior of nuclei which would suggest that these laws might be in error. 
Thus the second step in our list presented no problem. 


## The Nuclear Forces


On the other hand the first step&emdash;the determination of the forces between the particles&emdash;proved to be a very difficult problem. 
Even today, after some 25 years of intense study, we cannot claim to have a complete answer, but we have by now at least a fair knowledge of what the forces are like. 


They cannot be electric in origin. 
The only electric charges found in the nucleus are the positive charges of the protons, and like charges repel each other; thus electric forces cannot be responsible for holding a nucleus together. 
Moreover, electric forces are much too weak. 
We know that the energy of attraction of two unlike charges (i.e., the work we have to do to pull them apart) varies inversely as their distance. 
The attractive energy of an electron and a proton in the hydrogen atom is a few electron volts (eV), and since the diameter of the hydrogen atom is \num{20 000} times larger than that of the smallest nucleus we should expect electric energies in the nucleus to amount to some tens of thousands of electron volts. 
Actually the forces inside a nucleus run to many million electron volts (MeV).
It follows that nuclear forces are vastly stronger than electric forces. 


It is also clear that these strong forces act only over extremely short distances. 
The pioneer work of Rutherford on the passage of charged particles through matter showed that, even in encounters in which a charged particle approaches a nucleus to a distance of a few times the nuclear diameter, the only noticeable force is the electric one. 
We know today that nuclear forces between two particles are quite negligible if the distance between the particles is more than, say, four fermis. 
(The fermi, named for the late Enrico Fermi, is a convenient unit of distance for the nucleus. 
The diameter of a heavy nucleus is some 15 fermis the diameter of the hydrogen atom, about 100,000 fermis.)
It is not surprising, therefore, that earlier physicists did not meet nuclear forces in laboratory experiments. 
The only possible way of studying these forces is to observe the behavior of nuclei, or to bombard hydrogen or other nuclei with fast protons or neutrons under circumstances in which the effect of really close encounters can show up. 


What makes this task harder is that the nature of nuclear forces, unlike the simple inverse-square law of electric or gravitational forces, is rather complicated. 
If the law of nuclear forces were simple, a few observations might suffice to guess its general form. 
But all simple guesses based on a few experiments have been disproved by later experiments. 
We are obliged to reconstruct the law of nuclear forces laboriously from the various pieces of evidence we can extract from the experiments. 


Ultimately we hope to be able to derive the law of the forces from more basic principles, just as we can derive the inverse-square law of electric forces from the basic laws of electromagnetism. 
A beginning was made by the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa, who used the analogy with electromagnetic radiation to point out that nuclear forces must be related to a new form of radiation which could carry charged particles weighing a few hundred times more than the electron. 
His prediction was confirmed by the discovery of the so-called pi meson. 
His picture of the mechanism underlying the nuclear forces has been qualitatively confirmed by many observations, and has been a useful guide in our thinking about the forces. 
But it has not yet been possible to use his idea for a reliable and accurate derivation of the law of the forces because of the mathematical problems which stand in the way. 
We do not know today whether a correct solution of the equations embodying Yukawa&#39;s idea would yield the right forces, or whether there is something basically wrong with this approach. 
The difficulties arise chiefly from the greater strength of the nuclear forces, as compared to electric forces, which makes their mathematical analysis much more difficult.

}
</figure>


Thus the best source of information about the forces still lies in direct experiments. 
These require collisions at high energies&emdash;much higher than the energies of particles inside ordinary nuclei. 
The reason for this is the wave aspect of particles, which is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. 
Slow particles are associated with waves of long wavelength, and collisions involving such slow particles do not provide much information about the finer features of the forces at work between them, just as in looking through a microscope at a dust particle with a diameter less than a wavelength of light we see only a general blur which does not reveal the shape or nature of the particle. 
To have particles of sufficiently short wavelength one must raise their energy to a few hundred MeV. 
The most reliable information on nuclear forces has therefore become available only in the last few years, as a consequence of the development of accelerating machines which produce clean beams of protons, neutrons, or electrons with such energies. 
This need for high-energy beams is entirely similar to the situation in atomic physics, where detailed pictures of the structure of atoms require the use of X-ray or electron beams of several thousand eV&emdash;much greater than the energies of the electrons inside the atoms, whose wavelength is comparable to the atomic diameter. 
The complexity of the results has also made it necessary to call on the services of fast electronic computers for disentangling the observations. 


I shall not attempt in this article to give anything like a complete specification of the nuclear forces, but shall stress only those features which are of importance for what follows. 
We have already noted that the forces must be strong and of short range. 
Since they hold the different particles together, they must on balance be attractive. 
At the same time they cannot be entirely attractive, since otherwise heavy nuclei would &ldquo;collapse.&rdquo; 
By collapse we mean a state of affairs in which all the particles in a nucleus are so close together that each one is within the range of the attractive force of every other. 
In that case the attractive energy acting on each particle would grow with the total number of particles present, and the volume occupied by the whole nucleus would be the same no matter how many particles were in it. 
This is not found in reality. 
The energy per particle is roughly the same for all nuclei, light or heavy, and the volume of nuclei increases with the number of particles in them. 


## The Exchange Forces


This behavior, which indicates a limited attraction, is usually called &ldquo;saturation&rdquo; of the nuclear forces. 
There are two particularly plausible ideas to account for this saturation. 
One was suggested by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, who was one of the founders of quantum mechanics. 
He postulated that at least part of the nuclear forces between a neutron and a proton involves an exchange of their position, so that after an encounter between them the neutron would tend to follow what had been the path of the proton, and vice versa. 
The exchange occurs readily only if the two move in very similar orbits, and, since the Pauli exclusion principle allows only a limited number of particles to follow the same orbit, such exchange forces would expose each particle to a strong attraction only from a few others. 
The bombardment of protons with fast neutrons confirmed this idea, because it showed that in most cases either the neutron or the proton tended to go forward with almost the same speed and direction with which the neutron had arrived. 
Since it is hard to deflect such fast particles from their path, this indicates that the incident neutron had continued almost in a straight line, but that in half the collisions it had changed its nature and become a proton, leaving a neutron behind. 

However, the experiment also showed that only one half of the force was of the exchange type; the other half (corresponding to the neutrons still moving forward after collision) was an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; force. 
This is not enough to yield the required saturation, and some other factor must be involved. 
The second factor tending toward saturation is almost certainly a reversal of the direction of the nuclear forces at short distances, so that, as two particles approach each other, the attraction changes to repulsion. 
This concept of &ldquo;repulsive cores&rdquo; in the forces is familiar in the behavior of atoms. 
When atoms form chemical compounds, or liquid or solid substances, they are held together by attractive forces; but each atom has a fairly definite size, and when two atoms come into actual contact, their attraction changes into repulsion. 
We may liken this behavior to that of two rubber balls tied together with a rubber band. 
There is an attraction between the balls, but there is also a contact force which prevents the centers of the balls from approaching each other closer than one diameter. 
Shortly after the theoretical need for such a repulsive core in the nuclear forces had become clear, experiments on collisions between fast particles indeed showed direct evidence for these repulsive forces. 


Among other features of the nucleus I should mention the &ldquo;spin-orbit&rdquo; force, that is, the dependence of the mutual interaction of two particles upon the direction of their orbit with respect to their spin. 
When the two particles spin on their axes in the same direction as that in which they revolve about each other, the attraction between them is stronger; when they spin in the opposite direction from that in which they revolve, the attraction is weaker. 
There is some evidence for such a spin-orbit force in experiments on nuclear collisions, but there is still some room for controversy in the interpretation of these experiments. 


Our present knowledge of the nuclear forces, while still incomplete, is sufficient to discuss the behavior of nuclei and the collisions between them.
At this point we meet the need for the third step in our general program, namely a simple model in terms of which we may approach the dynamical problem of the motion of the 16 particles in the oxygen nucleus, or the 208 particles in the most stable lead nucleus.

## Models of the Nucleus


The selection of a suitable model is not at all straightforward. 
Not that there is a shortage of suggestions. 
In fact the trouble in the recent past has been a surfeit of different models, each of them successful in explaining the behavior of nuclei in some situations, and each in apparent contradiction with other successful models or with our ideas about nuclear forces. 
In the past few years great progress has been made in bringing some order into this confusion and in understanding the justification for each of the models in the domain to which it is properly applied. 
I shall attempt to explain briefly some of the ideas behind these developments. 


The most obvious idea was to use the shell model, which had been so successful in dealing with the atom. 
In fact, the first attempts to set up such a shell model were made even before the discovery of the neutron, when it was believed that nuclei were made of protons and electrons. 
A shell model with the wrong constituents cannot have much success in accounting for the facts, but in those days rather few facts were known, so such models were able to survive for some time. 


After the discovery of the neutron, attempts to formulate a nuclear shell-model were renewed. 
This involved the idea of orbits (or quantum states) for the protons and neutrons, in which each of them was pictured as moving independently under the influence of some force which represented the average effect of the others, as in the case of the electrons in the atom. 
It did not seem possible, however, to choose groups of orbits of the right kind, so that the number of similar orbits which formed a shell could accommodate just the right number of neutrons and protons to account for the exceptional stability of nuclei with certain numbers (&ldquo;magic numbers&rdquo;) of neutrons or protons. 


The same idea was applied to the collision of neutrons with nuclei. 
According to the shell model, the impinging neutron should travel through the nucleus on its own orbit, as through some field of force, and individual encounters with the particles constituting the target nucleus ought to be rare and unimportant. 
Hence the neutron should in most cases emerge with the same speed as that with which it entered, and only rarely should it get trapped. 
The details of the process should not depend critically on the speed of the neutron. 


Observations of such collisions, initiated by Fermi in Rome, gave a completely different picture. 
Most of the neutrons that interacted with a nucleus were trapped, their excess energy being radiated in the form of gamma rays. 
Moreover, the chance of the neutron being affected by the nucleus depended very critically on its energy. 
One found a large number of resonances, i.e., sharply selected energies, for which a neutron was sure to be picked up by the nucleus. 
For each target nucleus there are many such resonances, the energy difference between them being often as low as 100 eV, an exceedingly small difference on the nuclear scale. 


These resonances turned out to be exceedingly sharp, and on the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics a sharply defined energy is associated with a long time. 
So it follows that once a neutron gets into a nucleus in conditions of resonance it must stay there a long time —much longer than it would take it to cross a region the size of a nucleus. 


## The Liquid-Drop Model


The way to resolve these apparent contradictions was pointed out by Bohr. 
He recognized that it was not right to think of a neutron as passing just through a general field of force, since the nucleus is densely packed with particles which each exert strong forces on the extra neutron as well as on each other. 
Instead of comparing the process with the passage of a comet through the solar system, as was appropriate for the passage of an electron through an atom, we should liken it to the entry of a golf ball into a space already fairly densely filled with similar balls. 
The result will be a complicated motion of all the balls, and the energy of motion of the extra one will rapidly get shared with the others. 


The dynamical problem is now that of a true many-body motion, and we have vastly more possibilities of varying the details of the motion of all the particles. 
This means that the rules of quantum mechanics will give us far more states of motion, and these are responsible for the greatly increased number of resonances. 
We also see the reason for the long stay of the neutron in the nucleus, because when the energy of motion is shared among many particles, none of them can attain enough speed to escape from the general attraction. 
It must take a long time before by chance one of them collects enough of the available energy to get away. 
In our picture of the golf balls this will actually never happen, because in the meantime too much of the energy will have been dissipated in friction. 
In the nuclear case the analogue of friction is the loss of energy by gamma radiation, and this is responsible for the events in which the neutron gets trapped. 
But it is less effective than in the case of the golf balls, and some neutrons do get out again.

    A bombarding particle (upper right) has energy to spare; thus it can exchange energy with a particle in nucleus and move it to orbit of higher energy. 
}
</figure>


The physicist does not invoke here the similarity with a system of golf balls, which is not quite close enough, but he is reminded of a very similar situation which arises when a water molecule hits a drop of water, and for this reason Bohr&#39;s model is often called the &ldquo;liquid-drop model.&rdquo; 


The liquid-drop model met with considerable success, and was able to explain many detailed features of nuclear reactions. 
At this time it seemed evident that the whole earlier idea of the shell model, which pictures the particles as moving independently, was doomed to failure, in view of the high density of the nucleus and the strong forces a particle was bound to experience in many encounters with others during the course of its motion. 
Most physicists then regarded the whole idea of a shell model as misconceived, but some, whether out of a stubborn refusal to accept the arguments against the model, or out of a deeper intuitive insight which convinced them that somehow one might be able to get around the argument, continued to look at the behavior of nuclei in their normal states in terms of shells.

</figure>


## The Shell Model Again


It soon became evident that there was overwhelming evidence in favor of such a shell picture, and the final success came when Maria G. Mayer of the University of Chicago and J. D. H. Jensen of Heidelberg independently noticed that the facts fitted amazingly well with a slightly modified shell model. 
The new feature was that when a particle spins in the direction in which it moves about the center of the nucleus, its orbit is different from the orbit of a particle spinning in the opposite direction. 
When this idea was put forward, it was not known that the force between two particles depends on the relative orientation of spin and orbit. 
Today the idea appears entirely natural. With this refinement, such a mass of data about the behavior of nuclei could be explained that there remained no doubt as to the essential of the particle being absorbed, i.e., lost from the beam of bombarding neutrons [see &ldquo;A Model of the Nucleus,&rdquo; by Victor F. Weisskopf and E. P. Rosenbaum; Scientific American, December, 1955]. 
How can we understand the success of this picture of independent particle motion in view of the Bohr argument? 


The answer to this question has been given in essence by Weisskopf. 
It may be expressed by considering the time sequence of events. 
To be sure, the bombarding particle is likely to be disturbed from its path by collisions, but this will take a little time. 
So for a short time it will penetrate into the nucleus on a regular orbit, and this initial period is important for determining whether it will actually get deep inside or be turned back at the surface. 
Now, to recall once again the uncertainty principle, we know that in talking about a short time interval we must not try to specify the energy too accurately. 
We should therefore think not of neutrons with a well-defined energy, but of a beam of neutrons varying in energy by an amount that is greater the shorter the time in which they are likely to be involved in collisions inside the nucleus. 
Experiments often make use of such mixed beams, if the experimenter does not take trouble to select the neutron energies accurately. 
If we have data with accurate energy selection we should lump together the observations over a suitable range of energies. 


<figure>

    The neutrons are produced by the Brookhaven nuclear reactor, the concrete shield of which is visible at right. 
    The oxygen atoms are contained in the long tank in the middle of the picture. 
    The neutrons which are not absorbed are counted in the shorter tank at lower left. 
}
</figure>


Then we do not see the sharp resonances any more because there will always be many of them within the energy range we use. 
The result we get in this way will reflect the number and strength of the resonances within the selected range. 
But we may now think of these results also as determined by the first short time interval of the event, and as the neutron pursues a regular orbit during this short time interval the results now should reflect the behavior of such regular orbits. 
This therefore leads us directly to the picture of the optical model, which has neutrons traveling in regular orbits. 
The absorption which was allowed for in Weisskopf&#39;s optical model merely reflects the fact that the particles do not stay on such a regular orbit forever, but are sooner or later removed from it by collisions with other particles. 
The strength of this absorption is thus related to the rate at which collisions occur inside the nucleus. If they are very frequent, so that the particle covers only a small fraction of the nuclear diameter before it hits something, the &ldquo;giant resonances,&rdquo; which correspond to the orbits of a single particle, will become weaker and more diffuse. 
The fact that they are found to be pronounced and distinct shows that the particle has a fair chance of completing at least one revolution in its orbit. 
In this respect we see that the extreme form of Bohr&#39;s liquid-drop model, or our simple picture of golf balls, exaggerates the situation. 
But we have succeeded in reconciling Bohr&#39;s explanation of the many sharp resonances in terms of the many-body aspects of the problem, with the superimposed structure of giant resonances, which characterize the early stages of the process. 


It remains to account for the quantitative features of the optical model&emdash;and in particular for the long time a particle can stay in its orbit before being thrown out of it by a close encounter with another particle&emdash;in terms of the basic forces. 
A promising attack on this problem is now under way. 
The workers engaged in it include G. E. Brown in the author&#39;s group at the University of Birmingham. 
In particular, the low rate of collisions is seen to be linked again with the effect of the exclusion principle. 
We have seen that this cuts down the rate of collisions in a normal nucleus drastically. 
In the impact problems where there is more energy to spare, the collisions are more frequent, because there are more orbits available that are not already occupied, but the prohibition is still partly effective and the collision rate is still a good deal less than that suggested by the picture of golf balls, for which all quantum effects, including the exclusion principle, are of no importance. 


A picture thus emerges in which the various, apparently contradictory, models of the nucleus are seen as consistent parts of a whole, each appropriate for answering certain questions about the behavior of nuclei. 
There are problems for which yet other models have to be used, including the important &ldquo;collective model&rdquo; developed by Aage Bohr and B. Mottelson of Copenhagen, but it would exceed the scope of this article to describe them and show how they fit into the story.
