In this article I should like to discuss the development of general physical theory: how it developed in the past and how one may expect it to develop in the future. 
One can look on this continual development as a process of evolution, a process that has been going on for several centuries. 


The first main step in this process of evolution was brought about by Newton. 
Before Newton, people looked on the world as being essentially two-dimensional&emdash;the two dimensions in which one can walk about&emdash;and the up-and-down dimension seemed to be something essentially different. 
Newton showed how one can look on the up-and-down direction as being symmetrical with the other two directions, by bringing in gravitational forces and showing how they take their place in physical theory. 
One can say that Newton enabled us to pass from a picture with two-dimensional symmetry to a picture with three-dimensional symmetry. 


%% Newthought
Einstein made another step in the same direction, showing how one can pass from a picture with three-dimensional symmetry to a picture with four-dimensional symmetry. 
Einstein brought in time and showed how it plays a role that is in many ways symmetrical with the three space dimensions. 
However, this symmetry is not quite perfect. 
With Einstein&#39;s picture one is led to think of the world from a four-dimensional point of view, but the four dimensions are not completely symmetrical. 
There are some directions in the four-dimensional picture that are different from others: directions that arc called null directions, along which a ray of light can move; hence the four-dimensional picture is not completely symmetrical. 
Still, there is a great deal of symmetry among the four dimensions. 
The only lack of symmetry, so far as concerns the ccjuations of physics, is in the appearance of a minus sign in the ecjuations with respect to the time dimension as compared with the three space dimensions [sec top equation on page 8]. 


We have, then, the development from the three-dimensional picture of the world to the four-dimensional picture. 
The reader will probablv not be happy with this situation, because the world still appears three-dimensional to his consciousness. 
How can one bring this appearance into the four-dimensional picture that Einstein re(juires the physicist to have? 


What appears to our consciousness is really a three-dimensional section of the four-dimensional picture. 
We must take a three-dimensional section to give us what appears to our consciousness at one time; at a later time we shall have a different three-dimensional section. 
The task of the physicist consists largely of relating events in one of these sections to events in another section referring to a later time. 
Thus the picture with four-dimensional symmetry does not give us the whole situation. 
This becomes particularly important when one takes into account the developments that have been brought about by quantum theory. 
Quantum theory has taught us that we have to take the process of observation into account, and observations usually require us to bring in the three-dimensional sections of the four-dimensional picture of the universe. 


The special theory of relativity, which Einstein introduced, requires us to put all the laws of physics into a form that displays four-dimensional svmmetry. 
But when we use these laws to get results about observations, we have to bring in something additional to the four-dimensional symmetry, namely the three-dimensional sections that describe our consciousness of the universe at a certain time. 


Einstein made another most important contribution to the development of our physical picture: he put forward the general theory of relativity, which requires us to suppose that the space of physics is curved. 
Before this physicists had always worked with a flat space, the three-dimensional flat space of Newton which was then extended to the four-dimensional flat space of special relativity. 
General relativity mads a really important contribution to the evolution of our physical picture by requiring us to go over to cur\&#39;ed space. 
The general requirements of this theory mean that all the laws of physics can be formulated in curved four-dimensional space, and that they show symmetry among the four dimensions. 
But again, when we want to bring in observ-ations, as we must if we look at things from the point of view of quantum theory, we have to refer to a section of this four-dimensional space. 
With the four-dimensional space curved, any section that we make in it also has to be curved, because in general we cannot give a meaning to a flat section in a curved space. 
This leads us to a picture in which we have to take curved three-dimensional sections in the curv&#39;ed four-dimensional space and discuss observations in these sections. 


During the past few years people have been trying to apply quantum ideas to gravitation as well as to the other phenomena of physics, and this has led to a rather unexpected development, namely that when one looks at gravitational theory from the point of view of the sections, one finds that there are some degrees of freedom that drop out of the theory. 
The gravitational field is a tensor field with 10 components. 
One finds that six of the components are adequate for describing everything of physical importance and the other four can be dropped out of the equations. 
One cannot, however, pick out the six important components from the complete set of 10 in any way that does not destroy the four-dimensional symmetry.
Thus if one insists on preserving four-dimensional symmetry in the equations, one cannot adapt the theory of gravitation to a discussion of measurements in the way quantum theory requires without being forced to a more complicated description than is needed by the physical situation. 
This result has led me to doubt how fundamental the four-dimensional requirement in physics is. 
A few decades ago it seemed quite certain that one had to express the whole of physics in four-dimensional form. 
But now it seems that four-dimensional symmetry is not of such overriding importance, since the description of nature sometimes gets simplified when one departs from it.

Now I should like to proceed to the developments that have been brought about by quantum theory.
Quantum theory is the discussion of very small things, and it has formed the main subject of physics for the past 60 years. 
During this period physicists have been amassing quite a lot of experimental information and developing a theory to correspond to it, and this combination of theory and experiment has led to important developments in the physicist&#39;s picture of the world. 


The quantum first made its appearance when Planck discovered the need to suppose that the energy of electromagnetic waves can exist only in multiples of a certain unit, depending on the frequency of the waves, in order to explain the law of black-body radiation. 
Then Einstein discovered the same unit of energy occurring in the photoelectric effect. 
In this early work on quantum theory one simply had to accept the unit of energy without being able to incorporate it into a physical picture. 


%% Newthought
The first new picture that appeared was Bohr&#39;s picture of the atom. 
It was a pictiu-e in which we had electrons moving about in certain well-defined orbits and occasionally making a jump from one orbit to another. 
We could not picture how the jump took place. 
We just had to accept it as a kind of discontinuity.
Bohr&#39;s pictiire of the atom worked only for special examples, essentially when there was only one electron that was of importance for the problem under consideration. 
Thus the picture was an incomplete and primitive one. 


The big advance in the quantum theory came in 1925, with the discovery of quantiun mechanics. 
This advance was brought about independently by two men, Heisenberg first and Schrodinger soon afterward, working from different points of view. 
Heisenberg worked keeping close to the experimental evidence about spectra that was being amassed at that time, and he found out how the experimental information could be fitted into a scheme that is now known as matrix mechanics. 
All the experimental data of spectroscopy fitted beautifully into the scheme of matrix mechanics, and this led to quite a different picture of the atomic world. 
Schrodinger worked from a more mathematical point of view, trying to find a beautiful theory for describ

know how to calculate results and how to 
compare the results of their calculations 
with experiment. Everyone is agreed on 
the formalism. It works so well that no- 
body can afford to disagree with it. But 
still the picture that we are to set up 
behind this formalism is a subject of 
controversy. 

I should like to suggest that one not 
worry too much about this controversy. I 
feel very strongly that the stage physics 
has reached at the present day is not the 
final stage. It is just one stage in the evo- 
lution of our picture of nature, and we 
should expect this process of evolution 
to continue in the future, as biological 
evolution continues into the future. The 
present stage of physical theory is mere- 
ly a steppingstone toward the better 
stages we shall have in the future. One 
can be quite sure that there will be better 
stages simply because of the difficulties 
that occur in the physics of today. 

T should now like to dwell a bit on 
■*- the difficulties in the physics of the 
present day. The reader who is not an 
expert in the subject might get the idea 
that because of all these difficulties 
physical theory is in pretty poor shape 
and that the quantum theory is not much 
good. I should like to correct this impres- 
sion by saying that quantum theory is an 
extremely good theory. It gives wonder- 
ful agreement with observation over a 
wide range of phenomena. There is no 
dovibt that it is a good theory, and the 
only reason physicists talk so much about 



the difficulties in it is that it is precisely 
the difficulties that are interesting. The 
successes of the theory are all taken for 
granted. One does not get anywhere 
simply by going over the successes again 
and again, whereas by talking over the 
difficulties people can hope to make 
some progress. 

The difficulties in quantum theory are 
of two kinds. I might call them Class One 
difficulties and Class Two difficulties. 
Class One difficulties are the difficulties 
I have already mentioned: How can one 
form a consistent picture behind the 
rules for the present quantum theory? 
These Class One difficulties do not really 
worry the physicist. If the physicist 
knows how to calculate results and com- 
pare them with experiment, he is quite 
happy if the results agree with hi^ ex- 
periments, and that is all he needs. It is 
only the philosopher, wanting to have a 
satisfying description of nature, who is 
bothered by Qass One difficulties. 

There are, in addition to the Class One 
difficulties, the Class Two difficulties, 
which stem from the fact that the present 
laws of quantum theory are not always 
adequate to give any results. If one 
pushes the laws to extreme conditions— 
to phenomena involving very high ener- 
gies or very small distances— one some- 
times gets results that are ambiguous or 
not really sensible at all. Then it is clear 
that one has reached the limits of appli- 
cation of the theory and that some fur- 
ther development is needed. The Class 
Two difficulties are important even for 



the physicist, because they put a limita- 
tion on how far he can use the rules of 
quantum theory to get results compara- 
ble with experiment. 

I should like to say a little more about 
the Class One difficulties. I feel that one 
should not be bothered with them too 
much, because they are difficulties that 
refer to the present stage in the de\&#39;elop- 
ment of our physical picture and are 
almost certain to change with future de- 
velopment. There is one strong reason, I 
think, why one can be quite confident 
that these difficulties will change. There 
are some fundamental constants in na- 
ture: the charge on the electron (desig- 
nated c), Planck&#39;s constant divided by 
2ir (designated h) and the velocity of 
light (c). From these fundamental con- 
stants one can construct a number that 
has no dimensions: the number hc/e&#39;. 
That number is found by experiment to 
have the value 137, or something very 
close to 137. Now, there is no known 
reason why it should have this value 
rather than some other number. Various 
people have put forward ideas about it, 
but there is no accepted theory. Still, 
one can be fairly sure that someday 
physicists will solve the problem and 
explain why the number has this value. 
There will be a physics in the future that 
works when hc/e^ has the value 137 
and that will not work when it has any 
other value. 

The physics of the future, of course, 
cannot have the three quantities h, e and 
c all as fundamental quantities. Only two

of them can be fundamental, and the 
third must be derived from those two. 
It is almost certain that <span class="math">c</span> will be one of the two fundamental ones. 
The velocity of light, <span class="math">c</span>, is so important in the four-dimensional picture, and it plays such a fundamental role in the special theory of relativity, correlating our units of space and time, that it has to be fundamental. 
Then we are faced with the fact that of the two quantities <span class="math">h</span> and <span class="math">e</span>, one will be fundamental and one will be derived. If 
h is fundamental, e will have to be ex- 
plained in some way in terms of the 
square root of h, and it seems most un- 
likely that any fundamental theory can 
give e in terms of a square root, since 
square roots do not occur in basic equa- 
tions. It is much more likely that e will 
be the fundamental quantity and that h 
will be explained in terms of e^. Then 
there will be no square root in the basic 
equations. I think one is on safe ground 
if one makes the guess that in the physi- 
cal picture we shall have at some future 
stage e and c will be fundamental quan- 
tities and h will be derived. 

If h is a derived quantity instead of a 
fundamental one, our whole set of ideas 
about uncertainty will be altered: h is 
the fundamental quantity that occurs in 
the Heisenberg uncertainty relation con- 
necting the amount of uncertainty in a 
position and in a momentum. This un- 
certainty relation cannot play a funda- 
mental role in a theory in which h itself 
is not a fundamental quantity. I think 
one can make a safe guess that uncertain- 
ty relations in their present form will not 
survive in the physics of the future. 

Of course there will not be a return to 
the determinism of classical physi- 
cal theory. Evolution does not go back- 
ward. It will have to go forward. There 
will have to be some new development 
that is quite unexpected, that we cannot 
make a guess about, which will take us 
still further from classical ideas but 
which will alter completely the discus- 
sion of uncertainty relations. And when 
this new development occurs, people 
will find it all rather futile to have had so 
much of a discussion on the role of ob- 
servation in the theory, because they will 
have then a much better point of view 
from which to look at things. So I shall 
say that if we can find a way to describe 
the uncertainty relations and the in- 
determinacy of present quantum me- 
chanics that is satisfying to our philo- 
sophical ideas, we can count ourselves 
lucky. But if we cannot find such a way, 
it is nothing to be really disturbed 
about. We simply have to take into ac- 
count that we are at a transitional stage 



and that perhaps it is quite impossible to 
get a satisfactory picture for this stage. 
I have disposed of the Class One dif- 
ficulties by saying that they are really 
not so important, that if one can make 
progress with them one can count one- 
self lucky, and that if one cannot it is 
nothing to be genuinely disturbed about. 
The Class Two difficulties are the really 
serious ones. They arise primarily from 
the fact that when we apply our quan- 
tum theory to fields in the way we have 
to if we are to make it agree with special 
relativity, interpreting it in terms of the 
three-dimensional sections I have men- 
tioned, we have equations that at first 
look all right. But when one tries to solve 
them, one finds that they do not have any 
solutions. At this point we ought to say 
that we do not have a theory. But physi- 
cists are very ingenious about it, and 
they have found a way to make prog- 
ress in spite of this obstacle. They find 
that when they try to solve the equations, 
the trouble is that certain quantities 
that ought to be finite are actually in- 
finite. One gets integrals that diverge 
instead of converging to something defi- 
nite. Physicists have found that there is a 



way to handle these infinities according 
to certain rules, which makes it possible 
to get definite results. This method is 
known as the renormalization method. 

I shall merely explain the idea in words. 
We start out with a theory involving 
equations. In these equations there occur 
certain parameters: the charge of the 
electron, e, the mass of the electron, m, 
and things of a similar nature. One then 
finds that these quantities, which appear 
in the original equations, are not equal 
to the measured values of the charge and 
the mass of the electron. The measured 
values differ from these by certain cor- 
recting terms— Ae, A"* and so on— so 
that the total charge is c -1- Ac and 
the total mass m + Am. These changes 
in charge and mass are brought about 
through the interaction of our elemen- 
tary particle with other things. Then one 
says that e + Ac and m + A"», being 
the observed things, are the important 
things. The original e and m are just 
mathematical parameters; they are un- 
observable and therefore just tools one 
can discard when one has got far enough 
to bring in the things that one can com-

waves. This photograph was made in 1929, five years after the appearance of his paper.

pare with observation. This would be a 
quite correct way to proceed if /\e 
and A"* were small (or even if they 
were not so small but finite) corrections. 
According to the actual theory, however, 
Ac and A"" are infinitely great. In spite 
of that fact one can still use the formal- 
ism and get results in terms of c + A^ 
and m + A"*, which one can interpret 
by saying that the original e and m have 
to be minus infinity of a suitable amount 
to compensate for the A« and A"» that 
are infinitely great. One can use the 
theory to get results that can be com- 
pared with experiment, in particular for 
electrodynamics. The surprising thing is 
that in the case of electrodynamics one 
gets results that are in extremely good 
agreement with experiment. The agree- 
ment applies to many significant fig- 
ures—the kind of accuracy that previ- 
ously one had only in astronomy. It 
is because of this good agreement that 
physicists do attach some value to the 
renormalization theory, in spite of its 
illogical character. 

It seems to be quite impossible to put 
this theory on a mathematically sound 
basis. At one time physical theory was all 
built on mathematics that was inherently 



sound. I do not say that physicists always 
use sound mathematics; they often use 
unsound steps in their calculations. But 
previously when they did so it was 
simply because of, one might say, lazi- 
ness. They wanted to get results as 
quickly as possible without doing un- 
necessary work. It was always possible 
for the pvu-e mathematician to come 
along and make the theory sound by 
bringing in further steps, and perhaps by 
introducing quite a lot of cumbersome 
notation and other things that are desir- 
able from a mathematical point of view 
in order to get everything expressed 
rigorously but do not contribute to the 
physical ideas. The earlier mathematics 
could always be made sound in that way, 
but in the renormalization theory we 
have a theory that has defied all the at- 
tempts of the mathematician to make it 
sound. I am inclined to suspect that the 
renormalization theory is something that 
will not survive in the future, and that 
the remarkable agreement between its 
results and experiment should be looked 
on as a fluke. 

This is perhaps not altogether surpris- 
ing, because there have been similar 
flukes in the past. In fact, Bohr&#39;s elec-

FOUR-DIMENSIONAL SYMMETRY introduced by the special theory of relativity is not 
quite perfect. This equation is the expression for the invariant distance in four-dimensional 
space-time. The symbol s is the invariant distance; c, the speed of light; t, time; x, y and z, 
the three spatial dimensions. The d&#39;s are differentials. The lack of complete symmetry lies 
in the fact that the contribution from the time direction (c&#39;-dt-) does not have the same 
sign as the contributions from the three spatial directions ( — dx-, — dy- and — dz-) .

SCHRODINGER&#39;S FIRST WAVE EQUATION did not fit experimental results because it 
did not take into account the spin of the electron, which was not known at the time. The 
equation is a generalization of De Broglie&#39;s equation for the motion of a free electron. The 
symbol e represents the charge on the electron; i, the square root of minus one; h, Planck&#39;s 
constant; r, the distance from the nucleus; ^, Schrodinger&#39;s wave function; m, the mass of 
the electron. The symbols resembling sixes turned backward are partial derivatives. 






SCHRODINGER&#39;S SECOND WAVE EQUATION is an approximation to the original 
equation, which does not take into account the refinements that are required by relativity. 



tron-orbit theory was found to give very 
good agreement with observation as long 
as one confined oneself to one-electron 
problems. I think people will now say 
that this agreement was a fluke, because 
the basic ideas of Bohr&#39;s orbit theory 
have been superseded by something 
radically different. I believe the suc- 
cesses of the renormalization theory will 
be on the same footing as the successes 
of the Bohr orbit theory applied to one- 
electron problems. 

&#39; I ^ he renormalization theory has re- 
moved some of these Class Two dif- 
ficulties, if one can accept the illogical 
character of discarding infinities, but it 
does not remove all of them. There are 
a good many problems left over concern- 
ing particles other than those that come 
into electrodynamics: the new particles- 
mesons of various kinds and neutrinos. 
There the theory is still in a primitive 
stage. It is fairly certain that there will 
have to be drastic changes in our funda- 
mental ideas before these problems can 
be solved. 

One of the problems is the one I have 
already mentioned about accounting for 
the number 137. Other problems are 
how to introduce the fundamental length 
to physics in some natural way, how to 
explain the ratios of the masses of the 
elementary particles and how to explain 
their other properties. I believe separate 
ideas wiU be needed to solve these dis- 
tinct problems and that they will be 
solved one at a time through successive 
stages in the future evolution of physics. 
At this point I find myself in disagree- 
ment with most physicists. They are in- 
clined to think one master idea will be 
discovered that will solve all these prob- 
lems together. I think it is asking too 
much to hope that anyone will be able to 
solve all these problems together. One 
should separate them one from- another 
as much as possible and try to tackle 
them separately. And I believe the fu- 
ture development of physics will consist 
of solving them one at a time, and that 
after any one of them has been solved 
there will still be a great mystery about 
how to attack further ones. 

I might perhaps discuss some ideas 
I have had about how one can possibly 
attack some of these problems. None of 
these ideas has been worked out very 
far, and I do not have much hope for any 
one of them. But I think they are worth 
mentioning briefly. 

One of these ideas is to introduce 
something corresponding to the luminif- 
erous ether, which was so popular among 
the physicists of the 19th century. I said 
earlier that physics does not evolve back- 



136 



The Evolution of the Physicist&#39;s Picture of Nature 



ward. \Mien I talk about reintroducing 
the ether, I do not mean to go back to 
the picture of the ether that one had in 
the 19th century, but I do mean to intro- 
duce a new picture of the ether that will 
conform to our present ideas of quantum 
theory. The objection to the old idea of 
the ether was that if you suppose it to 
be a fluid filling up the whole of space, 
in any place it has a definite velocity, 
which destroys the four-dimensional 
symmetry required by Einstein&#39;s special 
principle of relativity. Einstein&#39;s special 
relativity killed this idea of the ether. 

But with our present quantum theor\- 
we no longer have to attach a definite 
velocity to any given physical thing, be- 
cause the velocity is subject to uncer- 
tainty relations. The smaller the mass of 
the thing we are interested in, the more 
important are the uncertainty relations. 
Now, the ether will certainly have very 
little mass, so that uncertainty relations 
for it will be extremely important. The 
velocity of the ether at some particular 
place should therefore not be pictiu-ed as 
definite, because it will be subject to un- 
certainty relations and so may be any- 
thing over a wide range of values. In that 
way one can get over the difficulties of 
reconciling the existence of an ether with 
the special theory of relativity. 

There is one important change this 
will make in our picture of a vacuum. We 
would like to think of a vacuum as a 
region in which we have complete sym- 
metry between the four dimensions of 
space-time as required by special relativ- 
ity. If there is an ether subject to uncer- 
tainty relations, it will not be possible to 
have this symmetry accurately. We can 
suppose that the velocity of the ether is 
equally likely to be anything within a 
wide range of values that would give the 
symmetry only approximately. We can- 
not in any precise way proceed to the 
limit of allowing all values for the veloc- 
ity between plus and minus the velocity 
of light, which we would have to do in 
order to make the symmetry accurate. 
Thus the vacuum becomes a state that is 
unattainable. I do not think that this is a 
physical objection to the theory. It would 
mean that the vacuum is a state we can 
approach very closely. There is no limit 
as to how closely we can approach it, 
but we can never attain it. I believe 
that would be quite satisfactory to the 
experimental physicist. It would, how- 
ever, mean a departure from the notion 
of the vacuum that we have in the 
quantum theory, where we start off with 
the vacuum state having exactly the 
symmetry required by special relativity. 

That is one idea for the development 
of physics in the future that would

idea that waves are assoriated with particles to the electrons moving around the nucleus.

change our picture of the vacuum, but 
change it in a way that is not unaccept- 
able to the experimental physicist. It has 
proved difficult to continue with the 
theory, because one would need to set up 
mathematically the uncertainty relations 
for the ether and so far some satisfactory 
theory along these lines has not been dis- 
covered. If it could be developed satis- 
factorily, it would give rise to a new kind 
of field in physical theory, which might 
help in explaining some of the elemen- 
tary particles. 

A nother possible picture I should like 
-^^ to mention concerns the question of 
why all the electric charges that are ob- 
served in natiure should be multiples of 
one elementary unit, e. Why does one 
not have a continuous distribution of 
charge occurring in nature? The picture 
I propose goes back to the idea of 
Faraday lines of force and involves a 
development of this idea. The Faraday 



lines of force are a way of picturing elec- 
tric fields. If we have an electric field in 
any region of space, then according to 
Faraday we can draw a set of lines that 
have the direction of the electric field. 
The closeness of the lines to one another 
gives a measure of the strength of the 
field— they are close where the field is 
strong and less close where the field is 
weak. The Faraday lines of force give 
us a good picture of the electric field in 
classical theory. 

When we go over to quantum theor&gt;&#39;, 
we bring a kind of discreteness into our 
basic picture. We can suppose that the 
continuous distribution of Faraday lines 
of force that we have in the classical pic- 
ture is replaced by just a few discrete 
lines of force with no lines of force be- 
tween them. 

Now, the lines of force in the Faraday 
picture end where there are charges. 
Therefore with these quantized Faraday 
lines of force it would be reasonable to 



137 



suppose the charge associated with each 
line, which has to lie at the end if the 
line of force has an end, is always the 
same ( apart from its sign ) , apd is al- 
ways just ^ the electronic charge, — c or 
+ e. This leads us to a picture of discrete 
Faraday lines of force, each associated 
with a charge, — e or + e. There is a di- 
rection attached to each line, so that the 
ends of a line that has two ends are not 
the same, and there is a charge + e at 
one end and a charge — e at the other. 
We may have lines of force extending to 
infinity, of course, and then there is no 
charge. 

If we suppose that these discrete 
Faraday lines of force are something 
basic in physics and lie at the bottom of 
our picture of the electromagnetic field, 
we shall have an explanation of why 
charges always occur in multiples of e. 
This happens because if we have any 
particle with some lines of force ending 
on it, the number of these lines must be 
a whole number. In that way we get 
a picture that is qualitatively quite rea- 
sonable. 

We suppose these lines of force can 



move about. Some of them, forming 
closed loops or simply extending from 
minus infinity to infinity, will correspond 
to electromagnetic waves. Others will 
have ends, and the ends of these lines 
will be the charges. We may have a line 
of force sometimes breaking. When that 
happens, we have two ends appearing, 
and there must be charges at the two 
ends. This process— the breaking of a line 
of force— would be the picture for the 
creation of an electron (c ) and a posi- 
tron (e+). It would be quite a reason- 
able picture, and if one could develop it, 
it would provide a theory in which e 
appears as a basic quantity. I have not 
yet found any reasonable system of equa- 
tions of motion for these lines of force, 
and so I just put forward the idea as a 
possible physical picture we might have 
in the future. 

There is one very attractive feature 
in this picture. It will quite alter the 
discussion of renormalization. The re- 
normalization we have in our present 
quantum electrodynamics comes from 
starting off with what people call a bare 
electron— an electron without a charge

on it. At a certain stage in the theory one 
brings in the charge and puts it on the 
electron, thereby making the electron 
interact with the electromagnetic field. 
This brings a perturbation into the equa- 
tions and causes a change in the mass of 
the electron, the A*", which is to be 
added to the previous mass of the elec- 
tron. The procedure is rather roundabout 
because it starts off with the unphysical 
concept of the bare electron. Probably in 
the improved physical picture we shall 
have in the future the bare electron will 
not exist at all. 

Now, that state of affairs is just what 
we have with the discrete lines of force. 
We can picture the lines of force as 
strings, and then the electron in the pic- 
ture is the end of a string. The string it- 
self is the Coulomb force around the 
electron. A bare electron means an elec- 
tron without the Coulomb force around 
it. That is inconceivable with this pic- 
ture, just as it is inconceivable to think of 
the end of a piece of string without think- 
ing of the string itself. This, I think, is the 
kind of way in which we should try to 
develop our physical picture— to bring in 
ideas that make inconceivable the things 
we do not want to have. Again we have a 
picture that looks reasonable, but I have 
not found the proper equations for de- 
veloping it. 

I might mention a third picture with 
which I have been dealing lately. It 
involves departing from the picture of 
the electron as a point and thinking of 
it as a kind of sphere with a finite size. 
Of course, it is really quite an old idea 
to picture the electron as a sphere, but 
previously one had the difficulty of dis- 
cussing a sphere that is subject to ac- 
celeration and to irregular motion. It 
will get distorted, and how is one to deal 
with the distortions? I propose that one 
should allow the electron to have, in 
general, an arbitrary shape and size. 
There will be some shapes and sizes in 
which it has less energy than in others, 
and it will tend to assume a spherical 
shape with a certain size in which the 
electron has the least energy. 

This picture of the extended electron 
has been stimulated by the discovery of 
the mu meson, or muon, one of the new 
particles of physics. The muon has the 
surprising property of being almost iden- 
tical with the electron except in one 
particular, namely, its mass is some 200 
times greater than the mass of the elec- 
tron. Apart from this disparity in mass 
the muon is remarkably similar to the 
electron, having, to an extremely high 
degree of accuracy, the same spin and 
the same magnetic moment in propor- 
tion to its mass as the electron does. This

The Evolution of the Physicist&#39;s Picture of Nature 



leads to the suggestion that the muon 
should be looked on as an excited elec- 
tron. If the electron is a point, picturing 
how it can be excited becomes quite 
awkward. But if the electron is the most 
stable state for an object of finite size, 
the muon might just be the next most 
stable state in which the object under- 
goes a kind of oscillation. That is an idea 
I have been working on recently. There 
are difficulties in the development of this 
idea, in particular the difficulty of bring- 
ing in the correct spin. 

T have mentioned three possible ways 
-•- in which one might think of develop- 
ing our physical picture. No doubt there 
will be others that other people will 
think of. One hopes that sooner or later 
someone will find an idea that really fits 
and leads to a big development. I am 
rather pessimistic about it and am in- 
clined to think none of them will be good 
enough. The future evolution of basic 
physics— that is to say, a development 
that will really solve one of the funda- 
mental problems, such as bringing in the 
fundamental length or calculating the 
ratio of the masses— may require some 
much more drastic change in our physi- 
cal picture. This would mean that in our 
present attempts to think of a new physi- 
cal picture we are setting our imagina- 
tions to work in terms of inadequate 
physical concepts. If that is really the 
case, how can we hope to make progress 
in the future? 

There is one other line along which 
one can still proceed by theoretical 
means. It seems to be one of the funda- 
mental features of nature that funda- 
mental physical laws are described in 
terms of a mathematical theory of great 
beauty and power, needing quite a high 
standard of mathematics for one to un- 
derstand it. You may wonder: Why is 
nature constructed along these lines? 
One can only answer that our present 
knowledge seems to show that nature is 
so constructed. We simply have to accept 
it. One could perhaps describe the situa- 
tion by saying that God is a mathema- 
tician of a very high order, and He used 
very advanced mathematics in construct- 
ing the universe. Our feeble attempts at 
mathematics enable us to understand a 
bit of the universe, and as we proceed 
to develop higher and higher mathe- 
matics we can hope to understand the 
universe better. 

This view provides us with another 
way in which we can hope to make ad- 
vances in our theories. Just by studying 
mathematics we can hope to make a 
guess at the kind of mathematics that 
will come into the physics of the future.

A good many people are working on the 
mathematical basis of quantum theory, 
trying to understand the theory better 
and to make it more powerful and more 
beautiful. If someone can hit on the 
right lines along which to make this de- 
velopment, it may lead to a future ad- 
vance in which people will first discover 
the equations and then, after examining 
them, gradually learn how to apply 
them. To some extent that corresponds 
with the line of development that oc- 
curred with Schrodinger&#39;s discovery of 
his wave equation. Schrodinger discov- 
ered the equation simply by looking for 
an equation with mathematical beauty. 
When the equation was first discovered, 
people saw that it fitted in certain ways, 
but the general principles according to 
which one should apply it were worked 
out only some two or three years later. It 
may well be that the next advance in 
physics will come about along these 
lines: people first discovering the equa- 



tions and then needing a few years of 
development in order to find the physical 
ideas behind the equations. My own be- 
lief is that this is a more likely line of 
progress than trying to guess at physical 
pictures. 

Of course, it may be that even this line 
of progress will fail, and then the only 
line left is the experimental one. Experi- 
mental physicists are continuing their 
work quite independently of theory, col- 
lecting a vast storehouse of information. 
Sooner or later there will be a new 
Heisenberg who will be able to pick out 
the important features of this informa- 
tion and see how to use them in a way 
similar to that in which Heisenberg used 
the experimental knowledge of spectra 
to build his matrix mechanics. It is in- 
evitable that physics will develop ulti- 
mately along these lines, but we may 
have to wait quite a long time if people 
do not get bright ideas for developing 
the theoretical side.
