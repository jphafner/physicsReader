intro: Excerpt from <em>Quest</em>. 
---



The greatest theoretical physicist in Cambridge was P. A. M. Dirac, one of the outstanding scientists of our generation, then a young man about thirty. 
He still occupies the chair of mathematics, the genealogy of which can be traced directly to Newton. 


I knew nothing of Dirac, except that he was a great mathematical physicist. 
His papers, appearing chiefly in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>, were written with wonderful clarity and great imagination. 
His name is usually linked with those of Heisenberg and Schroedinger as the creators of quantum mechanics. 
Dirac&#39;s book <em>The Principles of Quantum Mechanics</em> is regarded as the bible of modem physics. 
It is deep, simple, lucid and original. 
It can only be compared in its importance and maturity to Newton&#39;s <em>Principia</em>. 
Admired by everyone as a genius, as a great star in the firmament of English physics, he created a legend around him. 
His thin figure with its long hands, walking in heat and cold without overcoat or hat, was a familiar one to Cambridge students. 
His loneliness and shyness were famous among physicists. 
Only a few men could penetrate his solitude. One of the fellows, a well-known physicist, told me: 


&ldquo;I still find it very difficult to talk with Dirac. 
If I need his advice I try to formulate my question as briefly as possible. 
He looks for five minutes at the ceiling, five minutes at the windows, and then says `Yes&#39; or `No.&#39; 
And he is always right.&rdquo; 


Once&emdash;according to a story which I heard&emdash;Dirac was lecturing in the United States and the chairman called for questions after the lecture. One of the audience said: 


&ldquo;I did not understand this and this in your arguments.&rdquo; 


Dirac sat quietly, as though the man had not spoken. 
A disagreeable silence ensued, and the chairman turned to Dirac uncertainly: 


&ldquo;Would you not be kind enough, Professor Dirac, to answer this question?&rdquo; 


To which Dirac replied: &ldquo;It was not a question; it was a statement.&rdquo; 


Another story also refers to his stay in the United States. 
He lived in an apartment with a famous French physicist and they invariably talked English to each other. 
Once the French physicist, finding it difficult to explain something in English, asked Dirac, who is half English and half French: 


&ldquo;Do you speak French?&rdquo; 


&ldquo;Yes. French is my mother&#39;s tongue,&rdquo; answered Dirac in an unusually long sentence. 
The French professor burst out: 


&ldquo;And you say this to me now, having allowed me to speak my bad, painful English for weeks! 
Why did you not tell me this before?&rdquo; 


&ldquo;You did not ask me before,&rdquo; was Dirac&#39;s answer. 


But a few scientists who knew Dirac better, who managed after years of acquaintance to talk to him, were full of praise of his gentle attitude toward everyone. 
They believed that his solitude was a result of shyness and could be broken in time by careful aggressiveness and persistence. 


These idiosyncrasies made it difficult to work with Dirac. 
The result has been that Dirac has not created a school by personal contact. 
He has created a school by his papers, by his book, but not by collaboration. 
He is one of the very few scientists who could work even on a lonely island if he had a library and could perhaps even do without books and journals. 


When I visited Dirac for the first time I did not know how difficult it was to talk to him as I did not then know anyone who could have warned me. 


I went along the narrow wooden stairs in St John&#39;s College and knocked at the door of Dirac&#39;s room. 
He opened it silently and with a friendly gesture indicated an armchair. 
I sat down and waited for Dirac to start the conversation. 
Complete silence.  
I began by warning my host that I spoke very little English. 
A friendly smile but again no answer. 
I had to go further: 


&ldquo;I talked with Professor Fowler. 
He told me that I am supposed to work with you. He suggested that I work on the internal conversion effect of positrons.&rdquo; 


No answer. I waited for some time and tried a direct question: 


&ldquo;Do you have any objection to my working on this subject?&rdquo; 


&ldquo;No.&rdquo; 


At least I had got a word out of Dirac. 


Then I spoke of the problem, took out my pen in order to write a formula. 
Without saying a word Dirac got up and brought paper. 
But my pen refused to write.
Silently Dirac took out his pencil and handed it to me. 
Again I asked him a direct question to which I received an answer in five words which took me two days to disrest. 
The conversation was finished. 
I made an attempt to prolong it. 


&ldquo;Do you mind if I bother you sometimes when I come across difficulties?&rdquo; 


&ldquo;No.&rdquo; 


I left Dirac&#39;s room, surprised and depressed. 
He was not forbidding, and I should have had no disagreeable feeling had I known what everyone in Cambridge knew. 
If he seemed peculiar to Englishmen, how much more so he seemed to a Pole who had polished his smooth tongue in Lwow caf&eacute;s! One of Dirac&#39;s principles is: 


&ldquo;One must not start a sentence before one knows how to finish it.&rdquo; 


Someone in Cambridge generalized this ironically: 


&ldquo;One must not start a life before one knows how to finish it.&rdquo; 


It is difficult to make friends in England. 
The process is slow and it takes time for one to graduate from pleasantries about the weather to personal themes. 
But for me it was exactly right. 
I was safe because nobody on the island would suddenly ask me: 
&ldquo;Have you been married?&rdquo; 
No conversation would even approach my personal problems. 
The gossipy atmosphere of Lwow&#39;s cafes belonged to the past. 
How we worked for hours, analyzing the actions and reactions of others, inventing talks and situations, imitating their voices, mocking their weaknesses, lifting gossip to an art and cultivating it for its own sake! 
I was glad of an end to these pleasures. 
The only remarks which one is likely to hear from an Englishman, on the subject of another&#39;s personality, are: 


&ldquo;He is very nice.&rdquo; 


&ldquo;He is quite nice.&rdquo; 


Or, in the worst case: 


&ldquo;I believe that he is all right.&rdquo; 


From these few variations, but much more from the subtle way in which they are spoken, one can gain a very fair picture after some practice. 
But the poverty of words kills the conversation after two minutes. 


The first month I met scarcely anyone. 
The problem on which I worked required tedious calculations rather than a search for new ideas.
I had never enjoyed this kind of work, but I determined to learn its technique. 
I worked hard. In the morning I went to a small dusty library in the Cavendish Laboratory. 
Every time I entered this building I became sentimental. 
If someone had asked me, &ldquo;What is the most important place in the world?&rdquo; 
I would have answered: &ldquo;The Cavendish Laboratory.&rdquo; Here Maxwell and J. J. Thomson worked. 
From here, in the last years under Rutherford&#39;s leadership, ideas and experiments emerged which changed our picture of the external world. 
Nearly all the great physicists of the world have lectured in this shabby old auditorium which is, by the way, the worst I have ever seen. 


I studied hard all day until late at night, interrupted only by a movie which took the place of the missing English conversation. 
I knew that I must bring results back to Poland. 
I knew what happened to anyone who returned empty-handed after a year on a fellowship. 
I had heard conversations on the subject and I needed only to change the names about to have a complete picture: 


A: I saw Infeld today; he is back already. 
What did he do in England? 


B: We have just searched carefully through the science abstracts. 
He didn&#39;t publish anything during the whole year. 


A: What? 
He couldn&#39;t squeeze out even one brief paper in twelve months, when he had nothing else to do and had the best help in the world? 


B: I&#39;m sure he didn&#39;t. 
He is finished now. 
I am really very sorry for him. 
Loria ought to have known better than to make a fool of himself by recommending Infeld for a Rockefeller fellowship. 


A: We can have fun when Loria comes here. 
We&#39;ll ask him what his protege did in England. 
Loria is very talkative. 
Let&#39;s give him a good opportunity. 


B: Yes. It will be quite amusing. 
What about innocently asking Infeld to give a lecture about Cambridge and his work there? 
It will be fun to see him dodging the subject of his own work. 


This is the way academic failure was discussed in Poland. 
I should have little right to object. 
Bitter competition and lack of opportunity create this atmosphere. 


When I came to Cambridge, before the academic year began, I learned that Professor Born would lecture there for a year. 
His name, too, is well known to every physicist. 
He was as famous for the distinguished work which he did in theoretical physics as for the school which he created. 
Born was a professor in Goettingen, the strongest mathematical center of the world before it was destroyed by Hitler. 
Many mathematicians and physicists from all over the world went to Goettingen to do research in the place associated with the shining names of Gauss in the past and Hilbert in the present. 
Dirac had had a fellowship in Goettingen and Heisenberg obtained his docentship there. 
Some of the most important papers in quantum mechanics were written in collaboration by Born and Heisenberg. 
Born was the first to present the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, introducing ideas which penetrated deeply into philosophy and are linked with the much-discussed problem of determinism and indeterminism. 


I also knew that Born had recently published an interesting note in Nature, concerning the generalization of Maxwell&#39;s theory of electricity, and had announced a paper, dealing at length with this problem which would appear shortly in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>. 


Being of Jewish blood. 
Professor Born had to leave Germany and immediately received five offers, from which he chose the invitation to Cambridge. 
For the first term he announced a course on the theory on which he was working. 


I attended his lectures. 
The audience consisted of graduate students and fellows from other colleges, chiefly research workers. 
Born spoke English with a heavy German accent. 
He was about fifty, with gray hair and a tense, intelligent face with eyes in which the suffering expression was intensified by fatigue. 
In the beginning I did not understand his lectures fully. 
The whole general theory seemed to be sketchy, a program rather than a finished piece of work. 


His lectures and papers revealed the difference between the German and English style in scientific work, as far as general comparisons of this kind make any sense at all. 
It was in the tradition of the German school to publish results quickly. 
Papers appeared in German journals six weeks after they were sent to the editor. 
Characteristic of this spirit of competition and priority quarrels was a story which Loria told me of a professor of his in Germany, a most distinguished man. 
This professor had attacked someone&#39;s work, and it turned out that he had read the paper too quickly; his attack was unjustified, and he simply had not taken the trouble to understand what the author said. 
When this was pointed out to him he was genuinely sorry that he had published a paper containing a severe and unjust criticism. 
But he consoled himself with the remark: &ldquo;Better a wrong paper than no paper at all.&rdquo; 


The English style of work is quieter and more dignified. 
No one is interested in quick publishing, and it matters much less to an Englishman when someone else achieves the same results and publishes them a few days earlier. 
It takes six months to print a paper in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>. 
Priority quarrels and stealing of ideas are practically unknown in England. 
The attitude is: &ldquo;Better no paper at all than a wrong paper.&rdquo; 


In the beginning, as I have said, I was not greatly impressed with Born&#39;s results. 
But later, when he came to the concrete problem of generalizing Maxwell&#39;s equations, I found the subject exciting, closely related to the problems on which I had worked before. 
In general terms the idea was: 


Maxwell&#39;s theory is the theory of the electromagnetic field, and it forms one of the most important chapters in theoretical physics. 
Its great achievement lies in the introduction of the concept of the <em>field</em>. 
It explains a wide region of experimental facts but, like every theory, it has its limitations. 
Maxwell&#39;s theory does not explain why elementary particles like electrons exist, and it does not bind the properties of the field to those of matter. 


After the discovery of elementary particles it was clear that Maxwell&#39;s theory, like all our theories, captures only part of the truth. And again, as always in physics, attempts were made to cover, through modifications and generalizations, a wider range of facts. 
Born succeeded in generalizing Maxwell&#39;s equations and replacing them by new ones. 
As their first approximation these new equations gave the old laws confirmed by experiments.
But in addition they gave a new solution representing an elementary particle, the electron. 
Its physical properties were determined to some extent by the new laws governing the field. 
The aim of this new theory was to form a bridge between two hitherto isolated and unreconciled concepts: field and matter. 
Born called it the Unitary Field Theory, the name indicating the union of these two fundamental concepts. 


After one of his lectures I asked Born whether he would lend me a copy of his manuscript. 
He gave it to me with the assurance that he would be very happy if I would help him. 
I wanted to understand a point which had not been clear to me during the lecture and which seemed to me to be an essential step. 
Born&#39;s new theory allowed the construction of an elementary particle, the electron, with a finite mass. 
Here lay the essential difference between Born&#39;s new and Maxwell&#39;s old theories. 
A whole chain of argument led to this theoretical determination of the mass of the electron. 
I suspected that something was wrong in this derivation. 
On the evening of the day I received the paper the point suddenly became clear to me. 
I knew that the mass of the electron was wrongly evaluated in Born&#39;s paper and I knew how to find the right value. 
My whole argument seemed simple and convincing to me. 
I could hardly wait to tell it to Born, sure that he would see my point immediately. 
The next day I went to him after his lecture and said: 


&ldquo;I read your paper; the mass of the electron is wrong.&rdquo; 


Born&#39;s face looked even more tense than usual. He said: 


&ldquo;This is very interesting. Show me why.&rdquo; 


Two of his audience were still present in the lecture room. 
I took a piece of chalk and wrote a relativistic formula for the mass density. 
Born interrupted me angrily: 


&ldquo;This problem has nothing to do with relativity theory. 
I don&#39;t like such a formal approach. I find nothing wrong with the way I introduced the mass.&rdquo; 
Then he turned toward the two students who were listening to our stormy discussion. 


&ldquo;What do you think of my derivation?&rdquo; 


They nodded their heads in full approval. 
I put down the piece of chalk and did not even try to defend my point. 


Born felt a little uneasy. 
Leaving the lecture room, he said: 


&ldquo;I shall think it over.&rdquo; 


I was annoyed at Born&#39;s behavior as well as at my own and was, for one afternoon, disgusted with Cambridge. 
I thought: &ldquo;Here I met two great physicists. One of them does not talk. 
I could as easily read his papers in Poland as here. 
The other talks, but he is rude.&rdquo; 
I scrutinized my argument carefully but could find nothing wrong with it. 
I made some further progress and found that new and interesting consequences could be drawn if the &ldquo;free densities&rdquo; were introduced relativistically. 
A different interpretation of the unitary theory could be achieved which would deepen its physical meaning. 


The next day I went again to Born&#39;s lecture. 
He stood at the door before the lecture room. 
When I passed him he said to me: 


&ldquo;I am waiting for you. You were quite right. 
We will talk it over after the lecture. 
You must not mind my being rude. 
Everyone who has worked with me knows it.
I have a resistance against accepting something from outside. 
I get angry and swear but always accept after a time if it is right.&rdquo; 


Our collaboration had begun with a quarrel, but a day later complete peace and understanding had been restored. 
I told Born about my new interpretation connecting more closely and clearly, through the &ldquo;free densities,&rdquo; the field and particle aspects. 
He immediately accepted these ideas with enthusiasm. 
Our collaboration grew closer. We discussed, worked together after lectures, in Born&#39;s home or mine. 
Soon our relationship became informal and friendly. 


I ceased to work on my old problem. 
After three months of my stay in Cambridge we published together two notes in <em>Nature</em>, and a long paper, in which the foundations of the New Unitary Field Theory were laid down more deeply and carefully than before, was ready for publication in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society</em>. 


For the first time in my life I had close contact with a famous, distinguished physicist, and I learned much through our relationship. 
Born came to my home on his bicycle whenever he wished to communicate with me, and I visited him, unannounced, whenever I felt like it. 
The atmosphere of his home was a combination of high intellectual level with heavy Germany pedantry. 
In the hall there was a wooden gadget announcing which of the members of the family were out and which were in. 


I marveled at the way in which he managed his heavy correspondence, answering letters with incredible dispatch, at the same time looking through scientific papers. 
His tremendous collection of reprints was well ordered; even the reprints from cranks and lunatics were kept, under the heading &ldquo;Idiots.&rdquo; 
Born functioned like an entire institution, combining vivid imagination with splendid organization. He worked quickly and in a restless mood. 
As in the case of nearly all scientists, not only the result was important but the fact that he had achieved it. 
This is human, and scientists are human. 
The only scientist I have ever met for whom this personal aspect of work is of no concern at all is Einstein. 
Perhaps to find complete freedom from human weakness we must look up to the highest level achieved by the human race. 
There was something childish and attractive in Born&#39;s eagerness to go ahead quickly, in his restlessness and his moods, which changed suddenly from high enthusiasm to deep depression. 
Sometimes when I would come with a new idea he would say rudely, &ldquo;I think it is rubbish,&rdquo; but he never minded if I applied the same phrase to some of his ideas. 
But the great, the celebrated Born was as happy and as pleased as a young student at words of praise and encouragement. 
In his enthusiastic attitude, in the vividness of his mind, the impulsiveness with which he grasped and rejected ideas, lay his great charm. 
Near his bed he had always a pencil and a piece of paper on which to scribble his inspirations, to avoid turning them over and over in his mind during sleepless nights. 


Once I asked Born how he came to study theoretical physics. 
I was interested to know at what age the first impulse to choose a definite path in life crystalizes. 
Born told me his story. 
His father was a medical man, a university professor, famous and rich. 
When he died he left his son plenty of money and good advice. 
The money was sufficient, in normal times, to assure his son&#39;s independence. 
The advice was simply to listen during his first student year to many lectures on many subjects and to make a choice only at the end of the first year. 
So young Born went to the university at Breslau, listened to lectures on law, literature, biology, music, economics, astronomy. 
He liked the astronomy lectures the most. 
Perhaps not so much for the lectures themselves as for the old Gothic building in which they were held. 
But he soon discovered that to understand astronomy one must know mathematics. 
He asked where the best mathematicians in the world were to be found and was told &ldquo;Goettingen.&rdquo; 
So he went to Goettingen, where he finished his studies as a theoretical physicist, habilitated and finally became a professor. 


&ldquo;At that time, before the war,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I could have done whatever I wanted with my life since I did not even know what the struggle for existence meant. 
I believe I could have become a successful writer or a pianist. 
But I found the work in theoretical physics more pleasant and more exciting than anything else.&rdquo; 


Through our work I gained confidence in myself, a confidence that was strengthened by Born&#39;s assurance that ours was one of the pleasantest collaborations he had ever known. 
Loyally he stressed my contributions in his lectures and pointed out my share in our collaboration. 
I was happy in the excitement of obtaining new results and in the conviction that I was working on essential problems, the importance of which I certainly exaggerated. 
Having new ideas, turning blankness into understanding, suddenly finding the right solution after weeks or months of painful doubt, creates perhaps the highest emotion man can experience. 
Every scientist knows this feeling of ecstasy even if his achievements are small. 
But this pure feeling of <em>Eureka</em> Is mixed with overtones of very human, selfish emotions: &ldquo;I found it; I will have an important paper; it will help me in my career.&rdquo; 
I was fully aware of the presence of these overtones in my own consciousness.
