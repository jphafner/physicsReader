Once upon a time there was a Daytime surveyor who measured off the king&#39;s lands. 
\marginpar{Daytime surveyor uses magnetic north}
He took his directions of north and east from a magnetic compass needle. 
Eastward directions from the center of the town square he measured in meters (<span class="math">x</span> in meters). 
Northward directions were sacred and were measured in a different unit, in miles (<span class="math">y</span> in miles). 
His records were complete and accurate and were often consulted by the Daytimers. 

Nighttimers used the services of another surveyor. 
\marginpar{Nightime surveyor uses North Star north}
His north and east directions were based on the North Star. 
He too measured distances eastward from the center of the town square in meters ($x&#39;$ in meters) and sacred distances north in miles ($y&#39;$ in miles). 
His records were complete and accurate. 
Every corner of a plot appeared in his book with its two coordinates, $x&#39;$ and $y&#39;$. 

One fall a student of surveying turned up with novel openmindedness. 
Contrary to all previous tradition he attended both of the rival schools operated by the two leaders of surveying. 
At the day school he learned from one expert his method of recording the location of the gates of the town and the corners of plots of land. 
At night school he learned the other method. 
As the days and nights passed the student puzzled more and more in an attempt to find some harmonious relationship between the rival ways of recording location. 
He carefully compared the records of the two surveyors on the locations of the town gates relative to the center of the town square: 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:1}
\caption{Two different sets of records for the same points.}
\end{table}

In defiance of tradition, the student took the daring and heretical step to convert northward measurements, previously expressed always in miles, into meters by multiplication with a constant conversion factor, <span class="math">k</span>. 
He then discovered that the quantity $[(x_A)^2 + (ky_A)^2]^{1/2}$ based on Daytime measurements of the position of gate A had exactly the same numerical value as the quantity

\label{fig:1}
\caption{The town and its gates, showing coordinate axes used by two different surveyors.}
</figure>

$[(x_A&#39;)^2 +(ky_A)^2]^{1/2}$ computed from the readings of the Nighttime surveyor for gate <span class="math">A</span>. 
He tried the same comparison on the readings computed from the recorded positions of gate <span class="math">B</span>, and found agreement here too.
The student&#39;s excitement grew as he checked his scheme of comparison for all the other town gates and found everywhere agreement. 
He decided to give his discovery a name. 
He called the quantity 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:1}
    \marginpar{Discovery: invariance of distance}
    [(x_A&#39;)^2 +(ky_A)^2]^{1/2}
\end{equation}


the <em>distance</em> of the point $(x, y)$ from the center of town. 
He said that he had discovered the principle of the invariance of distance; that one gets exactly the same distances from the Daytime coordinates as from the Nighttime coordinates, despite the fact that the two sets of surveyors&#39; numbers are quite different. 

This story illustrates the naive state of physics before the discovery of special relativity by Einstein of Bern, Lorentz of Leiden, and Poincare of Paris. 
How naive? 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Surveyors in this mythical kingdom measured northward distances in a sacred unit, the mile, different from the unit used in measuring eastward distances. 
        Similarly, people studying physics measured time in a sacred unit, the second, different from the unit used in measuring space. 
        No one thought of using the same unit for both, or of what one could learn by squaring and combining space and time coordinates when both were measured in meters. 
        The conversion factor between seconds and meters, namely the speed of light, $c=2.997925\times 10^8$ m/s, was regarded as a sacred number. 
        It was not recognized as a mere conversion factor like the factor of conversion between miles and meters&emdash;a factor that arose out of historical accidents alone, with no deeper physical significance. 

    \item In the parable the northbound coordinates, <span class="math">y</span> and $y&#39;$, as recorded by the two surveyors did not differ very much because the two directions of north were separated only by the small angle of 10 degrees. 
        At first our mythical student thought the small differences between <span class="math">y</span> and $y&#39;$ were due to surveying error alone. Analogously, people have thought of the time between the explosion of two firecrackers as the same, by whomever observed. 
        Only in 1905 did we learn that the time difference between the second event and the first, or &ldquo;reference event,&rdquo; really has different values, <span class="math">t</span> and $t&#39;$, for observers in different states of motion. 
        Think of one observer standing quietly in the laboratory. 
        The other observer zooms by in a high-speed rocket. 
        The rocket comes in through the front entry, goes down the middle of the long corridor and out the back door. 
        The first firecracker goes off in the corridor (&ldquo;reference event&rdquo;) then the other (&ldquo;event A&rdquo;).
        Both observers agree that the reference event establishes the zero of time and the origin for distance measurements. 
        The second explosion occurs, for example, 5 seconds later than the first, as measured by laboratory clocks, and 12 meters further down the corridor. 
        Then its time coordinate is $t_A=5$ seconds and its position coordinate is $x_A=12$ meters. 
        Other explosions and events also take place down the length of the corridor. 
        The readings of the two observers can be arranged as in Table 2. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}
\label{tab:2}
\caption{ 
    Space and time coordinates of the same events as seen by two observers in relative motion. 
    For simplicity the <span class="math">y</span> and <span class="math">z</span> coordinates are zero, and the rocket is moving in the <span class="math">x</span> direction.

The mythical student&#39;s discovery of the concept of distance is matched by the Einstein-Poincare discovery in 1905 of the idea of interval. 
The interval as calculated from the one observer&#39;s measurements

interval = [(c/a)&#39; - (xa)&#39;]

agrees with the interval as calculated from the other observer&#39;s measure- 
ments 



(3) 



interval = [{cuj - {x^&#39;n&rdquo;&#39; 



even though the separate coordinates employed in the two calculations 
do not agree. The two observers will find different space and time coordi- 
nates for events A, B, C, . . . relative to the same reference event, but 
when they calculate the Einstein intervals between these events, their 
results will agree. The invariance of the interval— its independence from 
the choice of the reference frame— forces one to recognize that time can- 
not be separated from space. Space and time are part of the single 
entity, spacetime. The geometry of spacetime is truly four-dimensional. 
In one way of speaking, the "direction of the time axis" depends upon the 
state of motion of the observer, just as the directions of the y axes 
employed by the surveyors depend upon their different standards of 
"north."

The rest of this chapter is an elaboration of the analogy between surveying 
in space and relating events to one another in spacetime. Table 3 is a preview 
of this elaboration. To recognize the unity of space and time one follows the 
procedure that makes a landscape take on meaning— he looks at it from several 
angles. This is the reason for comparing space and time coordinates of an 
event in two different reference frames in relative motion.

The task of the surveyor is to locate the posi- 
tion of a point (gate A) using one of two co- 
ordinate systems that are rotated relative to 
one another. 



The task of the physicist is to locate the posi- 
tion and time of an event (firecracker explo- 
sion A) using one of two reference frames 
which are in motion relative to one another. 



The two coordinate systems: oriented to 
magnetic north and to North-Star north. 



The two reference frames: the laboratory 
frame and the rocket frame. 



For convenience all surveyors agree to make 
position measurements with respect to a 
common origin (the center of the town 
square). 



For convenience all physicists agree to make 
position and time measurements with re- 
spect to a common reference event (explo- 
sion of the reference firecracker). 



The analysis of the surveyors&#39; results is sim- 
plified if X and v coordinates of a point are 
both measured in the same units, in meters. 



The separate coordinates x\ and y^ of gate 
A do not have the same values respectively in 
two coordinate systems that are rotated 
relative to one another. 



The analysis of the physicists&#39; results is sim- 
plified if the X and t coordinates of an event 
are both measured in the same units, in 
meters. 

The separate coordinates x?, and fx of event 
A do not have the same values respectively in 
two reference frames that are in uniform 
motion relative to one another. 



Invariance of distance. The distance (.va^ + 
&gt;&#39;A^)"&#39; between gate A and the town square 
has the same value when calculated using 
measurements made with respect to either of 
two rotated coordinate systems (x\ and va 
both measured in meters). 



Invariance of the interval. The interval (t\^ — 
ata^)"^ between event A and the reference 
event has the same value when calculated 
using measurements made with respect to 
either of two reference frames in relative 
motion (x\ and t\ both measured in meters). 



Euclidean transformation. Using Euclidean 
geometry, the surveyor can solve the follow- 
ing problem: Given the Nighttime coordin- 
ates xa.&#39; and y\&#39; of gate A and the relative 
inclination of respective coordinate axes, 
find the Daytime coordinates .va and va of 
the same gate. 



Lorentz transformation. Using Lorentz 
geometry, the physicist can solve the follow- 
ing problem: Given the rocket coordinates 
.ya&#39; and t\&#39; of event A and the relative 
velocity between rocket and laboratory 
frames, find the laboratory coordinates xk 
and /a of the same event. 



Measure time in meters 



The parable of the surveyors cautions us to use the same unit to measure 
both distance and time. So use meters for both. Time can be measured in 
meters. When a mirror is mounted at each end of a stick one-half meter 
long, a flash of light may be bounced back and forth between these two mir-

rors. Such a device is a clock. This clock may be said to "tick" each time the 
light flash arrives back at the first mirror. Between ticks the light flash has 
traveled a round-trip distance of 1 meter. Therefore the unit of time between 
ticks of this clock is called 1 meter of light-travel time or more simply / meter 
of time. (Show that 1 second is approximately equal to 3 X ICH meters of 
light-travel time.) 

One purpose of the physicist is to sort out simple relations between events. 
To do this here he might as well choose a particular reference frame with 
respect to which the laws of physics have a simple form. Now, the force of Simplify: Pick freely 
gravity acts on everything near the earth. Its presence complicates the laws of falling laboratory 
motion as we know them from common experience. In order to eliminate this 
and other complications, we will, in the next section, focus attention on a 
freely falling reference frame near the earth. In this reference frame no gravi- 
tational forces will be felt. Such a gravitation-free reference frame will be 
called an inertial reference frame. Special relativity deals with the classical 
laws of physics expressed with respect to an inertial reference frame. 

The principles of special relativity are remarkably simple. They are very 
much simpler than the axioms of Euclid or the principles of operating an auto- 
mobile. Yet both Euclid and the automobile have been mastered— perhaps 
with insufficient surprise— by generations of ordinary people. Some of the 
best minds of the twentieth century struggled with the concepts of relativity, 
not because nature is obscure, but simply because man finds it difficult to out- 
grow established ways of looking at nature. For us the battle has already been 
won. The concepts of relativity can now be expressed simply enough to make 
it easy to think correctly— thus "making the bad difficult and the good easy."t 
The problem of understanding relativity is no longer one of learning but one of 
intuition— a. practiced way of seeing. With this way of seeing, a remarkable 
number of otherwise incomprehensible experimental results are seen to be 
perfectly natural, t
