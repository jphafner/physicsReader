Mr Tompkins was very amused about his adventures in the relativistic city, but was sorry that the professor had not been with him to give any explanation of the strange things he had observed: the mystery of how the railway brakeman had been able to prevent the passengers from getting old worried him especially.
Many a night he went to bed with the hope that he would see this interesting city again, but the dreams were rare and mostly unpleasant; last time it was the manager of the bank who was firing him for the uncertainty he introduced into the bank accounts &hellip; so now he decided that he had better take a holiday, and go for a week somewhere to the sea.
Thus he found himself sitting in a compartment of a train and watching through the window the grey roofs of the city suburb gradually giving place to the green meadows of the countryside.
He picked up a newspaper and tried to interest himself in the Vietnam conflict.
But it all seemed to be so dull, and the railway carriage rocked him pleasantly &hellip;

When he lowered the paper and looked out of the window again the landscape had changed considerably.
The telegraph poles were so close to each other that they looked like a hedge, and the trees had extremely narrow crowns and were like Italian cypresses.
Opposite to him sat his old friend the professor, looking through the window with great interest.
He had probably got in while Mr Tompkins was busy with his newspaper.

&lsquo;We are in the land of relativity,&rsquo; said Mr Tompkins, &lsquo;aren&#39;t we?&rsquo;

&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; exclaimed the professor, &lsquo;you know so much already!
Where did you learn it from?&rsquo;

&lsquo;I have already been here once, but did not have the pleasure of your company then.&rsquo;

&lsquo;So you are probably going to be my guide this time,&rsquo; the old man said.

&lsquo;I should say not,&rsquo; retorted Mr Tompkins.
&lsquo;I saw a lot of unusual things, but the local people to whom I spoke could not understand what my trouble was at all.&rsquo;

&lsquo;Naturally enough,&rsquo; said the professor.
&lsquo;They are bom in this world and consider all the phenomena happening around them as self-evident.
But I imagine they would be quite surprised if they happened to get into the world in which you used to live.
It would look so remarkable to them.&rsquo;

&lsquo;May I ask you a question?&rsquo; said Mr Tompkins.
&lsquo;Last time I was here, I met a brakeman from the railway who insisted that owing to the fact that the train stops and starts again the passengers grow old less quickly than the people in the city.
Is this magic, or is it also consistent with modern science?&rsquo;

&lsquo;There is never any excuse for putting forward magic as an explanation,&rsquo; said the professor.
&lsquo;This follows directly from the laws of physics.
It was shown by Einstein, on the basis of his analysis of new (or should I say as-old-as-the-world but newly discovered) notions of space and time, that all physical processes slow down when the system in which they are taking place is changing its velocity.
In our world the effects are almost unobservably small, but here, owing to the small velocity of light, they are usually very obvious.
If, for example, you tried to boil an egg here, and instead of letting the saucepan stand quietly on the stove moved it to and fro, constantly changing its velocity, it would take you not five but perhaps six minutes to boil it properly.
Also in the human body all processes slow down, if the person is sitting (for example) in a rocking chair or in a train which changes its speed; we live more slowly under such conditions.
As, however, all processes slow down to the same extent, physicists prefer to say that <em>in a non-uniformly moving system time flows more slowly</em>.&rsquo;

&lsquo;But do scientists actually observe such phenomena in our world at home?&rsquo;

&lsquo;They do, but it requires considerable skill.
It is technically very difficult to get the necessary accelerations, but the conditions existing in a non-uniformly moving system are analogous, or should I say identical, to the result of the action of a very large force of gravity.
You may have noticed that when you are in an elevator which is rapidly accelerated upwards it seems to you that you have grown heavier; on the contrary, if the elevator starts downward (you realize it best when the rope breaks) you feel as though you were losing weight.
The explanation is that the gravitational field created by acceleration is added to or subtracted from the gravity of the earth.
Well, the potential of gravity on the sun is much larger than on the surface of the earth and all processes there should be therefore slightly slowed down.
Astronomers do observe this.&rsquo;

&lsquo;But they cannot go to the sun to observe it?&rsquo;

&lsquo;They do not need to go there.
They observe the light coming to us from the sun.
This light is emitted by the vibration of different atoms in the solar atmosphere.
If all processes go slower there, the speed of atomic vibrations also decreases, and by comparing the light emitted by solar and terrestrial sources one can see the difference.
Do you know, by the way&rsquo;&mdash;the professor interrupted himself&mdash;&lsquo;what the name of this little station is that we are now passing?&rsquo;

The train was rolling along the platform of a little countryside station which was quite empty except for the station master and a young porter sitting on a luggage trolley and reading a newspaper.
Suddenly the station master threw his hands into the air and fell down on his face.
Mr Tompkins did not hear the sound of shooting, which was probably lost in the noise of the train, but the pool of blood forming round the body of the station master left no doubt.
The professor immediately pulled the emergency cord and the train stopped with a jerk.
When they got out of the carriage the young porter was running towards the body, and a country policeman was approaching.

&lsquo;Shot through the heart,&rsquo; said the policeman after inspecting the body, and, putting a heavy hand on the porter&rsquo;s shoulder, he went on: &lsquo;I am arresting you for the murder of the station master.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I didn&#39;t kill him,&rsquo; exclaimed the unfortunate porter.
&lsquo;I was reading a newspaper when I heard the shot.
These gentlemen from the train have probably seen all and can testify that I am innocent.&rsquo;


&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr Tompkins, &lsquo;I saw with my own eyes that this man was reading his paper when the station master was shot.
I can swear it on the Bible.&rsquo;

&lsquo;But you were in the moving train,&rsquo; said the policeman, taking an authoritative tone, &lsquo;and what you saw is therefore no evidence at all.
As seen from the platform the man could have been shooting at the very same moment.
Don&#39;t you know that simultaneousness depends on the system from which you observe it?
Come along quietly,&rsquo; he said, turning to the porter.

&lsquo;Excuse me, constable,&rsquo; interrupted the professor, &lsquo;but you are absolutely wrong, and I do not think that at headquarters they will like your ignorance.
It is true, of course, that the notion of simultaneousness is highly relative in your country.
It is also true that two events in different places could be simultaneous or not, depending on the motion of the observer.
But, even in your country, no observer could see the consequence before the cause.
You have never received a telegram before it was sent, have you?
or got drunk before opening the bottle?
As I understand you, you suppose that owing to the motion of the train the shooting would have been seen by us much <em>later</em> than its effect and, as we got out of the train immediately we saw the station master fall, we still had not seen the shooting itself.
I know that in the police force you are taught to believe only what is written in your instructions, but look into them and probably you will find something about it.&rsquo;

The professor&#39;s tone made quite an impression on the policeman and, pulling out his pocket book of instructions, he started to read it slowly through.
Soon a smile of embarrassment spread out across his big, red face.

&lsquo;Here it is,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;section 37, subsection 12, paragraph e: &ldquo;As a perfect alibi should be recognized any authoritative proof, from any moving system whatsoever, that at the moment of the crime or within a time interval <span class="math">&plusmn; cd</span> (<span class="math">c</span> being natural speed limit and <span class="math">d</span> the distance from the place of the crime) the suspect was seen in another place.&rdquo;&rsquo;

&lsquo;You are free, my good man,&rsquo; he said to the porter, and then, turning to the professor: &lsquo;Thank you very much.
Sir, for saving me from trouble with headquarters, I am new to the force and not yet accustomed to all these rules.
But I must report the murder anyway,&rsquo; and he went to the telephone box.
A minute later he was shouting across the platform.
&lsquo;All is in order now!
They caught the real murderer when he was running away from the station.
Thank you once more!&rsquo;

&lsquo;I may be very stupid,&rsquo; said Mr Tompkins, when the train started again, &lsquo;but what is all this business about simultaneousness?
Has it really no meaning in this country?&rsquo;

&lsquo;It has,&rsquo; was the answer, &lsquo;but only to a certain extent; otherwise I should not have been able to help the porter at all.
You see, the existence of a natural speed limit for the motion of any body or the propagation of any signal, makes simultaneousness in our ordinary sense of the word lose its meaning.
You probably will see it more easily this way.
Suppose you have a friend living in a far-away town, with whom you correspond by letter, mail train being the fastest means of communication.
Suppose now that something happens to you on Sunday and you learn that the same thing is going to happen to your friend.
It is clear that you cannot let him know about it before Wednesday.
On the other hand, if he knew in advance about the thing that was going to happen to you, the last date to let you know about it would have been the previous Thursday.
Thus for six days, from Thursday to next Wednesday, your friend was not able either to influence your fate on Sunday or to learn about it.
From the point of view of causality he was, so to speak, excommunicated from you for six days.&rsquo;


&lsquo;what about a telegram?&rsquo; suggested Mr Tompkins.

&lsquo;Well, I accepted that the velocity of the mail train was the maximum possible velocity, which is about correct in this country.
At home the velocity of light is the maximum velocity and you cannot send a signal faster than by radio.&rsquo;


&lsquo;But still,&rsquo; said Mr Tompkins, &lsquo;even if the velocity of the mail train could not be surpassed, what has it to do with simultaneousness?
My friend and myself would still have our Sunday dinners simultaneously, wouldn&#39;t we?&rsquo;

&lsquo;No, that statement would not have any sense then; one observer would agree to it, but there would be others, making their observations from different trains, who would insist that you eat your Sunday dinner at the same time as your friend has his Friday breakfast or Tuesday lunch.
But in no way could anybody observe you and your friend simultaneously having meals more than three days apart.&rsquo;

&lsquo;But how can all this happen?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr Tompkins unbelievingly.

&lsquo;In a very simple way, as you might have noticed from my lectures.
The upper limit of velocity must remain the same as observed from different moving systems.
If we accept this we should conclude that &hellip;&rsquo;

But their conversation was interrupted by the train arriving at the station at which Mr Tompkins had to get out.
