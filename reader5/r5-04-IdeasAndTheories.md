## Quantum Field Theory

The size of particles compares to that of atoms as atoms compare to the scale of things in the world of familiar objects; both involve roughly a hundred-thousand-fold ratio in magnitude.
A tiny grain of sand, perhaps a thousandth (10<sup>&minus;3</sup>) centimeter across, behaves in every way like an object of the largescale world.
But a downward plunge to a hundred millionth (10<sup>&minus;</sup>) centimeter leads to a realm in which everything existing in space and happening in time is a manifestation of changing patterns of matter waves.
Things arrange themselves in sequences of discrete configurations, changes occur in abrupt quantum jumps and the pertinent laws of motion determine only the probabilities of events, not the individual events themselves.
These profound changes in behavior are due primarily to differences in the relative size of objects and their de Broglie waves.
Large objects are enormous compared to their associated waves; atoms and their waves are similar in size.


In the second downward plunge of minuteness, from a scale of 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> to one of 10<sup>&minus;13</sup> centimeter, a contrast of this sort does not exist.
Here the matter waves are again comparable in size to the tiny regions in which particle events occur.
Their radically new characteristics must be laid to other causes, in part to the change of scale itself.
By quantum-mechanical principles the wave packets associated with events restricted to tiny regions of space must be constituted of very short matter waves; and because of the de Broghe relation between wavelength and momentum, this implies large values of velocity and energy and brief interaction times.
Therefore, particle phenomena are necessarily rapid and violent, so violent that mass and energy interchange freely, and matter loses the stability it displays under less drastic conditions.


Atoms are a &ldquo;half-way stopover&rdquo; between the things of everyday experience and the weird realm of particles.
They could still be treated to some extent in terms of familiar concepts.
Thus, the Bohr atom model is frankly a mechanism operating in a familiar, albeit altered, manner.
Particles are, however, conceptually more remote from atoms than are atoms from sticks and stones.


It is hardly surprising that attempts to extend the methods of quantum mechanics, so sucessful in dealing with atomic phenomena, to the realm of particles have met with difficulties.
To make progress, it has been necessary to devise different methods of attack for various kinds of problems, for the properties of particles, for their groupings, their interactions, and so forth.
There exists, however, one generally recognized theoretical method of dealing with particle phenomena, the quantum field theory, which is adequate, in principle, to cope with all aspects of particle physics.
As the name implies, it is concerned with the relations of quanta and fields.


Electric and magnetic fields have already been discussed briefly as regions in which charges experience electric and magnetic forces.
To physicists in the mid-nineteenth century, fields had a more tangible meaning.
They were assumed to be conditions of strain in an ether, a tenuous elastic &ldquo;jelly&rdquo; filling all space.
Where there is a field, the ether jelly is under a strain of tension or compression, different from its normal relaxed state; and these strains were thought to produce the forces acting upon electric charges.
There was also the luminiferous ether, possibly different from the electric and magnetic ethers which, when set into oscillation at one point, could transmit the oscillatory strains as a light wave.


Maxwell began the development of his monumental synthesis of electromagnetism and optics (page 48) by constmcting an elaborate model of a mechanical ether, presumably capable of transmitting the various field effects.
But after having built the electromagnetic theory of light, in which light appears as a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields propagated together through space, he saw that his mathematical equations contained everything of importance.
In the publication of his studies <em>On a Dynamical Theory of the Electro-magnetic Field</em> (1864), he presented only the mathematical theory with no mention of the ether model.
Although he had thus made the ether unnecessary, neither he nor his contemporaries thought of casting it aside. Even up to the beginning of the twentieth century almost all physicists continued to believe in the reality of the ether or at least in the need of retaining it as an intuitive conception.
But in 1905, in his famous publication on the theory of relativity, Einstein showed that the idea of an entity filling all space and acting as a stationary reference, relative to which all motions could be described in an absolute manner, is untenable, that only the relative motions of objects have meaning.
After the ether had thus been abolished, the fields remained, like the grin of the vanished Cheshire cat.


Yet fields, in particular the traveling electromagnetic fields of the light waves, still retained a measure of reality.
These carried energy and momentum and could cause electric charges to oscillate.
Again, it was Einstein who robbed them of these trappings of reality when, by postulating the photons, he relegated the light waves to a mere ghostly existence as nothing more than mathe- matical abstractions determining the gross average propagation of flocks of photons.


Quantum field theory has wrought a curious revival in the status of fields.
Although they are still largely mathematical conceptions, they have acquired strong overtones of reality.
In fact, this theory asserts that fields alone are real, that they are the substance of the universe, and that particles are merely the momentary manifestations of interacting fields.


The way in which particles are derived from fields is analogous to the construction of atoms out of patterns of matter waves in Schrodinger&#39;s original conception of wave mechanics.
Here the properties of atoms, and their interactions with each other and with photons, are described in terms of the configurations and changes of these wave patterns.
Similarly, the solution of the quantum field equations leads to quantized energy values which manifest themselves with all the properties of particles.
The activities of the fields seem particlelike because fields interact very abruptly and in very minute regions of space. Nevertheless, even avowed quantum field theorists are not above talking about &ldquo;particles&rdquo; as if there really were such things, a practice which will be adopted in continuing this discussion.


The ambitious program of explaining all properties of particles and all of their interactions in terms of fields has actually been successful only for three of them: the photons, electrons and positrons.
This limited quantum field theory has the special name of <em>quantum electrodynamics</em>.
It results from a union of classical electrodynamics and quantum theory, modified to be compatible with the principles of relativity.
The three particles with which it deals are well suited to theoretical treatment because they are stable, their properties are well understood arid they interact through the familiar electromagnetic force.


Quantum electrodynamics was developed around 1930, largely through the work of Paul Dirac.
It yielded two important results: it showed that the electron has an <em>alter ego</em>, the positron, and it gave the electron its spin, a property which previously had to be added arbitrarily.
When it was applied to the old problem of the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum (the small differences between the observed wavelengths and those given by the Bohr theory), it produced improved values in good agreement with existing measures.
However, in 1947 two experimenters, Willis Lamb and Robert Retherford, made highly precise measurements of the small differences in energy levels, using instead of photons the quanta of radio waves, which are more delicate probes of far lower energy.
Their results, which showed distinct discrepancies from Dirac&#39;s theory, stimulated renewed theoretical efforts.
Three men, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga of Tokyo University, Richard Feynman of the University of California and Julian Schwinger of Harvard, working independently, produced an improved theory which at long last gave precise agreement with experiment.
For this work the three shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics.


The study of particles by the methods of quantum field theory was begun at a time when only a few were known.
Since the field associated with a particle represents all of its properties, there had to be a distinct kind of field for each kind of particle; and as their number increased, so did the number of different fields, a complication which pleased no one.
Actually, little further progress was made in the two decades following the success of quantum electrodynamics. Attempts to deal with the strongly interacting particles, the mesons and baryons, were frustrated by seemingly insurmountable mathematical difficulties.
Still, the idea of developing a basic and comprehensive theory of particles continued to have strong appeal.
In the mid-1960&#39;s the introduction of powerful new mathematical techniques has yielded results which indicate that this may yet be accomplished.

## The Electrostatic Field

The interaction of the electromagnetic fields, whose energy is carried by photons, and the electron fields, which manifest themselves as electrons, is already familiar in the production of photons by the activity of atomic electrons.
It is, however, not apparent how photons, which travel through space with the highest possible velocity, might be involved in static electric fields such as those which hold electrons close to the atomic nucleus.
Here a new concept is needed, that of virtual photons.
Their existence is due in a remarkable, yet logical manner to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
One form of this principle (page 99) asserts that the uncertainty <span class="math">&Delta;E</span> in the energy possessed by a sys- tem and the uncertainty <span class="math">&Delta;t</span> in the time at which it has this energy are related by the formula:

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="\Delta E\,\Delta t \geq \frac{h}{2\pi}" display="block">
  <mrow>
    <mrow>
      <mo>&Delta;</mo>
      <mi>E</mi>
      <mo>&times;</mo>
      <mo>&Delta;</mo>
      <mi>t</mi>
    </mrow>
    <mo>&ge;</mo>
    <mrow>
      <mfrac>
        <mi>h</mi>
        <mrow>

          <mi>&pi;</mi>
        </mrow>
      </mfrac>
    </mrow>
  </mrow>
</math>

Because of the relativistic correspondence between energy and mass, this relation applies as well to the uncertainty <span class="math">&Delta;m</span> in mass, which is <span class="math">&Delta;E/c<sup>2</sup></span>.
Applied to an electron, this means physically that its mass does not maintain one precise value; rather, it <em>fluctuates</em>, the magnitude of the fluctuations being in inverse proportion to the time interval during which they persist.
Electrons effect their mass or equivalent energy fluctuations by emitting photons, but these exist only on the sufferance of the uncertainty principle.
When their time <span class="math">&Delta;t</span> is up, they must vanish.
They cannot leave the electron permanently, carrying off energy, nor can they deliver energy to any detection device, including the human eye.
It is impossible for them to be seen or detected; therefore they are called virtual, not real.
Yet there is a warrant for their existence; theories in which they are postulated yield results in agreement with experimental observation.
In the language of quantum field theory the interaction of electron and photon fields brings about a condition in which by permission of the uncertainty principle virtual photons are continually created and destroyed.


Virtual photons of greater energy exist for shorter times and travel shorter distances away from the electron before they are annihilated; those of lesser energy reach out farther.
In fact, they travel a distance equal to the length of their associated waves (radio waves, light waves and others), which may vary over the whole range of values from zero to infinity.
This swarm of virtual photons darting outward from the central electron in all directions constitutes the electric field surrounding the electron.
Calculations based on this concept show that the field is strongest close by and drops off in inverse proportion to the square of the distance, in agreement with Coulomb&#39;s law of electric force (page 27).
Virtual photons are the quanta of all electrostatic fields.
For large charged objects they are so numerous that they produce a sensibly smooth and continuous effect, identical with the classical field.


Two electrically charged objects exchange virtual photons.
This produes an <em>exchange force</em> between them, a result which follows directly from the principles of quantum electrodynamics, but which has unfortunately no analogy in classical physics and cannot be visualized in terms of familiar experience.
The theory shows that the force between charges of like sign is one of repulsion, that for opposite signs it is an attraction, again in agreement with experiment.


There are, however, further complications. The virtual photons, produced by the electron, interact with the electron field to produce additional virtual electrons, which in turn yield virtual photons, and so on.
Thus the theory, starting with one electron, ends up with an infinite number of them.
Fortunately, the magnitudes of the successive steps in this sequence drop off rapidly so that after much effort the results of all this complex activity could be calculated very precisely.


This production of secondary virtual electrons manifests itself in the hydrogen atom as a slight alteration of energy levels.
It was this eflFect which Tomonaga, Feynman and Schwinger succeeded in determining correctly.


For situations in which sufficient energy is made available, one of the virtual photons surrounding an electron may be &ldquo;promoted&rdquo; to a real one.
This explains real photon emission when atoms release energy by making transitions to lower energy states.


This discussion implies that electrostatic fields are created by the activity of virtual photons.
The point of view of field theory is rather the other way about, the photons being thought of merely as the way in which electric fields interact with electron fields.
It is quite in order, however, to use either concept, depending on which is more appropriate to the problem at hand.



## The Strong-Force Field

A few years after it had been found that atomic nuclei are built of protons and neutrons, Hideki Yukawa, working toward his Ph.D. at Osaka University, undertook a theoretical study of the force which binds nucleons together.
The successful description of the electromagnetic force in terms of virtual photons suggested to him that the strong nuclear force might be accounted for in a similar manner.


It was known that this force does not decrease gradually toward zero with increasing distance; rather, its range ends abruptly at about 10<sup>&minus;13</sup> centimeter.
Yukawa concluded that the virtual parti cles associated with the strong-force field should be all of one mass.
Assuming that they dart out at velocities close to that of light, he could estimate that they exist for about 10<sup>&minus;23</sup> second; and from this value of <span class="math">&Delta;t</span> he calculated that their mass <span class="math">&Delta;m</span>, as given by the uncrtainty principle, is somewhat greater than two hundred electron masses.
Since particles having a mass intermediate between the electron and proton were unheard of at the time this prediction was made, it was received with considerable skepticism.


The way in which Yukawa&#39;s prediction was verified has already been discussed (page 144).
The pions discovered in cosmic-ray studies are the real particles, not the predicted virtual ones.
As is true of photons, virtual pions may be promoted to the real state if sufficient energy is provided.
In this manner pions are produced in considerable numbers in the violent collisions of protons or neutrons.


Further studies of the strong-force field have shown that its quanta include not only the three kinds of pions, but the other mesons, the kaons and eta particles, as well.
Just as electrons are centers surrounded by virtual photons, so protons and neutrons, and all the other baryons, are to be pictured as centers of darting virtual mesons.
A proton is constantly fluctuating between being just a proton and being a proton plus a neutral pion or a neutron plus a positive pion.
Similarly, a neutron may be just a neutron or a neutron plus a neutral pion or a proton plus a negative pion.
These fluctuations may be indicated thus:

The double-headed arrows imply that the interactions proceed in both directions.
Similarly, an antineutron may be at times a negative antiproton plus a positive pion.


The neutron, in fact, must be in the form of a proton plus a negative pion a good part of the time, for it acts as if it were a tiny magnet. Since magnetic effects are produced only by moving electric charge, the neutron cannot be devoid of charge; rather, it must have equal amounts of both kinds spinning together about a common axis.
The idea that both the proton and the neutron consist part of the time of central particles surrounded by charged pions is supported by experimental measurements of their magnetic effects, which are due mainly to the whirling pions.
In the protons, where this whirling charge is <em>positive</em>, the magnet and the mechanical spin point in the same direction; in the neutron with its <em>negative</em> pions the two are <em>opposed</em>.


Direct evidence for the complex structure of protons and neutrons has been obtained through bombardment experiments with high-energy electrons (page 135).
The proton experiments are carried out by bombarding ordinary hydrogen while the observations on neutrons are made with heavy hydrogen, whose atoms have nuclei which are proton-neutron pairs (since free neutrons in quantity are not available).
From observations on the scattering of the bombarding electrons, it is possible to determine the distribution of electric charge within the bombarded particles.
It is found that the pions have a range of about 10<sup>&minus;13</sup> centimeter, in agreement with Yukawa&#39;s theory.
This theory gives only the range of the strong force and yields no information about its strength or details of its nature.


Attempts have been made to formulate a theory of the <em>weak-force</em> field, involving yet another kind of unknown virtual particle.
All attempts to track down this W-<em>particle</em> experimentally have been unsuccessful.
Finally, the gravitational field is thought to be mediated by virtual <em>gravitons</em> which, like photons, must be massless since the gravitational field, like the electrical field, has a long range.
There is at present no expectation of observing real gravitons, for their creation in sensible amounts would require the violent agitation of huge masses.
The particles related to the four kinds of fields are the only ones not constrained by number conservation laws; all four may be created and destroyed freely in any numbers.


Force fields consisting of darting virtual photons and mesons are again a radically new conception regarding the nature of matter.
Material particles do not simply exist statically; they are centers of intense activity, of continual creation and annihilation.
Every atom is a seat of such activity.
In the nucleus there is a constant interplay of mesons, and the space around it is filled with swarms of virtual photons darting between the nucleus and the electrons.


## Action at a distance

Quantum field theory is, from one viewpoint, an attack on a problem of ancient origin, the problem of action at a distance. 
The natural philosophers of Aristotle&#39;s Lyceum may well have been puzzled to observe that a piece of rubbed amber exerts an attraction on bits of straw over a short intervening space, a phenomenon which eighteenth-century physicists would ascribe to the electric field in the vicinity of the charge on the amber.
But they were no doubt more concerned with the analogous but more conspicuous observation of the downward pull experienced by all objects on the surface of the earth.
Classical physics attributed this pull to the gravitational field which surrounds all pieces of matter but is of appreciable magnitude only near very large pieces such as the earth.
To say that a stone held in the hand is pulled downward because it is in the earth&#39;s gravitational field, however, is merely puting a name to ignorance.
It does not detract a whit from the mystery that the stone &ldquo;feels&rdquo; a pull with no visible or tangible agent acting upon it.


Isaac Newton, who formulated the law of action of the gravitational force, was well aware of this mystery.
In one of his letters to the classical scholar and divine Richard Bentley he expressed himself thus:

<blockquote>
    &hellip; that one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it.
</blockquote>


Newton saw clearly that his universal law of gravitation is a description not an <em>explanation</em>.
The German philosopher and mathematician Baron Gottfried von Leibnitz (1646-1716), among others of Newton&#39;s contemporaries, criticized his work on this account, holding that his famous formula for the gravitational force (<span class="math">F=Gm<sub>1</sub>m<sub>2</sub>/r<sup>2</sup></span>) is merely a rule of computation not worthy of being called a law of nature.
It was compared adversely with existing &ldquo;laws,&rdquo; with Aristotle&#39;s animistic explanation of the stone&#39;s fall as due to its &ldquo;desire&rdquo; to return to its &ldquo;natural place&rdquo; on the ground, and with Descartes&#39;s conception of the planets caught up in huge ether whirlpools carrying them on their orbits around the sun.

This unjust valuation of his work was repudiated in many of Newton&#39;s writings, as in the following passage from his Optics:

<blockquote>
    mo tell us that every species of thing is endow&#39;d with an occult specific quality, by which it acts and produces manifest effects, is to tell us nothing.
    But to derive two or three general principles of motion from phenomena, and afterwards to tell us how the properties and actions of all corporeal things follow from these principles would be a very great step in philosophy, though the causes of those principles were not yet discovered.
</blockquote>

Concerning his law of gravitation, which he discussed in the <em>Principia</em>, Newton made his position clear:

<blockquote>
    I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses &hellip;
    It is enough that gravity does really exist and acts according to the laws I have explained, and that it abundantly serves to account for all the motions of celestial bodies.
</blockquote>

This quotation shows how thoroughly Newton espoused the experimental philosophy.
He clearly expected that, if ever the &ldquo;cause&rdquo; of gravity is found, it will be deduced &ldquo;from phenomena,&rdquo; that is, from experimental observations, and that in the meantime it is advisable to &ldquo;frame no hypotheses.&rdquo;


The conception of fields of force as streams of virtual particles supplies the means &ldquo;through which their action and force may be conveyed,&rdquo; which Newton so urgently demanded.
It mitigates the problem of action at a distance, for with virtual photons producing the electric field, what happens to the electron happens at the electron.


Here is a lesson about the need for caution as to what &ldquo;makes sense&rdquo; in science.
Nothing would seem more sensible than the observation that a stone tossed into the air falls back to earth; it would be surprising if the stone failed to do so.
Yet upon closer study this simple event is seen to involve the metaphysical difficulties of action at a distance, difficulties which achieve a measure of intuitive resolution only in terms of the strange conception of virtual gravitons.
This may serve as a warning that what passes for an understanding of simple things may well be no more than a tacit consensus to stop asking questions.
