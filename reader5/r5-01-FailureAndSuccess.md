Almost as soon as I took up the problem again, it struck me in a new light.
All my other attempts have been absurd, I thought: if I turn them down and make another guess, then what? The guess didn&#39;t seem probable; but none of the others was any good at all.
According to my guess, the structure was very different from anything one would have imagined; but that must be true, since the obvious structure didn&#39;t fit any of my facts.
Soon I was designing structures with little knobs of plasticine for atoms and steel wires to hold them together; I made up the old ones, for comparison&#39;s sake, and then I built my new one, which looked very odd, very different from any structure I had ever seen.
Yet I was excited&mdash;&ldquo;I think it works,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think it works.&rdquo;

For I had brought back to mind some calculations of the scattering curves, assuming various models.
None of the values had been anything like the truth.
I saw at once that the new structure ought to give something much nearer.
Hurriedly I calculated: it was a long and tiresome and complicated piece of arithmetic, but I rushed through it, making mistakes through impatience and having to go over it again.
I was startled when I got the answer: the new model did not give perfect agreement, but it was far closer than any of the others.
So far as I remember, the real value at one point was 1.32, my previous three models gave 1.1, 1.65 and 1.7, and the new one just under 1.4.
&lsquoI&#39;m on it, at last,&rsquo; I thought.
&lsquo;It&#39;s a long shot, but I&#39;m on it at last.&rsquo;



For a fortnight I sifted all the evidence from the experiments since I first attacked the problem.
There were a great many tables of figures, and a pile of X-ray photographs (for in my new instrument in Cambridge I was using a photographic detector); and I had been through most of them so often that I knew them almost by heart.
But I went through them again, more carefully than ever, trying to interpret them in the light of the new structure.
&lsquo;If it&#39;s right,&rsquo; I was thinking, &lsquo;then these figures ought to run up to a maximum and then run down quickly.&rsquo;
And they did, though the maximum was less sharp than it should have been.
And so on through experiments which represented the work of over a year; they all fitted the structure, with an allowance for a value a shade too big here, a trifle too small there.
There were obviously approximations to make, I should have to modify the structure a little, but that it was on the right lines I was certain.
I walked to my rooms to lunch one morning, overflowing with pleasure; I wanted to tell someone the news; I waved violently to a man whom I scarcely knew, riding by on a bicycle: I thought of sending a wire to Audrey, but decided to go and see her on the following day instead: King&#39;s Parade seemed a particularly admirable street, and young men shouting across it were all admirable young men.
I had a quick lunch; I wanted to bask in satisfaction, but instead I hurried back to the laboratory so that I could have it all finished with no loose ends left, and then rest for a while.
I was feeling the after-taste of effort.


There were four photographs left to inspect.
They had been taken earlier in the week and I had looked over them once.
Now they had to be definitely measured and entered, and the work was complete.
I ran over the first, it was everything I expected.
The structure was fitting even better than in the early experiments.
And the second: I lit a cigarette.
Then the third: I gazed over the black dots.
All was well&mdash;and then, with a thud of the heart that shook me, I saw behind each distinct black dot another fainter speck.
The bottom had fallen out of everything: I was wrong, utterly wrong.
I hunted round for another explanation: the film might be a false one, it might be a fluke experiment; but the look of it mocked me: far from being false, it was the only experiment where I had arrived at precisely the right conditions.


Could it be explained any other way?
I stared down at the figures, the sheets of results which I had forced into my scheme.
My cheeks flushing dry, I tried to work this new photograph into my idea.
An improbable assumption, another improbable assumption, a possibility of experimental error&mdash;I went on, fantastically, any sort of criticism forgotten.
Still it would not fit.
I was wrong, irrevocably wrong.
I should have to begin again.

Then I began to think: If I had not taken this photograph, what would have happened?
Very easily I might not have taken it.
I should have been satisfied with my idea: everyone else would have been.
The evidence is overwhelming, except for this. I should have pulled off a big thing. I should be made.
Sooner or later, of course, someone would do this experiment, and I should be shown to be wrong: but it would be a long time ahead, and mine would have been an honourable sort of mistake.
On my evidence I should have been right.
That is the way everyone would have looked at it.


I suppose, for a moment, I wanted to destroy the photograph.
It was all beyond my conscious mind.
And I was swung back, also beyond my conscious mind, by all the forms of&mdash;shall I call it &ldquo;conscience&rdquo;&mdash;and perhaps more than that, by the desire which had thrown me into the search.
For I had to get to what I myself thought was the truth.
Honour, comfort and ambition were bound to move me, but I think my own desire went deepest.
Without any posturing to myself, without any sort of conscious thought, I laughed at the temptation to destroy the photograph.
Rather shakily I laughed. And I wrote in my note-book:

<blockquote>
    Mar. 30: Photograph 3 alone has secondary dots, concentric with major dots.
    This removes all possibility of the hypothesis of structure B.
    The interpretation from Mar. 4&ndash;30 must accordingly be disregarded.
</blockquote>

From that day I understood, as I never had before, the frauds that creep into science every now and then.
Sometimes they must be quite unconscious: the not-seeing of facts because they are inconvenient, the delusions of one&#39;s own senses. As though in my case I had not seen, because my unconscious self chose not to see, the secondary ring of dots.
Sometimes, more rarely, the fraud must be nearer to consciousness; that is, the fraud must be realised, even though the man cannot control it.
That was the point of my temptation. It could only be committed by a man in whom the scientific passion was weaker for the time than the ordinary desires for place or money.
Sometimes it would be done, impulsively, by men in whom no faith was strong; and they could forget it cheerfully themselves and go on to do good and honest work.
Sometimes it would be done by a man who reproached himself all his life.
I think I could pick out most kinds of fraud from among the mistakes I have seen; after that afternoon I could not help being tolerant towards them.


For myself, there was nothing left to do but start again.
I looked over the entry in my note-book; the ink was still shining, and yet it seemed to have stood, final, leaving me no hope, for a long time.
Because I had nothing better to do, I made a list of the structures I had invented and, in the end, discarded.
There were four of them now.
Slowly, I devised another, I felt sterile.
I distrusted it; and when I tried to test it, to think out its properties, I had to force my mind to work. I sat until six o&#39;clock, working profitlessly; and when I walked out, and all through the night, the question was gnawing at me: &#39;What is this structure?
Shall I ever get it?
Where am I going wrong?&#39;


I had never had two sleepless nights together before that week.
Fulfillment deferred had hit me; I had to keep from reproaching myself that I had already wasted months over this problem, and now, just as I could consolidate my work, I was on the way to wasting another year.
I went to bed late and heard the Cambridge clocks, one after another, chime out the small hours; I would have ideas with the uneasy clarity of night, switch on my light, scribble in my note-book, look at my watch, and try to sleep again; I would rest a little and wake up with a start, hoping that it was morning, to find that I had slept for twenty minutes: until I lay awake in a grey dawn, with all my doubts pressing in on me as I tried with tired eyes to look into the future.
&lsquo;What is the structure?
What line must I take?&rsquo;
And then, as an under-theme, &lsquo;Am I going to fail at my first big job?
Am I always going to be a competent worker doing little problems?&rsquo;
And another, &lsquo;I shah be twenty-six in the winter: I ought to be established.
But shall I be getting anywhere?&rsquo;
My ideas, that seemed hopeful when I got out of bed to write them, were ridiculous when I saw them in this cold light.


This went on for three nights, until my work in the daytime was only a pretence.
Then there came a lull, when I forgot my worry for a night and slept until mid-day.
But, though I woke refreshed, the questions began to whirl round again in my mind.
For days it went on, and I could find no way out.
I walked twenty miles one day, along the muddy fen-roads between the town and Ely, in order to clear my head; but it only made me very tired, and I drank myself to sleep.
Another night I went to a play, but I was listening not to the actors&#39; words, but to others that formed themselves inside me and were giving me no rest.



## IV

I started.
My thoughts had stopped going back upon themselves.
As I had been watching Audrey&#39;s eyes, an idea had flashed through the mist, quite unreasonably, illogically.
It had no bearing at all on any of the hopeless attempts I had been making; I had explored every way, I thought, but this was new; and, too agitated to say even to myself that I believed it, I took out some paper and tried to work it out.
Audrey was staring with intent eyes. I could not get very far.
I wanted my results and tables.
But everything I could put down rang true.


&ldquo;An idea&#39;s just come to me,&rdquo; I explained, pretending to be calm.
&ldquo;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything in it.
But there might be a little.
But anyway I ought to try it out.
And I haven&#39;t my books.
Do you mind if we go back pretty soon?&rdquo;
I fancy I was getting up from the table, for Audrey smiled.

&ldquo;I&#39;m glad you had some excuse for not listening,&rdquo; she said.

She drove back very fast, not speaking.
I made my plans for the work.
It couldn&#39;t take less than a week, I thought.
I sat hunched up, telling myself that it might all be wrong again; but the structure was taking shape, and a part of me was beginning to laugh at my caution.
Once I turned and saw Audrey&#39;s profile against the fields; but after a moment I was back in the idea.


When I got out at the Cavendish gateway, she stayed in the car.
&ldquo;You&#39;d better be alone,&rdquo; she said.

&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&#39;ll sit in Green Street.&rdquo;
She stayed there regularly on her week-end visits.

I hesitated. &ldquo;It&#39;s&mdash;&rdquo;

She smiled.
&ldquo;I&#39;ll expect you to-night.
About ten o&#39;clock,&rdquo; she said.

## V


I saw very little of Audrey that week-end.
When I went to her, my mind was active, my body tired, and despite myself it was more comfort than love I asked of her.
I remember her smiling, a little wryly, and saying: &ldquo;When this is over, we&#39;ll go away. Right away.&rdquo;
I buried my head against her knees, and she stroked my hair.
When she left me on the Monday morning, we clung to each other for a long time.


For three weeks I was thrusting the idea into the mass of facts.
I could do nothing but calculate, read up new facts, satisfy myself that I had made no mistakes in measuring up the plates: I developed an uncontrollable trick of not being sure whether I had made a particular measurement correctly: repeating it: and then, after a day, the uncertainty returned, and to ease my mind I had to repeat it once more.
I could scarcely read a newspaper or write a letter.
Whatever I was doing, I was not at rest unless it was taking me towards the problem; and even then it was an unsettled rest, like lying in a fever half-way to sleep.


And yet, for all the obsessions, I was gradually being taken over by a calm which was new to me.
I was beginning to feel an exultation, but it was peaceful, as different from wild triumph as it was from the ache in my throbbing nerves.
For I was beginning to feel in my heart that I was near the truth.
Beyond surmise, beyond doubt, I felt that I was nearly right; even as I lay awake in the dawn, or worked irritably with flushed cheeks, I was approaching a serenity which made the discomforts as trivial as those of someone else&#39;s body.


It was after Easter now and Cambridge was almost empty.
I was glad; I felt free as I walked the deserted streets.
One night, when I left the laboratory, after an evening when the new facts were falling into line and making the structure seem more than ever true, it was good to pass under the Cavendish!
Good to be in the midst of the great days of science! Good to be adding to the record of those great days!
And good to walk down King&#39;s Parade and see the Chapel standing against a dark sky without any stars!


The mingling of strain and certainty, of personal worry and deeper peace, was something I had never known before.
Even at the time, 1 knew I was living in a strange happiness.
Or, rather, I knew that when it was over I should covet its memory.


And so for weeks I was alone in the laboratory, taking photographs, gazing under the red lamp at films which still dripped water, carrying them into the light and studying them until I knew every grey speck on them, from the points which were testing my structures down to flaws and scratches on the surface.
Then, when my eyes tired, I put down my lens and turned to the sheets of figures that contained the results, the details of the structure and the predictions I was able to make.
Often I would say&mdash;if this structure is right, then this crystal here will have its oxygen atom 1.2 a.u. from the nearest carbon; and the crystal will break along this axis, and not along that; and it will be harder than the last crystal I measured, but not so hard as the one before, and so on.
For days my predictions were not only vaguely right, but right as closely as I could measure.


I still possess those lists of figures, and I have stopped writing to look over them again.
It is ten years and more since I first saw them and yet as I read:

<figure>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Predicted</th>
    <th>Observed</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.435</td>
    <td>1.44</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.603</td>
    <td>2.603</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</figure>

and so on for long columns, I am warmed with something of that first glow.


At last it was almost finished.
I had done everything I could; and to make an end of it I thought out one prediction whose answer was irrefutable.
There was one more substance in the organic group which I could not get in England, which had only been made in Munich; if my general structure was right, the atoms in its lattice could only have one pattern.
For any other structure the pattern would be utterly different.
An X-ray photograph of the crystal would give me all I wanted in a single day.


It was tantalising, not having the stuff to hand, I could write and get some from Munich, but it would take a week, and a week was very long. Yet there seemed nothing else to do.
I was beginning to write in my clumsy scientist&#39;s German&mdash;and then I remembered L&uuml;thy, who had returned to Germany a year ago.


I cabled to him, asking if he would get a crystal and photograph it on his instrument.
It would only take him a morning at the most, I thought, and we had become friendly enough for me to make the demand on him.
Later in the afternoon I had his answer: &ldquo;I have obtained crystal will telegraph result to-morrow honoured to assist. L&uuml;thy.&rdquo;
I smiled at the &ldquo;honoured to assist&rdquo;, which he could not possibly have left out, and sent off another cable: &ldquo;Predict symmetry and distances &hellip; &rdquo;


<br />
Then I had twenty-four hours of waiting.
Moved by some instinct to touch wood, I wanted to retract the last cable as soon as I had sent it.
If&mdash;if I were wrong, no one else need know.
But it had gone.
And, nervous as I was, in a way I knew that I was right.
Yet I slept very little that night; I could mock, with all the detached part of myself, at the tricks my body was playing, but it went on playing them.
I had to leave my breakfast, and drank cup after cup of tea, and kept throwing away cigarettes I had just lighted.
I watched myself do these things, but I could not stop them, in just the same way as one can watch one&#39;s own body being afraid.


The afternoon passed, and no telegram came.
I persuaded myself there was scarcely time.
I went out for an hour, in order to find it at my rooms when I returned.
I went through all the antics and devices of waiting.
I grew empty with anxiety as the evening drew on.
I sat trying to read; the room was growing dark, but I did not wish to switch on the light, for fear of bringing home the passage of the hours.


At last the bell rang below.
I met my landlady on the stairs, bringing in the telegram.
I do not know whether she noticed that my hands were shaking as I opened it.
It said: &ldquo;Felicitations on completely accurate prediction which am proud to confirm apologise for delay due to instrumental adjustments.
L&uuml;thy.&rdquo;
I was numbed for a moment; I could only see L&uuml;thy bowing politely to the postal clerk as he sent off the telegram.
I laughed, and I remember it had a queer sound.


Then I was carried beyond pleasure.
I have tried to show something of the high moments that science gave to me; the night my father talked about the stars, Luard&#39;s lesson, Austin&#39;s opening lecture, the end of my first research.
But this was different from any of them, different altogether, different in kind.
It was further from myself My own triumph and delight and success were there, but they seemed insignificant beside this tranquil ecstasy.
It was as though I had looked for a truth outside myself, and finding it had become for a moment part of the truth I sought; as though all the world, the atoms and the stars, were wonderfully clear and close to me, and I to them, so that we were part of a lucidity more tremendous than any mystery.


I had never known that such a moment could exist.
Some of its quality, perhaps, I had captured in the delight which came when I brought joy to Audrey, being myself content; or in the times among friends, when for some rare moment, maybe twice in my life, I had lost myself in a common purpose; but these moments had, as it were, the tone of the experience without the experience itself.


Since then I have never quite regained it.
But one effect will stay with me as long as I live; once, when I was young, I used to sneer at the mystics who have described the experience of being at one with God and part of the unity of things.
After that afternoon, I did not want to laugh again; for though I should have interpreted the experience differently, I thought I knew what they meant.
