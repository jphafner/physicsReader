At the age of twentysix, and quite unknown, he published three revolutionary papers in theoretical physics in 1905. 
The first paper extended Max Planck&#39;s ideas of quantization of energy, and established the quantum theory of radiation. 
For this work he received the Nobel Prize for 1921. 
The second paper gave a mathematical theory of Brownian motion, yielding a calculation of the size of a molecule. 
His third paper founded the special theory of relativity.

His work hod a profound influence not only on physics, but olso on philosophy. 
An eloquent and widely beloved man, Einstein took an active part in liberal and anti-war movements.

## Sir Joseph John Thomson

Sir Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940) was born near Manchester, England. 
At fourteen he entered a college in Manchester, at twenty he entered Cambridge on a scholarship, and at twenty-seven became professor of physics at Cambridge. 
It was Thomson whose work ushered in the period of subatomic research when he showed conclusively that &ldquo;cathode rays&rdquo; consisted of electrons. With this a* a building block he constructed the &ldquo;Thomson&rdquo; model of the atom&emdash;a sphere of positive electricity in which were embedded negatively charged electrons. 
In 1906 J. J. Thomson was awarded the Nobel Prize, and in 1908 he was knighted. 
During Thomson&#39;s period as Director of the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge, eight Nobel Prizes were won by his colleagues. 
With this start England remained the leader in subatomic experimental physics for almost forty years.
