The French novelist Stendhal began his most brilliant novel with this sentence: &ldquo;On May 15, 1796, General Bonaparte made his entrance into Milan at the head of that youthful army which had just crossed the bridge of Lodi, and taught the world that after so many centuries Caesar and Alexander had a successor.&rdquo; 
In its military context, the quotation is irrelevant here, but it can be paraphrased a bit: almost exactly a century later Milan saw the arrival of another young foreigner who would soon teach the world that after so many centuries Galileo and Newton had a successor. 
It would, however, have taken super- human insight to recognize the future intellectual conqueror in the boy of fifteen who had just crossed the Alps from Munich. 
For this boy, Albert Einstein, whose name was to become a symbol for profound scientific insight, had left Munich as what we would now call a high-school dropout. 


He had been a slow child; he learned to speak at a much later age than the average, and he had shown no special ability in elementary school â€”except perhaps a talent for day-dreaming. 
The education offered at his secondary school in Munich, one of the highly praised classical gymnasia, did not appeal to him. 
The rigid, mechanical methods of the school appealed to him even less. 
He had already begun to develop his own intellectual pursuits, but the stimulus for them had not come from school. 
The mystery hidden in the compass given to him when he was five, the clarity and beauty of Euclidean geometry, discovered by devouring an old geometry text at the age of twelve&emdash;it was these things that set him on his own road of independent study and thought. 
The drill at school merely served to keep him from his own interests. When his father, a small and unsuccessful manufacturer, moved his business and his family from Munich to Milan, Albert Einstein was left behind to finish his schooling and acquire the diploma he would need to insure his future. 
After some months, however, Einstein was fed up with school, and resolved to leave. 
His leaving was assisted by the way in which his teachers reacted to his attitude toward school. 
&ldquo;You will never amount to anything, Einstein,&rdquo; one of them said, and another actually suggested that Einstein leave school because his very presence in the classroom destroyed the respect of the students. 
This suggestion was gratefully accepted by Einstein, since it fit so well with his own decisions, and he set off to join his family in Milan. 
The next months were spent gloriously loafing, and hiking around northern Italy, enjoying the many contrasts with his homeland. 
With no diploma, and no prospects, he seemed a very model dropout. 


It is sobering to think that no teacher had sensed his potentialities. 
Perhaps it suggests why I have chosen this subject in talking to this gathering of physics teachers seriously devoted to improving education in physics, and devoted in particular to a program aimed at the gifted student of our science&emdash;at his early detection and proper treatment. 
For what I really want to do is to highlight some aspects of Einstein&#39;s career and thought that stand in sharp contrast to a number of our accepted ideas on education and on the scientific career. 
The first matter we must reckon with is Einstein&#39;s own education and the way it affected him; but let me carry the story a little further before raising some questions. 


Einstein had dropped out of school, but he had not lost his love for science. 
Since his family&#39;s resources, or lack of them, would make it necessary for him to become self-supporting, he decided to go on with his scientific studies in an official way. 
He, therefore, presented himself for admission at the renowned Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. 
Since he had no highschool diploma he was given an entrance examination&emdash;and he failed. 
He had to attend a Swiss high school for a year in order to make up his deficiencies in almost everything except mathematics and physics, the subjects of his own private study. 
And then, when he was finally admitted to the Polytechnic Institute, did he settle down and assume what we would consider to be his rightful place at the head of the class? 
Not at all.  
Despite the fact that the courses were now almost all in mathematics and physics, Einstein cut most of the lectures. 
He did enjoy working in the labbratory, but he spent most of his time in his room studying the original works of the masters of nineteenth-century physics, and pondering what they set forth. 


The lectures on advanced mathematics did not hold him, because in those days he saw no need or use for higher mathematics as a tool for grasping the structure of nature. 
Besides, mathematics appeared to be split into so many branches, each of which could absorb all one&#39;s time and energy, that he feared he could never have the insight to decide on one of them, the fundamental one. 
He would then be in the position of Buridan&#39;s ass, who died of hunger because he could not decide which bundle of hay he should eat. 


Physics presented no such problems to Einstein, even then. As he wrote many years later: &ldquo;True enough, physics was also divided into separate fields, each of which could devour a short working life without having satisfied the hunger for deeper knowledge &hellip;
But in physics I soon learned to scent out the paths that led to the depths, and to disregard everything else, all the many things that clutter up the mind, and divert it from the essential. 
The hitch in this was, of course, the fact that one had to cram all this stuff into one&#39;s mind for the examination, whether one liked it or not.&rdquo; 


That was indeed the rub. 
Einstein had reconciled himself to being only an average scholar at the Polytechnic. 
He knew that he did not have and could not, or perhaps would not, acquire the traits of the outstanding student: the easy facility in comprehension, the willingness to concentrate one&#39;s energies on all the required subjects, and the orderliness to take good notes and work them over properly. 
Fortunately, however, the Swiss system required only two examinations. 
Even more fortunately Einstein had a close friend, Marcel Grossmann, who possessed just the qualities that Einstein lacked, and who generously shared his excellent systematic notes with his nonconforming comrade. 
So Einstein was able to follow his own line of study, and still succeed in the exams by doing some appropriate cramming from Grossmann&#39;s notes. 
This success left more than a bad taste in his mouth. 
As he put it, &ldquo;It had such a deterring effect upon me that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year.&rdquo; 
and he went on to say, &ldquo;It is little short of a miracle that modern methods of instruction have not already completely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry, because what this delicate little plant needs most, apart from initial stimulation, is freedom; without that it is surely destroyed &hellip; 
I believe that one could even deprive a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness, if one could force it with a whip to eat continuously whether it were hungry or not &hellip; &rdquo;

This is strong language. 
Should we take it personally? 
Could it be meant for us, for the teachers responsible for an educational system of achievement tests, preliminary college boards, college boards, national scholarships, grade point averages, graduate record exams, PhD qualifying exams&emdash;a system that starts earlier and earlier and ends later and later in our students&#39; careers? 
Could this system be dulling the appetites of our young intellectual tigers? 
Is it possible that our students need more time to day-dream rather than more hours in the school day? 
That the relentless pressure of our educational system makes everything only a step toward something else and nothing an end in itself and an object of pleasure and contemplation?

For almost two years after his graduation from the Polytechnic in 1900 Einstein seemed to be headed for no more success than his earlier history as a dropout might have suggested. 
He applied for an assistantship, but it went to someone else. 
During this period he managed to subsist on the odd jobs of the learned world: he substituted for a Swiss high-school teacher who was doing his two months of military service, he helped the professor of astronomy with some calculations, he tutored at a boys&#39; school. 
Finally, in the spring of 1902, Einstein&#39;s good friend Marcel Grossmann, &ldquo;the irreproachable student&rdquo;, came to his rescue. 
Grossmann&#39;s father recommended Einstein to the director of the Swiss Patent Office at Berne, and after a searching examination he was appointed to a position as patent examiner. 
He held this position for over seven years and often referred to it in later years as &ldquo;a kind of salvation&rdquo;. 
It freed him from financial worries; he found the work rather interesting; and sometimes it served as a stimulus to his scientific imagination. 
And besides, it occupied only eight hours of the day, so that there was plenty of time left free for pondering the riddles of the universe. 


In his spare time during those seven years at Berne, the young patent examiner wrought a series of scientific miracles: no weaker word is adequate. 
He did nothing less than to lay out the main lines along which twentieth-century theoretical physics has developed. 
A very brief list will have to suffice. 
He began by working out the subject of statistical mechanics quite independently and without knowing of the work of J. Willard Gibbs. 
He also took this subject seriously in a way that neither Gibbs nor Boltzmann had ever done, since he used it to give the theoretical basis for a final proof of the atomic nature of matter. 
His reflections on the problems of the Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics led him to create the special theory of relativity. 
Before he left Berne he had formulated the principle of equivalence and was struggling with the problems of gravitation which he later solved with the general theory of relativity. 
And, as if these were not enough, Einstein introduced another new idea into physics, one that even he described as &ldquo;very revolutionary&rdquo;, the idea that light consists of particles of energy. 
Following a line of reasoning related to but quite distinct from Planck&#39;s, Einstein not only introduced the light quantum hypothesis, but proceeded almost at once to explore its implications for phenomena as diverse as photochemistry and the temperature dependence of the specific heat of solids. 


What is more, Einstein did all this completely on his own, with no academic connections whatsoever, and with essentially no contact with the elders of his profession. 
Years later he remarked to Leopold Infeld that until he was almost thirty he had never seen a real theoretical physicist. 
To which, of course, we should add the phrase (as Infeld almost did aloud, and as Einstein would never have done), &ldquo;except in the mirror!&rdquo; 


I suppose that some of us might be tempted to wonder what Einstein might have done during those seven years, if he had been able to work &ldquo;under really favorable conditions&rdquo;, full time, at a major university, instead of being restricted to spare-tirrie activity while earning his living as a minor civil servant. 
We should resist the temptation: our speculations would be not only fruitless, but completely unfounded. 
For not only did Einstein not regret his lack of an academic post in these years, he actually considered it a real advantage. 
&ldquo;For an academic career puts a young man into a kind of embarrassing position,&rdquo; he wrote shortly before his death, &ldquo;by requiring him to produce scientific publications in impressive quantity&emdash;a seduction into superficiality which only strong characters are able to withstand. 
Most practical occupations, however, are of such a nature that a man of normal ability is able to accomplish what is expected of him. 
His day-to-day existence does not depend on any special illuminations. 
If he has deeper scientific interests he may plunge into his favorite problems in addition to doing his required work. 
He need not be oppressed by the fear that his efforts may lead to no results. 
I owed it to Marcel Grossmann that I was in such a fortunate position.&rdquo; 


These were no casual remarks: forty years earlier Einstein had told Max Born not to worry about placing a gifted student in an academic position. 
Let him be a cobbler or a locksmith; if he really has a love for science in his blood and if he&#39;s really worth anything, he will make his own way. 
(Of course, Einstein then gave what help he could in placing the young man.) 
Einstein was even a little reluctant about accepting a research professorship at Berlin, partly because Prussian rigidity and academic bourgeois life were not to his Bohemian taste. 
But he was also reluctant because he knew very well that such a research professor was expected to be a sort of prize hen, and he did not want to guarantee that he would lay any more golden eggs. 


It will not have escaped your notice that Einstein&#39;s views on research and the nature of a scientific career differ sharply from those which are standard in the scientific community. 
No doubt some of this difference in attitude reflects only Einstein&#39;s uniquely solitary nature. 
It is hard to imagine anyone else seriously suggesting as he did, that a position as lighthouse keeper might be suitable for a scientist. 
Most scientists feel the need to test their ideas on their peers, and often to form these ideas in the give and take of discussions, as among their most urgent needs. 
One may still question the necessity of as many meetings as we find announced in Physics Today, and one may question even more insistently the necessity of reporting on each and publishing its proceedings as if it were the first Solvay Congress itself. 


More serious is the attitude that every young man of scientific ability can claim the right to a position as prize hen. 
&ldquo;Doing research&rdquo; has become the hallowed activity in the academic world, and, as Jacques Barzun has put it, &ldquo;To suggest that practice, or teaching, or reflection might be preferred is blasphemy.&rdquo; 
I do not need to re-emphasize Einstein&#39;s remark on the publish-or-perish policy that corrupts one aspect of academic life. 
I would, however, like to remark parenthetically that I am always astonished when college administrators and department heads claim that it is terribly difficult, virtually impossible, to judge the quality of a man&#39;s teaching, but never doubt their ability to evaluate the results of his research. 
This is astonishing because any honest undergraduate can give a rather canny and usually accurate appraisal of the teaching he is subjected to, but judging the quality of a scientific paper generally increases in difficulty with the originality of the work reported. 
Einstein&#39;s hypothesis of light quanta, for example, was considered as wildly off the mark, as at best a pardonable excess in an otherwise sound thinker, even by Planck a decade after it was introduced. 
The way in which physics is taught is deeply influenced by our views of how and why physics is done. 
Einstein, who was skeptical about the professionalization of research, was unswerving in his pursuit of fundamental understanding; he was a natural philosopher in the fullest sense of that old term, and he had no great respect for those who treated science as a game to be played for one&#39;s personal satisfaction, or those who solved problems to demonstrate and maintain their intellectual virtuosity. 
If physics is viewed in Einstein&#39;s way, it follows that it should be taught as a drama of ideas and not as a battery of techniques. 
It follows too that there should be an emphasis on the evolution of ideas, on the history of our attempts to understand the physical world, so that our students acquire some perspective and realize that, in Einstein&#39;s words, &ldquo;the present position of science can have no lasting significance.&rdquo; 
Do we keep this liberal view of our science, or is it lost in what we call necessary preparation for graduate work and research? 


One last theme that cannot be ignored when we speak of Einstein is that of the scientist as citizen. 
Einstein&#39;s active and courageous role in public affairs is widely known, and it absorbed a substantial fraction of his efforts for forty years. 
He stepped onto the public stage early and in characteristic style. 
In October 1914, two months after the outbreak of the First World War, a document was issued in Berlin bearing the grandiose title. 
Manifesto to the Civilized World; it carried the signatures of almost a himdred of Germany&#39;s most prominent scientists, artists, men of letters, clergymen, etc. 
This manifesto proclaimed its signers&#39; fidl support of Germany&#39;s war effort, denoimced the opponents of the fatherland, and defiantly asserted that German militarism and German culture formed an inseparable unity. 


Not all German intellectuals approved this chauvinistic document, but among the very few who were willing to sign a sharply worded answer, calling for an end to war and an international organization, was Albert Einstein. 
The highly unpopular stand that he took in 1914 expressed a deeply felt conviction, one on which he acted throughout his life, regardless of the consequences to himself. 
During the succeeding decades Einstein devoted a great deal of his energy to the causes in which he believed, lending his name to many organizations which he felt could further these causes. 
Contrary to the view held in some circles, however, Einstein carefully considered each signature that he inscribed on a petition, each political use that he made of the name that had become renowned for scientific reasons, and often refused his support to organizations that attempted to solicit it.

His public statements became even more frequent and more outspoken in the years after the Second World War, as he put all his weight behind the effort to achieve a world government and to abolish war once and for all. 
Einstein was among those who have been trying to impress upon the world the very real likelihood that another war would destroy civilization and perhaps humanity as well. He was not overly optimistic about his efforts, but they had to be made. 
He also felt that he had to speak out, loudly and clearly, during the McCarthy era, urging intellectuals to adopt the method of civil disobedience as practiced earlier by Gandhi (and later by Martin Luther King).
As he wrote in an open letter, &ldquo;Every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to refuse to testify; i.e., he must be prepared for jail and economic ruin, in short, for the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country.&rdquo; 
If such a program were not adopted then, wrote Einstein, &ldquo;the intellectuals of this country deserve nothing better than the slavery which is intended for them.&rdquo; 


It is quite evident that Einstein approached political and social questions as a man who considered himself outside the Establishment. 
He had a very strong sense of responsibility to his conscience, but he did not feel obliged to accept all the restrictions that society expects of a &ldquo;responsible spokesman&rdquo;. 
This approach is neither possible nor appropriate for today&#39;s leading scientists who are constantly serving as scientific statesmen&emdash;as advisers to the AEC, or the Department of Defense, or major corporations, or even the President. 
Such men are in no position to adopt Einstein&#39;s critical stance, even if they wanted to. 
At this time, when science requires and receives such large-scale support, it seems that we have all given more hostages to fortune than we may realize. 


One of Einstein&#39;s last public statements was made in answer to a request that he comment on the situation of scientists in America. 
He wrote: &ldquo;Instead of trying to analyze the problem I should like to express my feeling in a short remark. 
If I were a young man again and had to decide how to make a living, I would not try to become a scientist or scholar or teacher. 
I would rather choose to be a plumber or a peddler, in the hope of finding that modest degree of independence still available under present circumstances.&rdquo; 


We may wonder how literally he meant this to be taken, but we cannot help feeling the force of the affront to our entire institutionalized life of the intellect. 


As we pride ourselves on the success of physics and physicists in today&#39;s world, let us not forget that it was just that success and the way in which it was achieved that was repudiated by Einstein. 
And let us not forget to ask why: it may tell us something worth knowing about ourselves and our society.
