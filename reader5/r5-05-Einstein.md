<span class="textsc">I came to Princeton</span> on a Saturday, lived through a dead Sunday and entered the office of Fine Hall on Monday, to make my first acquaintances.
I asked the secretary when I could see Einstein. 
She telephoned him, and the answer was:

&ldquo;Professor Einstein wants to see you right away.&rdquo;

I knocked at the door of 209 and heard a loud &ldquo;<em>herein</em>.&rdquo;
When I opened the door I saw a hand stretched out energetically.
It was Einstein, looking older than when I had met him in Berlin, older than the elapsed sixteen years should have made him.
His long hair was gray, his face tired and yellow, but he had the same radiant deep eyes.
He wore the brown leather jacket in which he has appeared in so many pictures.
(Someone had given it to him to wear when sailing, and he had liked it so well that he dressed in it every day.) His shirt was without a collar, his brown trousers creased, and he wore shoes without socks.
I expected a brief private conversation, questions about my crossing, Europe, Born, etc. Nothing of the kind:

&ldquo;Do you speak German?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered.

&ldquo;Perhaps I can tell you on what I am working.&rdquo;

Quietly he took a piece of chalk, went to the blackboard and started to deliver a perfect lecture.
The calmness with which Einstein spoke was striking.
There was nothing of the restlessness of a scientist who, explaining the problems with which he has lived for years, assumes that they are equally familiar to the listener and proceeds quickly with his exposition.
Before going into details Einstein sketched the philosophical background for the problems on which he was working.
Walking slowly and with dignity around the room, going to the blackboard from time to time to write down mathematical equations, keeping a dead pipe in his mouth, he formed his sentences perfectly.
Everything that he said could have been printed as he said it and every sentence would make perfect sense.
The exposition was simple, profound and clear.


I listened carefully and understood everything.
The ideas behind Einstein's papers are aways so straightforward and fundamental that I believe I shall be able to express some of them in simple language.


There are two fundamental concepts in the development of physics: <em>field</em> and <em>matter</em>.
The old physics which developed from Galileo and Newton, up to the middle of the nineteenth century, is a physics of matter.
The old mechanical point of view is based upon the belief that we can explain all phenomena in nature by assuming particles and simple forces acting among them.
In mechanics, while investigating the motion of the planets around the sun, we have the most triumphant model of the old view.
Sun and planets are treated as particles, with the forces among them depending only upon their relative distances.
The forces decrease if the distances increase.
This is a typical model which the mechanist would like to apply, with some unessential changes, to the description of all physical phenomena.


A container with gas is, for the physicist, a conglomeration of small particles in haphazard motion.
Here&mdash;from the planetary system to a gas&mdash;we pass in one great step from &ldquo;macrophysics&rdquo; to &ldquo;microphysics,&rdquo; from phenomena accessible to our immediate observation to phenomena described by pictures of particles with masses so small that they lie beyond any possibility of direct measurement.
It is our &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; picture of gas, to which there is no immediate access for our senses, a microphysical picture which we are forced to form in order to understand experience.

Again this picture is of a mechanical nature.
The forces among the particles of a gas depend only upon distances.
In the motions of the stars, planets, gas particles, the human mind of the nineteenth century saw the manifestation of the same mechanical view.
It understood the world of sensual impressions by forming pictures of particles and assuming simple forces acting among them.
The philosophy of nature from the beginning of physics to the nineteenth century is based upon the belief that to understand phenomena means to use in their explanation the concepts of particles and forces which depend only upon distances.


To understand means always to reduce the complicated to the simple and familiar.
For the physicists of the nineteenth century, to explain meant to form a mechanical picture from which the phenomena could be deduced.
The physicists of the past century believed that it is possible to form a mechanical picture of the universe, that the whole universe is in this sense a great and complicated mechanical system.


Through slow, painful struggle and progress the mechanical view broke down.
It became apparent that the simple concepts of particles and forces are not sufficient to explain all phenomena of nature.
As so often happens in physics, in the time of need and doubt, a great new idea was born: that of the <em>field</em>.
The old theory states: particles and the forces between them are the basic concepts.
The new theory states: changes in space, spreading in time through all of space, are the basic concepts of our descriptions.
These basic changes characterize the <em>field</em>.


Electrical phenomena were the birthplace of the field concept.
The very words used in talking about radio waves&mdash;<em>sent, spread, received</em>&mdash;imply changes in space and therefore <em>field</em>.
Not particles in certain points of space, but the whole continuous space forms the scenery of events which change with time.


The transition from particle physics to field physics is undoubtedly one of the greatest, and, as Einstein believes, <em>the</em> greatest step accomplished in the history of human thought.
Great courage and imagination were needed to shift the responsibility for physical phenomena from particles into the previously empty space and to formulate mathematical equations describing the changes in space and time.
This great change in the history of physics proved extremely fruitful in the theory of electricity and magnetism. In fact this change is mostly responsible for the great technical development in modern times.


We now know for sure that the old mechanical concepts are insufficient for the description of physical phenomena.
But are the field concepts sufficient? Perhaps there is a still more primitive question: I see an object; how can I understand its existence.
From the point of view of a mechanical theory the answer would be obvious: the object consists of small particles held together by forces.
But we can look upon an object as upon a portion of space where the field is very intense or, as we say, where the energy is especially dense.
The mechanist says: here is the object localized at this point of space.
The field physicist says: field is everywhere, but it diminishes outside this portion so rapidly that my senses are aware of it only in this particular portion of space.


Basically, three views are possible:

1. The mechanistic: to reduce everything to particles and forces acting among them, depending only on distances.

2. The field view: to reduce everything to field concepts concerning continuous changes in time and space.

3. The dualistic view: to assume the existence of both matter and field.

For the present these three cases exhaust the possibiUties of a philosophical approach to basic physical problems.
The past generation believed in the first possibility.
None of the present generation of physicists believes in it any more.
Nearly all physicists accept, for the present, the third view, assuming the existence of both matter and field.


But the feeling of beauty and simplicity is essential to all scientific creation and forms the vista of future theories; where does the development of science lead?
Is not the mixture of field and matter something temporary, accepted only out of necessity because we have not yet succeeded in forming a consistent picture based on the field concepts alone?
Is it possible to form a pure field theory and to create what appears as matter out of the field?


These are the basic problems, and Einstein is and always has been interested in basic problems.
He said to me once:

&ldquo;I am really more of a philosopher than a physicist.&rdquo;

There is nothing strange in this remark.
Every physicist is a philosopher as well, although it is possible to be a good experimentalist and a bad philosopher.
But if one takes physics seriously, one can hardly avoid coming in contact with the fundamental philosophic questions.


General relativity theory (so called in contrast to special relativity theory, developed earlier by Einstein) attacks the problem of gravitation for the first time since Newton.
Newton's theory of gravitation fits the old mechanical view perfectly.  We could say more.
It was the success of Newton's theory that caused the mechanical view to spread over all of physics.
But with the triumphs of the field theory of physics a new task appeared: to fit the gravitational problem into the new field frame.

This is the work which was done by Einstein.
Formulating the equations for the gravitational field, he did for gravitational theory what Faraday and Maxwell did for the theory of electricity.
This is of course only one aspect of the theory of relativity and perhaps not the most important one, but it is a part of the principal problems on which Einstein has worked for the last few years and on which he is still working.


Einstein finished his introductory remarks and told me why he did not like the way the problem of a unitary field theory had been attacked by Born and me.
Then he told me of his unsuccessful attempts to understand matter as a concentration of the field, then about his theory of &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; and the difficulties which he and his collaborator had encountered while developing that theory during a whole year of tedious work.


At this moment a knock at the door interrupted our conversation.
A very small, thin man of about sixty entered, smiling and gesticulating, apologizing vividly with his hands, undecided in what language to speak.
It was Levi-Civita, the famous Italian mathematician, at that time a professor in Rome and invited to Princeton for half a year.
This small, frail man had refused some years before to swear the fascist oath designed for university professors in Italy.


Einstein had known Levi-Civita for a long time.
But the form in which he greeted his old friend for the first time in Princeton was very similar to the way he had greeted me.
By gestures rather than words Levi-Civita indicated that he did not want to disturb us, showing with both his hands at the door that he could go away.
To emphasize the idea he bent his small body in this direction.

It was my turn to protest:

&ldquo;I can easily go away and come some other time.&rdquo;

Then Einstein protested:

&ldquo;No. We can all talk together.
I shall repeat briefly what I said to Infeld just now.
We did not go very far.
And then we can discuss the later part.&rdquo;

We all agreed readily, and Einstein began to repeat his introductory remarks more briefly.
This time &ldquo;English&rdquo; was chosen as the language of our conversation.
Since I had heard the first part before, I did not need to be very attentive and could enjoy the show. I could not help laughing.
Einstein's English was very simple, containing about three hundred words pronounced in a peculiar way.
He had picked it up without having learned the language formally.
But every word was understandable because of his quietness, slow tempo and the distinct, attractive sound of his voice.
Levi-Civita's English was much worse, and the sense of his words melted in the Italian pronunciation and vivid gestures.
Understanding was possible between us only because mathematicians hardly need words to understand each other.
They have their symbols and a few technical terms which are recomizable even when deformed.


I watched the calm, impressive Einstein and the small, thin, broadly gesticulating Levi-Civita as they pointed out formulae on the blackboard and talked in a language which they thought to be English.
The picture they made, and the sight of Einstein pulling up his baggy trousers every few seconds, was a scene, impressive and at the same time comic, which I shall never forget.
I tried to restrain myself from laughing by saying to myself:


&ldquo;Here you are talking and discussing physics with the most famous scientist in the world and you want to laugh because he does not wear suspenders!&rdquo;
The persuasion worked and I managed to control myself just as Einstein began to talk about his latest, still unpublished paper concerning the work done during the preceding year with his assistant Rosen.


It was on the problem of gravitational waves.
Again I believe that, in spite of the highly technical, mathematical character of this work, it is possible to explain the basic ideas in simple words.

The existence of electromagnetic waves, for example, light waves, X rays or wireless waves, can be explained by one theory embracing all these and many other phenomena: by Maxwell's equations governing the electromagnetic field.
The prediction that electromagnetic waves Tnust exist was prior to Hertz's experiment showing that the waves do exist.


General relativity is a field theory and, roughly speaking, it does for the problem of gravitation what Maxwell's theory did for the problem of electromagnetic phenomena.
It is therefore apparent that the existence of gravitational waves can be deduced from general relativity just as the existence of electromagnetic waves can be deduced from Maxwell's theory.
Every physicist who has ever studied the theory of relativity is convinced on this point.
In their motion the stars send out gravitational waves, spreading in time through space, just as oscillating electrons send out electromagnetic waves.
It is a common feature of all field theories that the influence of one object on another, of one electron or star on another electron or star, spreads through space with a great but finite velocity in the form of waves.
A superficial mathematical investigation of the structure of gravitational equations showed the existence of gravitational waves, and it was always believed that a more thorough examination could only confirm this result, giving some finer features of the gravitational waves.
No one cared about a deeper investigation of this subject because in nature gravitational waves, or gravitational radiation, seem to play a very small role.
It is different in Maxwell's theory, where the electromagnetic radiation is essential to the description of natural phenomena.


So everyone believed in gravitational waves.
In the previous two years Einstein had begun to doubt their existence.
If we investigate the problem superficially, they seem to exist.
But Einstein claimed that a deeper analysis flatly contradicts the previous statement.
This result, if true, would be of a fundamental nature.
It would reveal something which would astound every physicist: that field theory and the existence of waves are not as closely connected as previously thought.
It would show us once more that the first intuition may be wrong, that deeper mathematical analysis may give us new and unexpected results quite different from those foreseen when only scratching the surface of gravitational equations.


I was very much interested in this result, though somewhat skeptical.
During my scientific career I had learned that you may admire someone and regard him as the greatest scientist in the world but you must trust your own brain still more.
Scientific creation would become sterile if results were authoritatively or dogmatically accepted. Everyone has his own intuition.
Everyone has his fairly rigidly determined level of achievement and is capable only of small up-and-down oscillations around it.
To know this level, to know one's place in the scientific world, is essential.
It is good to be master in the restricted world of your own possibilities and to outgrow the habit of accepting results before they have been thoroughly tested by your mind.


Both Levi-Civita and I were impressed by the conclusion regarding the nonexistence of gravitational waves, although there was no time to develop the technical methods which led to this conclusion.
Levi-Civita indicated that he had a luncheon appointment by gestures so vivid that they made me feel hungry.
Einstein asked me to accompany him home, where he would give me the manuscript of his paper. On the way we talked physics.
This overdose of science began to weary me and I had difficulty in following him. Einstein talked on a subject to which we returned in our conversations many times later.
He explained why he did not find the modern quantum mechanics aesthetically satisfactory and why he believed in its provisional character which would be changed fundamentally by future development.


He took me to his study with its great window overlooking the bright autumn colors of his lovely garden, and his first and only remark which did not concern physics was:

&ldquo;There is a beautiful view from this window.&rdquo;

Excited and happy, I went home with the manuscript of Einstein's paper.
I felt the anticipation of intense emotions which always accompany scientific work: the sleepless nights in which imagination is most vivid and the controlling criticism weakest, the ecstasy of seeing the light, the despair when a long and tedious road leads nowhere; the attractive mixture of happiness and unhappiness.
All this was before me, raised to the highest level because I was working in the best place in the world.

<span class"textsc">The progress of my work</span> with Einstcin brought an increasing intimacy between us.
More and more often we talked of social problems, politics, human relations, science, philosophy, life and death, fame and happiness and, above all, about the future of science and its ultimate aims.
Slowly I came to know Einstein better and better.
I could foresee his reactions; I understood his attitude which, although strange and unusual, was always fully consistent with the essential features of his personality.

Seldom has anyone met as many people in his life as Einstein has.
Kings and presidents have entertained him; everyone is eager to meet him and to secure his friendship.
It is comparatively easy to meet Einstein but difficult to know him.
His mail brings him letters from all over the world which he tries to answer as long as there is any sense in answering.
But through all the stream of events, the impact of people and social life forced upon him, Einstein remains lonely, loving solitude, isolation and conditions which secure undisturbed work.


A few years ago, in London, Einstein made a speech in Albert Hall on behalf of the refugee scientists, the first of whom had begun to pour out from Germany all over the world.
Einstein said then that there are many positions, besides those in universities, which would be suitable for scientists.
As an example he mentioned a lighthouse keeper.
This would be comparatively easy work which would allow one to contemplate and to do scientific research. His remark seemed funny to every scientist.
But it is quite understandable from Einstein's point of view.
One of the consequences of loneliness is to judge everything by one's own standards, to be unable to change one's co-ordinate systern by putting oneself into someone else's being.
I always noticed this difficulty in Einstein's reactions.
For him loneliness, life in a lighthouse, would be most stimulating, would free him from so many of the duties which he hates.
In fact it would be for him the ideal life. But nearly every scientist thinks just the opposite.
It was the curse of my life that for a long time I was not in a scientific atmosphere, that I had no one with whom to talk physics.
It is commonly known that stimulating environment strongly influences the scientist, that he may do good work in a scientific atmosphere and that he may become sterile, his ideas dry up and all his research activity die if his environment is scientifically dead.
I knew that put back in a gymnasium, in a provincial Polish town, I should not publish anything, and the same would have happened to many another scientist better than I.
But genius is an exception. Einstein could work anywhere, and it is difficult to convince him that he is an exception.


He regards himself as extremely lucky in life because he never had to fight for his daily bread.
He enjoyed the years spent in the patent office in Switzerland.
He found the atmosphere more friendly, more human, less marred by intrigue than at the universities, and he had plenty of time for scientific work.


In connection with the refugee problem he told me that he would not have minded working with his hands for his daily bread, doing something useful like making shoes and treating physics only as a hobby; that this might be more attractive than earning money from physics by teaching at the university.
Again something deeper is hidden behind this attitude.
It is the &ldquo;religious&rdquo; feeling, bound up with scientific work, recalling that of the early Christian ascetics.
Physics is great and important.
It is not quite right to earn money by physics.
Better to do something different for a living, such as tending a lighthouse or making shoes, and keep physics aloof and clean.
Naive as it may seem, this attitude is consistent with Einstein's character.

I learned much from Einstein in the realm of physics.
But what I value most is what I was taught by my contact with him in the human rather than the scientific domain.
Einstein is the kindest, most understanding and helpful man in the world.
But again this somewhat commonplace statement must not be taken literally.


The feeling of pity is one of the sources of human kindness.
Pity for the fate of our fellow men, for the misery around us, for the suffering of human beings, stirs our emotions by the resonance of sympathy.
Our own attachments to life and people, the ties which bind us to the outside world, awaken our emotional response to the struggle and suffering outside ourselves.
But there is also another entirely different source of human kindness.
It is the detached feeling of duty based on aloof, clear reasoning.
Good, clear thinking leads to kindness and loyalty because this is what makes life simpler, fuller, richer, diminishes friction and unhappiness in our environment and therefore also in our lives.
A sound social attitude, helpfulness, friendliness, kindness, may come from both these different sources; to express it anatomically, from heart and brain.
As the years passed I learned to value more and more the second kind of decency that arises from clear thinking.
Too often I have seen how emotions unsupported by clear thought are useless if not destructive.

Here again, as I see it, Einstein represents a limiting case.
I had never encountered so much kindness that was so completely detached.
Though only scientific ideas and physics really matter to Einstein, he has never refused to help when he felt that his help was needed and could be effective.
He wrote thousands of letters of recommendation, gave advice to hundreds.
For hours he talked with a crank because the family had written that Einstein was the only one who could cure him.
Einstein is kind, smiling, understanding, talkative with people whom he meets, waiting patiently for the moment when he will be left alone to return to his work.

Einstein wrote about himself:

<blockquote>
My passionate interest in social justice and social responsibility has always stood in curious contrast to a marked lack of desire for direct association with men and women.
I am a horse for single harness, not cut out for tandem or teamwork.
I have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or state, to my circle of friends or even to my own family.
These ties have always been accompanied by a vague aloofness, and the wish to withdraw into myself increases with the years.

Such isolation is sometimes bitter, but I do not regret being cut off from the understanding and sympathy of other men.
I lose something by it, to be sure, but I am compensated for it in being rendered independent of the customs, opinions and prejudices of others and am not tempted to rest my peace of mind upon such shifting foundations.
</blockquote>

For scarcely anyone is fame so undesired and meaningless as for Einstein.
It is not that he has learned the bitter taste of fame, as frequently happens, after having desired it.
Einstein told me that in his youth he had always wished to be isolated from the struggle of life. He was certainly the last man to have sought fame.
But fame came to him, perhaps the greatest a scientist has ever known. I often wondered why it came to Einstein.
His ideas have not influenced our practical life.
No electric light, no telephone, no wireless is connected with his name.
Perhaps the only important technical discovery which takes its origin in Einstein's theoretical work is that of the photoelectric cell.
But Einstein is certainly not famous because of this discovery.
It is his work on relativity theory which has made his name known to all the civilized world. Does the reason lie in the great influence of Einstein's theory upon philosophical thought?
This again cannot be the whole explanation.
The latest developments in quantum mechanics, its connection with determinism and indeterminism, influenced philosophical thought fully as much.
But the names of Bohr and Heisenberg have not the glory that is Einstein's.
The reasons for the great fame which diffused deeply among the masses of people, most of them removed from creative scientific work, incapable of estimating his work, must be manifold and, I believe, sociological in character.
The explanation was suggested to me by discussions with one of my friends in England.


It was in 1919 that Einstein's fame began.
At this time his great achievement, the structure of the special and general relativity theories, was essentially finished.
As a matter of fact it had been completed five years before.
One of the consequences of the general relativity theory may be described as follows: if we photograph a fragment of the heavens during a solar eclipse and the same fragment in normal conditions, we obtain slightly different pictures.
The gravitational field of the sun slightly disturbs and deforms the path of light, therefore the photographic picture of a fragment of the heavens will vary somewhat during the solar eclipse from that under normal conditions.
Not only qualitatively but quantitatively the theory of relativity predicted the difference in these two pictures.
English scientific expeditions sent in 19 19 to different parts of the world, to Africa and South America, confirmed this prediction made by Einstein.


Thus began Einstein's great fame.
Unlike that of film stars, politicians and boxers, the fame persists.
There are no signs of its diminishing; there is no hope of relief for Einstein.
The fact that the theory predicted an event which is as far from our everyday life as the stars to which it refers, an event which follows from a theory through a long chain of abstract arguments, seems hardly sufficient to raise the enthusiasm of the masses.
But it did.
And the reason must be looked for in the postwar psychology.

It was just after the end of the war.
People were weary of hatred, of killing and international intrigues.
The trenches, bombs and murder had left a bitter taste.
Books about war did not sell.
Everyone looked for a new era of peace and wanted to forget the war.
Here was something which captured the imagination: human eyes looking from an earth covered with graves and blood to the heavens covered with stars.
Abstract thought carrying the human mind far away from the sad and disappointing reality.
The mystery of the sun's eclipse and the penetrating power of the human mind.
Romantic scenery, a strange glimpse of the eclipsed sun, an imaginary picture of bending light rays, all removed from the oppressive reality of life.
One further reason, perhaps even more important: a new event was predicted by a <em>German</em> scientist Einstein and confirmed by <em>English</em> astronomers.
Scientists belonging to two warring nations had collaborated again!
It seemed the beginning of a new era.

It is difficult to resist fame and not to be influenced by it.
But fame has had no effect on Einstein.
And again the reason lies in his internal isolation, in his aloofness.
Fame bothers him when and as long as it impinges on his life, but he ceases to be conscious of it the moment he is left alone.
Einstein is unaware of his fame and forgets it when he is allowed to forget it.


Even in Princeton everyone looks with hungry, astonished eyes at Einstein.
During our walks we avoided the more crowded streets to walk through fields and along forgotten byways.
Once a car stopped us and a middle-aged woman got out with a camera and said, blushing and excited:

&ldquo;Professor Einstein, will you allow me to take a picture of you?&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yes, sure.&rdquo;

He stood quiet for a second, then continued his argument.
The scene did not exist for him, and I am sure after a few minutes he forgot that it had ever happened.


Once we went to a movie in Princeton to see the <em>Life of Emile Zola</em>.
After we had bought our tickets we went to a crowded waiting room and found that we should have to wait fifteen minutes longer.
Einstein suggested that we go for a walk.
When we went out I said to the doorman:

&ldquo;We shall return in a few minutes.&rdquo;

But Einstein became seriously concerned and added in all innocence:

&ldquo;We haven't our tickets any more. Will you recognize us?&rdquo;

The doorman thought we were joking and said, laughing:

&ldquo;Yes, Professor Einstein, I will.&rdquo;

Einstein is, if he is allowed to be, completely unaware of his fame, and he furnishes a unique example of a character untouched by the impact of the greatest fame and publicity.
But there are moments when the aggressiveness of the outside world disturbs his peace. He once told me:

&ldquo;I envy the simplest working man. He has his privacy.&rdquo;

Another time he remarked':

&ldquo;I appear to myself as a swindler because of the great publicity about me without any real reason.&rdquo;


Einstein understands everyone beautifully when logic and thinking are needed.
It is much less easy, however, where emotions are concerned; it is difficult for him to imagine motives and emotions other than those which are a part of his life.
Once he told me:

&ldquo;I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university.&rdquo;

I remarked that this is difficult for other people.
That, for example, when they meet him they feel shy and embarrassed, that it takes time for this feeling to disappear and that it was so in my case.
He said:

&ldquo;I cannot understand this. Why should anyone be shy with me?&rdquo;

If my explanation concerning the beginning of Einstein's fame is correct, then there still remains another question to be answered: why does this fame cling so persistently to Einstein in a changing world which scorns today its idols of yesterday?
I do not think the answer is difficult.

Everything that Einstein did, everything for which he stood, was always consistent with the primary picture of him in the minds of the people.
His voice was always raised in defense of the suppressed; his signature always appeared in defense of liberal causes.
He was like a saint with two halos around his head.
One was formed of ideas of justice and progress, the other of abstract ideas about physical theories which, the more abstruse they were, the more impressive they seemed to the ordinary man.
His name became a symbol of progress, humanity and creative thought, hated and despised by those who spread hate and who attack the ideas for which Einstein's name stands.


From the same source, from the desire to defend the oppressed, arose his interest in the Jewish problem.
Einstein himself was not reared in the Jewish tradition.
It is again his detached attitude of sympathy, the rational idea that help must be given where help is needed, that brought him near to the Jewish problem.
Jews have made splendid use of Einstein's gentle attitude.
He once said:


&ldquo;I am something of a Jewish saint.
When I die the Jews will take my bones to a banquet and collect money.&rdquo;

In spite of Einstein's detachment I had often the impression that the Jewish problem is nearer his heart than any other social problem.
The reason may be that I met him just at the time when the Jewish tragedy was greatest and perhaps, also, because he believes that there he can be most helpful.

Einstein also fully realized the importance of the war in Spain and foresaw that on its outcome not only Spain's fate but the future of the world depended.
I remember the gleam that came into his eyes when I told him that the afternoon papers carried news of a Loyalist victory.


&ldquo;That sounds like an angel's song,&rdquo; he said with an excitement which I had hardly ever noticed before.
But two minutes later we were writing down formulae and the external world had again ceased to exist.


It took me a long time to realize that in his aloofness and isolation lie the simple keys leading to an understanding of many of his actions.
I am quite sure that the day Einstein received the Nobel prize he was not in the slightest degree excited and that if he did not sleep well that it was because of a problem which was bothering him and not because of the scientific distinction.
His Nobel prize medal, together with many others, is laid aside among papers, honorary degrees and diplomas in the room where his secretary works, and I am sure that Einstein has no clear idea of what the medal looks like.


Einstein tries consciously to keep liis aloofness intact by small idiosyncrasies which may seem strange but which increase his freedom and further loosen his ties with the external world.
He never reads articles about himself. He said that this helps him to be free. Once I tried to break his habit.
In a French newspaper there was an article about Einstein which was reproduced in many European papers, even in Poland and Lithuania.
I have never seen an article which was further from the truth than this one.
For example, the author said that Einstein wears glasses, lives in Princeton in one room on the fifth floor, comes to the institute at 7&nbsp;<span class="textsc">a.m.</span>, always wears black, keeps many of his technical discoveries secret, etc.
The article could be characterized as the peak of stupidity if stupidity could be said to have a peak.
Fine Hall rejoiced in the article and hung it up as a curiosity on the bulletin board at the entrance.
I thought it so funny that I read it to Einstein, who at my request listened carefully but was little interested and refused to be amused.
I could see from his expression that he failed to understand why I found it so funny.


One of my colleagues in Princeton asked me: &ldquo;If Einstein dislikes his fame and would like to increase his privacy, why does he not do what ordinary people do?
Why does he wear long hair, a funny leather jacket, no socks, no suspenders, no collars, no ties?&rdquo;


The answer is simple and can easily be deduced from his aloofness and desire to loosen his ties with the outside world.
The idea is to restrict his needs and, by this restriction, increase his freedom.
We are slaves of millions of things, and our slavery progresses steadily.
For a week I tried an electric razor&mdash;and one more slavery entered my life.
I dreaded spending the summer where there was no electric current.
We are slaves of bathrooms, Frigidaires, cars, radios and millions of other things.
Einstein tried to reduce them to the absolute minimum.
Long hair minimizes the need for the barber.
Socks can be done without.
One leather jacket solves the coat problem for many years.
Suspenders are superfluous, as are nightshirts and pajamas.
It is a minimum problem which Einstein has solved, and shoes, trousers, shirt, jacket, are the very necessary things; it would be difficult to reduce them further.

I like to imagine Einstein's behavior in an unusual situation.
For example: Princeton is bombed from the air; explosives fall over the city, people flee to shelter, panic spreads over the town and everyone loses his head, increasing the chaos and fear by his behavior.
If this situation should find Einstein walking through the street, he would be the only man to remain as quiet as before.
He would think out what to do in this situation; he would do it without accelerating the normal speed of his motions and he would still keep in mind the problem on which he was thinking.
There is no fear of death in Einstein.
He said to me once: &ldquo;Life is an exciting show.
I enjoy it.
It is wonderful.
But if I knew that I should have to die in three hours it would impress me very little.
I should think how best to use the last three hours, then quietly order my papers and lie peacefully down.&rdquo;
