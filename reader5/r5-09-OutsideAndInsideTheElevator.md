The law of inertia marks the first great advance in physics; in fact, its real beginning. 
It was gained by the contemplation of an idealized experiment, a body moving forever with no friction nor any other external forces acting. 
From this example and later from many others, we recognized the importance of the idealized experiment created by thought. 
Here again, idealized experiments will be discussed. 
Although these may sound very fantastic they will, nevertheless, help us to understand as much about relativity as is possible by our simple methods. 

We had previously the idealized experiments with a uniformly moving room. 
Here, for a change, we shall have a falling elevator. 


Imagine a great elevator at the top of a skyscraper much higher than any real one. 
Suddenly the cable supporting the elevator breaks, and the elevator falls freely toward the ground. 
Observers in the elevator are performing experiments during the fall. 
In describing them, we need not bother about air resistance or friction, for we may disregard their existence under our idealized conditions. 
One of the observers takes a handkerchief and a watch from his pocket and drops them. 
What happens to these two bodies? 
For the outside observer, who is looking through the window of the elevator, both handkerchief and watch fall toward the ground in exactly the same way, with the same acceleration. 
We remember that the acceleration of a falling body is quite independent of its mass and that it was this fact which revealed the equaUty of gravitational and inertial mass (p. 37). 
We also remember that the equality of the two masses, gravitational and inertial, was quite accidental from the point of view of classical mechanics and played no role in its structure. 
Here, however, this equality reflected in the equal acceleration of all falling bodies is essential and forms the basis of our whole argument. 


Let us return to our falling handkerchief and watch; for the outside observer they are both falling with the same acceleration. 
But so is the elevator, with its walls, ceiling, and floor. 
Therefore: the distance between the two bodies and the floor will not change. 
For the inside observer the two bodies remain exactly where they were when he let them go. 
The inside observer may ignore the gravitational field, since its source lies outside his CS. 
He finds that no forces inside the elevator act upon the two bodies, and so they are at rest, just as if they were in an inertial CS. 
Strange things happen in the elevator! 
If the observer pushes a body in any direction, up or down for instance, it always moves uniformly so long as it does not collide with the ceiling or the floor of the elevator. 
Briefly speaking, the laws of classical mechanics are valid for the observer inside the elevator. 
All bodies behave in the way expected by the law of inertia. 
Our new CS rigidly connected with the freely falling elevator differs from the inertial CS in only one respect. 
In an inerrial CS, a moving body on which no forces are acting will move uniformly forever. 
The inertial CS as represented in classical physics is neither hmited in space nor time. 
The case of the observer in our elevator is, however, different. 
The inertial character of his CS is limited in space and time. 
Sooner or later the uniformly moving body will collide with the wall of the elevator, destroying the uniform motion. 
Sooner or later the whole elevator will collide with the earth destroying the observers and their experiments. 
The CS is only a &ldquo;pocket edition&rdquo; of a real inertial CS. 


This local character of the CS is quite essential. 
If our imaginary elevator were to reach from the North Pole to the Equator, with the handkerchief placed over the North Pole and the watch over the Equator, then, for the outside observer, the two bodies would not have the same acceleration; they would not be at rest relative to each other. 
Our whole argument would fail! The dimensions of the elevator must be limited so that the equality of acceleration of all bodies relative to the outside observer may be assumed. 


With this restriction, the CS takes on an inertial character for the inside observer.
We can at least indicate a CS in which all the physical laws are valid, even though it is limited in time and space. 
If we imagine another CS, another elevator moving uniformly, relative to the one falling freely, then both these CS will be locally inertial. 
All laws are exactly the same in both. 
The transition from one to the other is given by the Lorentz transformation. 


Let us see in what way both the observers, outside and inside, describe what takes place in the elevator. 


The outside observer notices the motion of the elevator and of all bodies in the elevator, and finds them in agreement with Newton&#39;s gravitational law. 
For him, the motion is not uniform, but accelerated, because of the action of the gravitational field of the earth. 


However, a generation of physicists bom and brought up in the elevator would reason quite differently.
They would believe themselves in possession of an inertial system and would refer all laws of nature to their elevator, stating with justification that the laws take on a specially simple form in their CS. 
It would be natural for them to assume their elevator at rest and their CS the inertial one. 


It is impossible to settle the differences between the outside and the inside observers. 
Each of them could claim the right to refer all events to his CS. 
Both descriptions of events could be made equally consistent. 


We see from this example that a consistent description of physical phenomena in two different CS is possible, even if they are not moving uniformly, relative to each other. 
But for such a description we must take into account gravitation, building so to speak, the &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; which effects a transition from one CS to the other. 
The gravitational field exists for the outside observer; it does not for the inside observer. 
Accelerated motion of the elevator in the gravitational field exists for the outside observer, rest and absence of the gravitational field for the inside observer. 
But the &ldquo;bridge,&rdquo; the gravitational field, making the description in both CS possible, rests on one very important pillar: the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass. 
Without this clew, unnoticed in classical mechanics, our present argument would fail completely. 


Now for a somewhat different idealized experiment. 
There is, let us assume, an inertial CS, in which the law of inertia is valid. 
We have already described what happens in an elevator resting in such an inertial CS. 
But we now change our picture. 
Someone outside has fastened a rope to the elevator and is pulling, with a constant force, in the direction indicated in our drawing. 
It is immaterial how this is done. 
Since the laws of mechanics are valid in this CS, the whole elevator moves with a constant acceleration in the direction of the motion. 
Again we shall listen to the explanation of phenomena going on in the elevator and given by both the outside and inside observers. \

<em>The outside observer</em>: My CS is an inertial one. 
The elevator moves with constant acceleration, because a constant force is acting. 
The observers inside are in absolute motion, for them the laws of mechanics are invalid. 
They do not find that bodies, on which no forces are acting, are at rest. 
If a body is left free, it soon collides with the floor of the elevator, since the floor moves upward toward the body. 
This happens exactly in the same way for a watch and for a handkerchief. 
It seems very strange to me that the observer inside the elevator must always be on the &ldquo;floor&rdquo; because as soon as he jumps, the floor will reach him again. 


<em>The inside observer</em>: I do not see any reason for believing that my elevator is in absolute motion. 
I agree that my CS, rigidly connected with my elevator, is not really inertial, but I do not believe that it has anything to do with absolute motion. 
My watch, my handkerchief, and all bodies arc falling because the whole elevator is in a gravitational field. 
I notice exactly the same kinds of motion as the man on the earth. 
He explains them very simply by the action of a gravitational field. 
The same holds good for me. 


These two descriptions, one by the outside, the other by the inside, observer, are quite consistent, and there is no possibility of deciding which of them is right. 
We may assume either one of them for the description of phenomena in the elevator: either nonuniform motion and absence of a gravitational field with the outside observer, or rest and the presence of a gravitational field with the inside observer. 


The outside observer may assume that the elevator is in &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; nonuniform motion. 
But a motion which is wiped out by the assumption of an acting gravitational field cannot be regarded as absolute motion. 


There is, possibly, a way out of the ambiguity of two such different descriptions, and a decision in favor of one against the other could perhaps be made. 
Imagine that a light ray enters the elevator horizontally through a side window and reaches the opposite wall after a very short time. 
Again let us see how the path of the light would be predicted by the two observers. 


<em>The outside observer</em>, believing in accelerated motion of the elevator, would argue: The light ray enters the window and moves horizontally, along a straight line and with a constant velocity, toward the opposite wall.
But the elevator moves upward and during the time in which the light travels toward the wall, the elevator changes its position. 
Therefore, the ray will meet a point not exactly opposite its point of entrance, but a little below. 
The difference will be very slight, but it exists nevertheless, and the light ray travels, relative to the elevator, not along a straight, but along a slightly curved Hne. 
The difference is due to the distance covered by the elevator during the time the ray is crossing the interior.

<em>The inside observer</em>, who believes in the gravitational field acting on all objects in his elevator, would say: there is no accelerated motion of the elevator, but only the action of the gravitational field. 
A beam of light is weightless and, therefore, will not be affected by the gravitational field. 
If sent in a horizontal direction, it will meet the wall at a point exactly opposite to that at which it entered. 


It seems from this discussion that there is a possibility of deciding between these two opposite points of view as the phenomenon would be different for the two observers. 
If there is nothing illogical in either of the explanations just quoted, then our whole previous argument is destroyed, and we cannot describe all phenomena in two consistent ways, with and without a gravitational field. 


But there is, fortunately, a grave fault in the reasoning of the inside observer, which saves our previous conclusion. 
He said: &ldquo;A beam of light is weightless and, therefore, it will not be affected by the gravitational field.&rdquo; 
This cannot be right! 
A beam of light carries energy and energy has mass. 
But every inertial mass is attracted by the gravitational field as inertial and gravitational masses are equivalent. 
A beam of light will bend in a gravitational field exactly as a body would if thrown horizontally with a velocity equal to that of light. 
If the inside observer had reasoned correctly and had taken into account the bending of light rays in a gravitational field, then his results would have been exactly the same as those of an outside observer. 


The gravitational field of the earth is, of course, too weak for the bending of light rays in it to be proved directly, by experiment. 
But the famous experiments performed during the solar eclipses show, conclusively though indirectly, the influence of a gravitational field on the path of a light ray. 


It follows from these examples that there is a wellfounded hope of formulating a relativistic physics. 
But for this we must first tackle the problem of gravitation. 

We saw from the example of the elevator the consistency of the two descriptions. 
Nonuniform motion may, or may not, be assumed. 
We can eliminate &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; motion from our examples by a gravitational field.  
But then there is nothing absolute in the nonuniform motion. 
The gravitational field is able to wipe it out completely. 


The ghosts of absolute motion and inertial CS can be expelled from physics and a new relativistic physics built. 
Our idealized experiments show how the problem of the general relativity theory is closely connected with that of gravitation and why the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass is so essential for this connection. 
It is clear that the solution of the gravitational problem in the general theory of relativity must differ from the Newtonian one. 
The laws of gravitation must, just as all laws of nature, be formulated for all possible CS, whereas the laws of classical mechanics, as formulated by Newton, are valid only in inertial CS.
