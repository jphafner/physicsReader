## The Clock Paradox in Relativity

In the course of reasoning on this subject with some of my more recalcitrant friends, I have come across a numerical example which I think makes the matter easier to follow than would any mathematical formulae, and perhaps this might interest some readers of Nature.


There is no doubt whatever that the accepted theory of relativity is a complete and self-consistent theory (at any rate up to a range of knowledge far beyond the present matter), and it quite definitely implies that a space-traveller will return from his journey younger than his stay-at-home twin brother.
We all of us have an instinctive resistance against this idea, but it has got to be accepted as an essential part of the theory.
If Prof. H. Dingle should be correct in his disagreement, it would destroy the whole of relativity theory as it stands at present.


Some have found a further difficulty in understanding the matter. When two bodies are moving away from each other, each sees the occurrences on the other slowed down according to the Doppler effect, and relativity requires that they should both appear to be slowed down to exactly the same degree.
Thus if there are clock-dials on each body visible from the other, both will appear to be losing time at the same rate.
Conversely, the clocks will appear to be gaining equally as they approach one another again.
At first sight this might seem to suggest that there is an exact symmetry between the two bodies, so that the clock of neither ought in the end to record a time behind that of the other.
The present example will show how this argument fails.


In order to see how a time-difference will arise, it suffices to take the case of special relativity without complications from gravitation.
Two space-ships, <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span>, and <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>, are floating together in free space.
By firing a rocket <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>, goes off to a distant star, and on arrival there he fires a stronger rocket so as to reverse his motion, and finally by means of a third rocket he checks his speed so as to come to rest alongside <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span>, who has stayed quietly at home all the time.
Then they compare their experiences.
The reunion of the two ships is an essential of the proceedings, because it is only through it that the well-known difficulties about time-in-other-places are avoided.


The work is to be so arranged that it can be done by ordinary ships&#39; navigators, and does not require the presence in the crews of anyone cognizant of the mysteries of time-in-other-places.
To achieve this, I suppose that the two ships are equipped with identical caesium clocks, which are geared so as to strike the hours.
On the stroke of every hour each ship sends out a flash of light.
These flashes are seen by the other ship and counted, and they are logged against the hour strokes of its own clock.
Finally the two logs will be compared.


In the first place it must be noted that <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>&#39;s clock may behave irregularly during the short times of his three accelerations.
This trouble can be avoided by instructing him to switch the clock off before firing his rockets, and only to start it again when he has got up to a uniform speed, which he can recognize from the fact that he will no longer be pressed against one wall of his ship.
The total of his time will be affected by this error, but it will be to the same extent whether he is going to the Andromeda Nebula, or merely to Mars.
Since the time that is the subject under dispute is proportional to the total time of his absence, this direct effect of acceleration can be disregarded.


I choose as the velocity of <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>&#39;s travel <span class="math">v=&#8536;<!--vulgar 4/5-->c</span>, because in this special case there are no tiresome irrationalities to consider.
I take the star to be 4 light-years away from <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span>.
    The journey there and back will therefore take 10 years according to <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span>.
Immediately after the start each will observe the other&#39;s flashes slowed down by the Doppler effect.
The formula for this in relativity theory is <span class="math">&radic;((c+v)/(c-v))</span>, which in the present case gives exactly 3.
That is to say, each navigator will log the other&#39;s flashes at a rate of one every three hours of his own clock&#39;s time.
Conversely, when they are nearing one another again, each will log the other&#39;s flashes at a rate of three an hour.


So far everything is perfectly symmetrical between the ships, but the question arises, for each ship respectively, how soon the slow flashes will change over into fast ones.
First take the case of <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>.
During his outward journey he will get slow flashes, but when he reverses direction at the star, they will suddenly change to fast ones.
Whatever his clock shows at this time it is certainly just half what it will show when he gets home.
Thus for half the journey he will get flashes at the rate of i per hour, and for the other half at a rate of 3 per hour.
The average for the whole journey will thus be at a rate (1/2)((1/3)+3)=5/3 per hour.
During this time <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span> will have sent out 10 years&#39; worth of flashes, and so in the end <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>&#39;s clock will record &#8535;&times;10=6 years, which, of course, he can verify directly from his detailed log.


<span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span>&#39;s log will be quite different.
He will start with slow flashes and end with fast ones, but the changeover is determined by <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>&#39;s reversal, which is occurring 4 light years away from him.
Consequently, he will get slow flashes for 5+4=9 years, and therefore fast flashes for only 1 year.
The total number he will count is &#8531; &times; 9 + &times; 1 = 6 years&#39; worth.
His nine years of slow flashes and one of fast are in marked contrast with <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>&#39;s experience of three years of each.
Thus when the navigators compare their logs together they will be completely different, but both will agree that <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span>&#39;s clock went for ten years and <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span>&#39;s for only six.


It may be that Sq will suggest that for some reason <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span>&#39;s clock was going slow during the motion, but <span class="math">S<sub>1</sub></span> will point out that there was no sign of anything wrong with it, and that anyhow his heart-beat and other bodily functions matched the rate of his clock and he may even direct attention to the fact that his forehead is perceptibly less wrinkled than that of his twin brother.
In fact&mdash;as the relativist knows&mdash;he is now actually four years younger than his brother.


In giving this example, I have assumed <span class="math">S<sub>0</sub></span> at rest for the sake of simplicity, but it is not hard to verify that the two logs will be exactly the same if a uniform motion of any amount is superposed on the system.
However, to show this would go beyond the scope of this communication.
