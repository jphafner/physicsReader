There is a parlor game often played by my colleagues in physics. 
It consists of trying to decide whether the physicists of the extraordinary generation that produced the modem quantum theory, in the late twenties, were intrinsically more gifted than our present generation or whether they simply had the good fortune to be at the height of their creative powers (for physicists, with some notable exceptions, this lies between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five at a time when there was a state of acute and total crisis in physics&emdash;a crisis brought about by the fact that existing physics simply did not account for what was known about the atom. 
In brief, if our generation had been alive at that time, could we have invented the quantum theory? 


It is a question that will never be answered. 
But there is no doubt that the group of men who did invent the theory was absolutely remarkable. 
Aside from Max Planck and Einstein (it was Planck who invented the notion of the quantum&emdash;the idea that energy was always emitted and absorbed in distinct units, or quanta, and not continuously, like water flowing from a tap&emdash;and it was Einstein who pointed out how Planck&#39;s idea could be extended and used to explain a variety of mysteries about matter and radiation that physicists were contending with), who did their important work before 1925, the list includes Niels Bohr, who conceived the
theory that the orbits of electrons around atoms were quantized (electrons, according to the Bohr theory, can move only in special elliptical paths&emdash;&ldquo;Bohr orbits&rdquo;&emdash;around the nucleus and not in any path, as the older physics would have predicted);
    Prince Louis de Broglie, a French aristocrat who conjectured in his doctoral thesis that both light and matter had particle and wave aspects;
    Werner Heisenberg, who made the first breakthrough that led to the mathematical formulation of the quantum theory, from which the Bohr orbits can be derived, and whose &ldquo;uncertainty relations&rdquo; set the limitations on measurements of atomic systems;
    P. A. M. Dirac, who made basic contributions to the mathematics of the theory and who showed how it could be reconciled with Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity;
    Wolfgang Pauli, whose &ldquo;exclusion principle&rdquo; led to an explanation of why there is a periodic table of chemical elements;
    Max Born and Pascual Jordan, who contributed to the interpretation of the theory;
    and, finally, Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger, whose Schr&ouml;dinger Equation is in many ways the basic equation of the quantum theory, and is to the new physics what Newton&#39;s laws of motion were to the physics that went before it. 


While Heisenberg, Pauli, and Dirac were all in their early twenties when they did their work, de Broglie and Bohr were older, as was Schr&ouml;dinger, who was born in Vienna in 1887. 
In 1926, he published the paper in which his equation was formulated. 
Oddly, just a few years before, he had decided to give up physics altogether for philosophy. 
Philipp Frank, who had been a classmate of Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s in Vienna, once told me that just before Schr&ouml;dinger began his work on the quantum theory he had been working on a psychological theory of color perception. 
Schr&ouml;dinger himself writes in the preface of his last book. 
<em>My View of the World</em> (Cambridge), published posthumously (he died in 1961), &ldquo;In 1918, when I was thirty-one, I had good reason to expect a chair of theoretical physics at Czernowitz.
&hellip; I was prepared to do a good job lecturing on theoretical physics &hellip; but for the rest, to devote myself to philosophy, being deeply imbued at the time with the writings of Spinoza, Schopenhauer, Ernst Mach, Richard Semon, and Richard Avenarius. My guardian angel intervened: Czernowitz soon no longer belonged to Austria. 
So nothing came of it. 
I had to stick to theoretical physics, and, to my astonishment, something occasionally emerged from it.&rdquo; 


The early quantum theoreticians were a small group, mainly Europeans, who knew each other well. 
There was among them a sense of collaborating on one of the most important discoveries in the history of physics. 
In his <em>Science and the Common Understanding</em>, Robert Oppenheimer wrote, &ldquo;Our understanding of atomic physics, of what we call the quantum theory of atomic systems, had its origins at the turn of the century and its great synthesis and resolutions in the nineteen-twenties. 
It was a heroic time. 
It was not the doing of any one man; it involved the collaboration of scores of scientists from many different lands, though from first to last the deeply creative and subtle and critical spirit of Niels Bohr guided, restrained, deepened, and finally transmuted the enterprise. 
It was a period of patient work in the laboratory, of crucial experiments and daring action, of many false starts and many untenable conjectures. 
It was a time of earnest correspondence and hurried conjectures, of debate, criticism, and brilliant mathematical improvisation. 
For those who participated, it was a time of creation; there was terror as well as exaltation in their new insight. 
It will probably not be recorded very completely as history. 
As history, its recreation would call for an art as high as the story of Oedipus or the story of Cromwell, yet in a realm of action so remote from our common experience that it is unlikely to be known to any poet or any historian.&rdquo; 


However, as the outlines of the theory became clearer, a sharp division of opinion arose as to the ultimate significance of it. 
Indeed, de Broglie, Einstein, and Schr&ouml;dinger came to feel that even though the theory illuminated vast stretches of physics and chemistry (&ldquo;All of chemistry and most of physics,&rdquo; Dirac wrote), there was fundamentally something unsatisfactory about it. 
The basic problem that troubled them was that the theory abandons causation of the kind that had been the goal of the classical physics of Newton and his successors: In the quantum theory, one cannot ask what one single electron in a single atom will do at a given time; the theory only describes the most probable behavior of an electron in a large collection of electrons. 
The theory is fundamentally statistical and deals solely with probabilities. 
The Schr&ouml;dinger Equation enables one to work out the mathematical expressions for these probabilities and to determine how the probabilities will change in time, but according to the accepted interpretation it does not provide a step-by-step description of the motion of, say, a single electron in an atom, in the way that Newtonian mechanics projects the trajectory of a planet moving around the sun. 


To most physicists, these limitations are a fundamental limitation, in principle, on the type of information that can be gathered by carrying out measurements of atomic systems. 
These limitations, which were first analyzed by Heisenberg and Bohr, are summarized in the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, which state, generally speaking, that the very process of making most measurements of an atomic system disturbs the system&#39;s behavior so greatly that it is put into a state qualitatively different from the one it was in before the measurement. 
(For example, to measure the position of an electron in an atom, one must illuminate the electron with light of very short wave length. 
This light carries so much momentum that the process of illuminating the electron knocks it clear out of the atom, so a second measurement of the position of the electron in the atom is impossible. 
&ldquo;We murder to dissect,&rdquo; as Wordsworth has said.) The observer&emdash;or, really, his measuring apparatus&emdash;has an essential influence on the observed. 
The physicists who have objected to the quantum theory feel that this limitation indicates the incompleteness of the theory and that there must exist a deeper explanation that would yield the same universal agreement with experiment that the quantum theory does but that would allow a completely deterministic description of atomic events. 
Naturally, the burden of finding such a theory rests upon those who feel that it must exist; so far, despite the repeated efforts of people like de Broglie, Einstein, and Schr&ouml;dinger, no such theory has been forthcoming. 


Schr&ouml;dinger, who was a brilliant writer of both scientific texts and popular scientific essays, summarized his distaste for the quantum theory in an essay entitled <em>Are There Quantum Jumps?</em> published in 1952: &ldquo;I have been trying to produce a mood that makes one wonder what parts of contemporary science will still be of interest to more than historians two thousand years hence. 
There have been ingenious constructs of the human mind that gave an exceedingly accurate description of observed facts and have yet lost all interest except to historians. 
I am thinking of the theory of epicycles. 
[This theory was used, especially by the Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy, to account for the extremely complicated planetary motions that had been observed; it postulated that they were compounded of innumerable simple circular motions. 
Reduced to the simplest terms, a planet was presumed to move in a small circle around a point that moved in a large circle around the earth. 
The theory was replaced by the assumption, conceived by Copernicus and Kepler, that the planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun.] 
I confess to the heretical view that their modern counterpart in physical theory are the quantum jumps.&rdquo; 
In his introduction to <em>My View of the World</em>, Schr&ouml;dinger puts his belief even more strongly: &ldquo;There is one complaint which I shall not escape. 
Not a word is said here of acausality, wave mechanics, indeterminacy relations, complementarity, an expanding universe, continuous creation, etc. 
Why doesn&#39;t he talk about what he knows instead of trespassing on the professional philosopher&#39;s preserves? 
<em>Ne sutor supra crepidam</em>. 
On this I can cheerfully justify myself: because I do not think that these things have as much connection as is currently supposed with a philosophical view of the world.&rdquo; 
There is a story that after Schr&ouml;dinger lectured, in the twenties, at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, in Copenhagen, in which Bohr was teaching, on the implications of his equation, a vigorous debate took place, in the course of which Schr&ouml;dinger remarked that if he had known that the whole thing would be taken so seriously he never would have invented it in the first place. 


Schr&ouml;dinger was too great a scientist not to recognize the significance of the all but universal success of the quantum theory&emdash;it accounts not only for &ldquo;all of chemistry and most of physics&rdquo; but even for astronomy; it can be used, for example, to make very precise computations of the energy generated in the nuclear reactions that go on in the sun and other stars. 
Indeed, Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s popular masterpiece. 
<em>What Is Life?</em> deals with the impact of quantum ideas on biology and above all on the molecular processes that underlie the laws of heredity. 
The two striking features of the hereditary mechanism are its stability and its changeability&emdash;the existence of mutations, which allow for the evolution of a biological species. 
The characteristics that are inherited by a child from its mother and father are all contained in several large organic molecules&emdash;the genes. 
Genes are maintained at a fairly high temperature, \SI{98}{\degree\Fahrenheit}, in the human body, which means that they are subject to constant thermal agitation. 
The question is how does this molecule retain its identity through generation after generation. 
Schr&ouml;dinger states the problem brilliantly: &ldquo;Let me throw the truly amazing situation into relief once again. 
Several members of the Habsburg dynasty have a peculiar disfigurement of the lower lip (&#39;Habsburger Lippe&#39;). 
Its inheritance has been studied carefully and published, complete with historical portraits, by the Imperial Academy of Vienna, under the auspices of the family.
&hellip; Fixing our attention on the portraits of a member of the family in the sixteenth century and of his descendant, living in the nineteenth, we may safely assume that the material gene structure responsible for the abnormal feature has been carried on from generation to generation through the centuries, faithfully reproduced at every one of the not very numerous cell divisions that lie between. 
&hellip; The gene has been kept at a temperature around \SI{98}{\degree\Fahrenheit}, during all that time. How are we to understand that it has remained unperturbed by the disordering tendency of the heat motion for centuries?&rdquo; 


According to the quantum theory, the stability of any chemical molecule has a natural explanation. 
The molecule is in a definite energy state. 
To go from one state to another the molecule must absorb just the right amount of energy. 
If too little energy is supplied, the molecule will not make the transition. 
This situation differs completely from that envisaged by classical physics, in which the change of state can be achieved by absorbing any energy. 
It can be shown that the thermal agitations that go on in the human body do not in general supply enough energy to cause such a transition, but mutations can take place in those rare thermal processes in which enough energy is available to alter the gene. 


<em>What Is Life?</em> was published in 1944. 
Since then the field of molecular biology has become one of the most active and exciting in all science. 
A good deal of what Schr&ouml;dinger said is now dated. 
But the book has had an enormous influence on physicists and biologists in that it hints how the two disciplines join together at their base. 
Schr&ouml;dinger, who received the Nobel Prize jointly with Dirac, in 1933, succeeded Max Planck at the University of Berlin in 1927. 
When Hitler came to power, Schr&ouml;dinger, although not a Jew, was deeply affected by the political climate. Philipp Frank has told me that Schr&ouml;dinger attempted to intervene in a Storm Trooper raid on a Jewish ghetto and would have been beaten to death if one of the troopers, who had studied physics, had not recognized him as Germany&#39;s most recent Nobel Laureate and persuaded his colleagues to let him go. 
Shortly afterward, Schr&ouml;dinger went to England, then back to Austria, then to Belgium, when Austria fell, and finally to the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, where he remained until he returned to Vienna, in 1956. 
By the end of his life, he must have mastered as much general culture&emdash;scientific and nonscientific&emdash;as it is possible for any single person to absorb in this age of technical specialization. 
He read widely in several languages, and wrote perceptively about the relation between science and the humanities and about Greek science, in which he was particularly interested.
He even wrote poetry, which, I am told, was extremely romantic. 
(The pictures of Schr&ouml;dinger as a young man give him a Byronic look.) 
What kind of personal metaphysics would such a man derive from his reading and experience? 
In <em>My View of the World</em>, he leaves a partial answer. 


<em>My View of the World</em> consists of two long essays&emdash;one written in 1925, just before the discovery of the Schr&ouml;dinger Equation, and one written in 1960, just before his death. In both essays he reveals himself as a mystic deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Vedas. 
In 1925 he writes, &ldquo;This life of yours which you are living is not merely a piece of the entire existence, but is in a certain sense the <em>whole</em>; only this whole is not so constituted that it can be surveyed in one single glance. 
This, as we know, is what the Brahmins express in that sacred, mystic formula which is yet really so simple and so clear: <em>Tat tvam asi</em>, this is you. Or, again, in such words as &#39;I am in the east and in the west. 
I am below and above, <em>I am this whole world</em>,&#39; &rdquo; and in the later essay he returns to this theme.  \\
He does not attempt to derive or justify his convictions with scientific argument. 
In fact, as he stresses in his preface, he feels that modern science, his own work included, is not relevant to the search for the underlying metaphysical and moral truths by which one lives. 
For him, they must be intuitively, almost mystically arrived at. 
He writes, &ldquo;It is the vision of this truth (of which the individual is seldom conscious in his actions) which underlies all morally valuable activity. 
It brings a man of nobility not only to risk his life for an end which he recognizes or believes to be good but&emdash;in rare cases&emdash;to lay it down in full serenity, even when there is no prospect of saving his own person. 
It guides the hand of the well-doer&emdash;this perhaps even more rarely&emdash;when, without hope of future reward, he gives to relieve a stranger&#39;s suffering what he cannot spare without suffering himself.&rdquo; 


In 1960, I had the chance to visit Schr&ouml;dinger in Vienna. 
I was studying at the Boltzmann Institute for Theoretical Physics, whose director, Walter Thirring, is the son of Hans Thirring, a distinguished Austrian physicist, also a classmate of Schr&ouml;dinger. 
Schr&ouml;dinger had been very ill and he rarely appeared at the Institute. 
But he enjoyed maintaining his contact with physics and the young physicists who were working under Walter Thirring.
Thirring took a small group of us to visit Schr&ouml;dinger. 
He lived in an old-fashioned Viennese apartment house, with a rickety elevator and dimly lit hallways. 
The Schr&ouml;dinger living room-library was piled to the ceiling with books, and Schr&ouml;dinger was in the process of writing the second of the two essays in <em>My View of the World</em>. 
Physically he was extremely frail, but his intellectual vigor was intact. 
He told us some of the lessons that modern scientists might learn from the Greeks. 
In particular, he stressed the recurrent theme of the writings of his later years&emdash;that modern science may be as far from revealing the underlying laws of the natural universe as was the science of ancient Greece. 
It was clear from watching and listening to him that the flame that illuminated his intellectual curiosity throughout his long life still burned brightly at the end of it.
