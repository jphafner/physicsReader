Long ago there lived a retired sea-captain who liked to go to auctions where he bought all sorts of queer things, much to the annoyance of his wife. 
One day he brought home a box with strange hieroglyphics painted all over it and set it down in a place of honour on the table where he kept his trophies. 


As far as could be seen, there was no way of opening the box. 
This aroused the curiosity of the sea-captain and he started carefully to scrape off the rust and grime with which the box was covered. 
To his great delight he found a small shaft or axle protruding from one side of the box, as shown in Fig. I 


He discovered that he could turn this shaft with a pair of pliers, but nothing seemed to happen when he did so. 
Certainly the box did not open. 
`Perhaps I haven&#39;t turned the shaft far enough,&#39; he said to himself, `or perhaps I&#39;m turning it the wrong way.&#39; 


He realized then that he had lost track of the amount by which he had turned the shaft, and rebuked himself severely for not keeping a log. 
He must be more systematic. 


There was a tiny arrow on the end of the shaft, and when the shaft was turned so that this arrow was vertical, it would go no further to the left. 
That he called `the zero position&#39;.  
Then he set to work and fixed a knob on the end of the shaft with a pointer attached and a graduated scale running round the shaft so that he could take readings with the pointer when he turned the shaft (see Fig. 2).
He marked off the scale in units, tenths of units and hundredths of units, but he could not draw any finer divisions. 


He got out one of the old log books he had brought back from the sea and wrote the words `Log of my box&#39; at the top of a blank page. 
He ruled two columns very neatly and wrote at the head of the first column `Date of observation&#39; and at the head of the second column `Reading of pointer&#39;. 

Then he turned the knob, looked at the calendar and the pointer, and made this entry: 

%% NOTE: tabular
<em>Date of observation</em> <em>Reading of pointer</em>
3 March 1453, morning, cloudy, wind fresh S.E. by E. 
2 00 

There was an auction in the neighbourhood that day. 
The sea-captain came home from it in the evening and made another entry: 

%% NOTE: tabular
3 March 1453, evening, 2&#39; 00 
fair, wind slight S.E. by S. 

`We&#39;ll never reach port at this rate,&#39; said the sea-captain to himself `Man the capstan!&#39; 
Then he took the knob and turned the pointer to another position, which he noted in his log; but the box did not open. 
He turned the knob to various positions, noting them all, but still the box did not open. 


By this time he was pretty disgusted and half resolved to throw the box away, but he was afraid his wife would laugh at him. 
He opened his clasp knife and attacked the box in a fury, but succeeded only in knocking off a few flakes of rust and breaking his knife. 
But he was excited to see that he had exposed a second shaft! 
He quickly went to work and fitted this shaft with a knob, pointer and graduated scale, so that it looked as in Fig. \ref{fig:3}.

\caption{Protus and Deutus}
</figure>

Then he turned over a fresh page in his log and ruled three columns. 
The first he headed as before `Date of observation&#39;. 
Then he hesitated. 
He must not get the two pointers mixed up&emdash;he must give them names&emdash;what would he call them? 
Castor and Pollux? Scylla and Charybdis? 
Port and starboard? 


The sea-captain was a long time making up his mind. 
An unlucky name might send a good ship to the bottom on her maiden voyage. 
He rejected for reasons of domestic peace the idea of naming the pointers after girl friends of his youth or even after Greek goddesses. 
He must choose names which would apply to his pointers only and to nothing else, and the only thing to do was to make up names. 
He finally decided on protus for the one he had discovered first and DEUTUS for the one he had discovered second. 
The grammarians might not think much of these names, but the mixture of Greek and Latin sounds had a pleasant ring and should make them safe from confusion with anything else. 
So he now prepared three columns in his log like this: 

%% NOTE: tabular
Date of observation protus deutus 

The sea-captain&#39;s wife thought that he bought things at auctions merely to satisfy a childish yearning to possess curious pieces of rubbish, but that was not the real reason. 
Actually, he was a very avaricious man, and he was convinced that sooner or later he would find a hoard of gold in some trunk or box picked up for next to nothing at an auction. 
That is the reason for the gleam in his eyes as he now grasps the two knobs on the box and prepares to turn them. 
Surely the box will open now! 


But the box does not open. 
Instead, the sea-captain jumps back, shaking in every limb and with his hair on end. 
`Shiver my timbers!&#39; 
he cries. 
`There&#39;s a witch in the fo&#39;c&#39;sle!&#39; 


For, as he had tried to turn the knobs, there seemed to be human hands inside the box resisting his efforts. 


Then cautiously, as if afraid of getting burned, he stretches out his hand to Protus and turns it gently. 
No resistance.  
But he draws back his hand in alarm. 
When he turned Protus, Deutus turned at the same time! 


The sea-captain is no coward. 
In his time he has fought pirates in the Levant and dived last from the bridge of his ship sinking under him in the Bay of Biscay. 
But this is a different matter. 
There is magic in this box, and his conscience is troubled by his secret avarice for gold. 
Muttering a prayer and an incantation he picked up in an Eastern port, he takes up his pen in a shaky hand and with the other starts to manipulate Protus, writing down the figures as he does so. 
He is so excited that he forgets to record the date and the weather. 

%% NOTE: tabular
Here are his readings: 
PROTUS DEUTUS 
00 GOO 
1 00 2*00 
2*00 2*83 
3-00 3-46 
4*00 400 

The box does not open, but he does not care. 
The lust for gold has been replaced by scientific curiosity. 
His sporting instinct is roused.
`Good old Protus!&#39; he cries.
`You made a poor start but you&#39;re gaining. 
Two to one on Protus!&#39; 


He turns Protus further and gets these readings : 

%% NOTE: tabular
PROTUS DEUTUS 
5-00 447 
6-00 4-90 


`Protus wins!&#39; roars the sea-captain, springing to his feet and nearly knocking the table over. 
His wife puts her head round the door. 
`What&#39;s all the noise about?&#39; 
Then she sneers: `Still playing with that silly old box! 
A man of your age!&#39; 


As the days pass, the sea-captain plays the game of Protus versus Deutus over and over again. 
Protus always makes a bad start and Protus always wins. 
It gets boring and he begins to dream a little. 
He forgets that Protus and Deutus were names he made up to distinguish one pointer from the other. 
They take on reality and he begins to think of them as two ships. 
Protus must be a heavy ship and Deutus a little sloop, very quick at the get-away but not able to hold the pace against the sail-spread of Protus. 


But he pulls himself together. 
The lust for gold is now completely gone and the sea-captain starts to ask himself questions. 


What is there really inside the box? 
He toys again with the idea that there may be a witch inside the box, but reason tells him that witches don&#39;t behave like that. 
No witch would reproduce the same readings over and over again.


Since Deutus moves whenever you move Protus, there must be some connection between them. 
Ha! Blocks and tackle, that&#39;s what it must be! 
Very small ivory pulleyblocks and silk threads! 


So the sea-captain stumps down to the dock and gets one of his friends to put his ship at his disposal. 
He tries all sorts of ways of connecting two windlasses so that their motions will reproduce the motions of Protus and Deutus, but it will not work. 
He can easily make one windlass turn faster than the other, but he can never arrange matters so that one windlass makes a bad start and then overtakes the other. 
He returns home dejected. 
He is as wise as before about the contents of the mysterious box. 


He reads over his log again and notices that he has always set Protus to an integer value. 
What would happen if he moved Protus through half a unit to $0.50$? 
He is about to set Protus to $0.50$ when his pride explodes in an oath. 
`Sacred catfish!&#39; he cries. 
`What am I? 
A knob-twiddler and pointerreader? 
No. I am a man&emdash;a man endowed with the gift of reason. 
I shall think it out for myself!&#39; 


Then he ponders: `When Protus goes from $0.00$ to $1.00$, Deutus goes from $0.00$ to $2.00$. 
That means that Deutus goes twice as fast as Protus, at least at the start of the race. 
So when Protus goes from $0.00$ to $0.50$, Deutus will go from $0.00$ to $1.00$. 
That&#39;s obvious!&#39; 
And he writes in the log 

%% NOTE: tabular
PROTUS DEUTUS 
050 I&#39;OO (theoretical) 

By adding that word `theoretical&#39; the sea-captain shows himself to be a cautious, conscientious man, distinguishing what he has deduced from his `theory&#39; from what he observes directly. 
(A noble precedent, often sadly neglected, but much harder to follow than one might suppose at first sight!) 

Was the sea-captain right? No. 
When he actually turned Protus, he had to record the readings as follows: 

%% NOTE: tabular
PROTUS DEUTUS 
0-50 I &#39;41 (observed) 

What do you think of the sea-captain&#39;s `theory&#39;? 
Not bad for 1453, but any modern schoolboy could tell him how to do better. 
He should have taken a sheet of squared paper and plotted a graph, Protus versus Deutus, marking first the points corresponding to the observations made and then drawing a smooth curve through them. 
Then he could have read off from the curve the `theoretical&#39; Deutus-reading corresponding to the Protus-reading 0&#39;50. 
That might have saved him from making a fool of himself, provided that nature does not make jumps. 
That is an assumption always made in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and (as we shall see later) it might have been made here. 


But a graph is not completely satisfactory. 
It is hard to tell another person in a letter the precise shape of the graph; you have to enclose a copy of the graph, and the making of copies of a graph is a nuisance unless you use photography. 
A mathematical formula is always regarded as a much more convenient and satisfactory way of describing a natural law.
The sea-captain had never heard of graphs or photography, but the other idea slowly evolved in his mind. 
Let us continue the story. 


After thinking the matter over for several years, the sea-captain walked down to the pier one evening and stuck up a notice which read as follows: 


DEUTUS IS TWICE THE SQUARE ROOT OF PROTUS 

The people of the sea-port were of course very proud of the sea-captain, and they crowded cheering round the notice-board. 
But there was one young man who did not cheer. 
He had just returned from the University of Paris and took all scientific matters very seriously. 
This young man now pressed through the crowd until he reached the sea-captain, and, taking him by the lapel of his coat, said earnestly `This notice, what does it mean?&#39; 


The sea-captain had been celebrating his discovery and was a little unsteady on his feet. 
He stared belligerently at the young man. 
`Deutus is twice the square root of Protus,&#39; he said. `That&#39;s what it means. 
Can&#39;t you read?&#39; 


`And who is Deutus?&#39; said the young man.
`And who is this creature Protus that has a square root?&#39; 


`You don&#39;t know Protus and Deutus?&#39; 
cried the sea-captain. 


`Why, everyone knows Protus and Deutus! 
Come up to my house and meet them over a glass of grog!&#39; 


So they went up to the sea-captain&#39;s house and he introduced the young man to Protus and Deutus. 
`That&#39;s Protus on the left,&#39; said he, `and Deutus on the right.&#39; 
Then he leaned over and whispered confidentially in the young man&#39;s ear: `Protus carries more sail, but Deutus is quicker on the get-away!&#39; 


The young man looked at the sea-captain coldly. 
`You mean,&#39; he said, `that Protus is a word which stands for the number indicated by the left-hand pointer and Deutus is a word which stands for the number indicated by the righthand pointer. 
When you say that Protus is twice the square root of Deutus, you mean that one of these numbers is twice the square root of the other. 
In Paris we do not use words like Protus and Deutus for numbers. 
We use letters. 
We would write your result 

\begin{equation*}
    D = 2 \sqrt{P}.
\end{equation*}

But is it really true?&#39; 


`Of course it&#39;s true,&#39; said the sea-captain, `and we don&#39;t need all your French fancy-talk to prove it. 
Here, read my ship&#39;s log.&#39; 
He opened the log and showed the young man the readings which you have read on p. 65. 


`Let us see,&#39; said the young man. 
`These things are not so obvious. 
Let us do a little calculation. 
The square root of zero is zero, and twice zero is zero, so the first line is right.&#39; 


He was about to put a check mark opposite the first line when the sea-captain roared `Keep your hands off my log!
Time enough to start writing when you find a mistake, which you won&#39;t. 
You can&#39;t teach a master mariner how to reckon!&#39; 


`To proceed,&#39; went on the young man, `in the second line <span class="math">P</span> is one; the square root of one is one, and twice one is two. 
Quite correct.&#39;
He put out his hand to make a check mark, but withdrew it hastily. 


`In the next line,&#39; he continued, `<span class="math">P</span> is two. 
The square root of two is an irrational number and cannot be represented by a terminating decimal. 
The third line is wrong, in the sense that the law $D = 2 \sqrt{P}$ is not satisfied by these numbers. 


The sea-captain was taken aback. 
`What&#39;s that?&#39; he said.  
`An irrational number? 
I&#39;ve sailed the seven seas, but never did I meet up with an irrational number. 
Take your irrational numbers back where they come from, and don&#39;t try to teach me about Protus and Deutus!&#39; 


`I can put it another way,&#39; said the young man, `If you square both sides of your equation, and then interchange the sides of the equation, you get 

\begin{equation*}
    4P = D^2.
\end{equation*}


Now we shall put in the figures from the third line of your $\log{}P$ is $2.00$ and $D = 2.83$.
Four times <span class="math">P</span> is therefore eight.  
Now we calculate the square of $2.83$; it comes out to be $8.0089$.
So you assert&emdash;or do you?&emdash;that 

\begin{equation*}
    8 \approx 8.0089. 
\end{equation*}


Surely you cannot mean that?&#39; 


The sea-captain scratched his head. 
`That&#39;s not the way I figured it,&#39; he said, `Let&#39;s see now. 
Protus is $2.00$. 
What is the square root of $2.00$?
Why, it&#39;s $1.4142$.
If you double that you get $2.8284$, and that is $2.83$ to the nearest second decimal place. 
You can&#39;t trip me up, my boy. 
The law is satisfied all right,&#39; 


`Honest sir,&#39; said the young man, smoothing his Parisian hair-cut, `do you tell me that 

\begin{equation*}
    2.8284 = 2.83\text{?&#39;} 
\end{equation*}

`Yes,&#39; said the sea-captain stoutly, &#39;it is. Those numbers 
are equal to two decimal places.&#39; 

The young man jumped to his feet in anger. 
`What a waste of my time!&#39; 
he cried. 
`It is a lying notice you have posted on the pier! 
Go down and add to it those words which will make it true.&#39; 


`And what words might those be?&#39; 
asked the sea-captain suspiciously. 


`Write that Deutus is twice the square root of Protus to two decimal places.&#39;


`I will not,&#39; replied the sea-captain stubbornly. 
`Everybody knows that Protus and Deutus have only two decimal places and they don&#39;t need to be told. 
Keep your irrational numbers and other French fiddle-faddle away from Protus and Deutus. 
Commonsense is enough for them. 
But,&#39; he added, `you&#39;re a nice young fellow for a land-lubber, so sit ye down and we&#39;ll have a glass of grog together.&#39; 


So the young man sat down for a glass of grog and as the evening wore on the two became more and more friendly and open-hearted with one another. 
Finally, speaking at once, they both broke out with the question: `What is inside the box?&#39; 


The sea-captain told the young man how he had first thought that there was gold in the box, how then he had thought that there must be a witch, and now for the life of him he could think of nothing but that there were two ships, Protus with a great sail-spread and Deutus smaller and quicker on the get-away. 
`But,&#39; he added, `it bothers me how you could fit ships in such a little box, with a sea for them to sail on and a wind to sail by. 
And how is it that they always sail the same, with Protus slow at first and Deutus quick on the get-away?&#39; 


Not having followed the sea, the young man paid little attention to the idea of the two ships. 
Then suddenly he stood up and stared at the box. 
He had now drunk several glasses of grog, so he stood with difficulty and leaned heavily on the table. 


`I see it,&#39; he said.
`Yes, I see it!&#39; 

`What do you see?&#39; 
asked the sea-captain. 
`Protus with her tops&#39;ls set?&#39; 
And he too stared at the box. 


`I see no ships,&#39; said the young man, speaking slowly at first and then more and more rapidly. 
`I see a world of mathematics. 
I see two variable numbers, <span class="math">P</span> and <span class="math">D</span>, taking all values rational and irrational from zero to infinity. 
What fools we were to talk of two decimal places! 
The law is exactly $D = 2 \sqrt{P}$. 
It is true for all values, rational and irrational. 
Protus is a number and Deutus is a number, and if you cannot measure them to more than two decimal places, that is your infirmity, not theirs. 
Go,&#39; he cried to the sea-captain, 
`go to the silversmith and make him contrive for you more cunning scales so that they may be read more accurately. 
I will go to Paris and procure some optic glasses wherewith to read the scales. 
Then you will see that I am right. 
The law $D = 2 \sqrt{P}$ is an exact mathematical law and you will verify it with readings that go to four or five or six decimal places.&#39; 


The sea-captain yawned.
`The silversmith is now abed,&#39; he said, `and with the wind now holding you cannot sail for France. 
It may be that this grog has been too much for your young stomach. 
Lie down on the couch there and sleep it off.&#39; 


But before long the silversmith made the cunning scales and the young man brought the optic glasses from Paris; to the great surprise of the sea-captain, the young man was right&emdash;the law was satisfied to two more decimal places. 
Beyond that they could not go, although the young man married the sea-captain&#39;s daughter and worked with his father-in-law on the box for many years. 
The sea-captain died thinking of Protus and Deutus racing in a stiff breeze and bequeathed the box to the young man, who in course of time grew old and died too. 
The box was handed down from generation to generation as a family heirloom, and it was a point of honour with each generation to try to add a decimal place to the readings and see whether the law $D = 2\sqrt{P}$ remained true. 
Generation after generation found that it did remain true, and finally the idea that there might be any doubt about it faded. 


No one has ever succeeded in getting inside the box, and there is a mixed tradition as to what its contents are. 
Gold and witches were ruled out long ago, but still some members of the family see Protus and Deutus sailing with foaming wakes where others see two variable numbers capable of taking all positive values, rational and irrational. 


An allegory must not be pushed too far, and so one hesitates to say what has happened to the sea-captain&#39;s box in these days of relativity and quantum mechanics. 
You might say that if you look very hard at Protus, your mere inspection disturbs him, and when you feel quite certain you have pinned him down to a definite reading Deutus is dancing all over the place. 
Or perhaps you might say that the two pointers do not move continuously but only in definite small jumps. 


However, the whole picture is blurred by the discovery of a vast number of shafts, connected to one another by many complicated laws which the sea-captain would find it impossible to visualize in terms of nautical manoeuvres. 


But the essential feature of the allegory remains&emdash;the unopened and unopenable box, and the question: &#39;What is really inside it?&#39; 
Is it the world of mathematics, or can it be explained in terms of ships and shoes and sealing wax? 


The answer must surely be a subjective matter; if you ask for an &#39;explanation&#39;, you cannot be satisfied unless the explanation you get rings a bell somewhere inside you. 
If you are a mathematician, you will respond to a mathematical explanation, but if you are not, then probably you will want an explanation which establishes analogies between the deep laws of nature and simple facts of ordinary life. 


Up to the year 1900, roughly, such homely explanations were available. 
It is true that they never told the whole story (that inevitably involved mathematics), but they provided crusts for the teeth of the mind to bite on. 
The earth pursues its orbit round the sun on account of the pull of gravity; then think of an apple with a string through it which you whirl round your head. 
Light travels from the sun to the earth in ether-waves; then think of the ripples on the surface of a pond when you throw a stone into it. 


Modern physics tends to decry &#39;explanations&#39; of this sort&emdash;not out of any malevolent desire to hide secrets, but because the simple analogies prove too deceptive and inadequate. 
In fact there are those who deny that physicists have the responsibility of giving explanations. 
This modern attitude has been expressed compactly by Professor Dirac: `The only object of theoretical physics is to calculate results that can be compared with experiment, and it is quite unnecessary that any satisfying description of the whole course of the phenomena should be given.&#39;

A new creed! 
Something to weigh and consider and contrast with the old creed implicit in science for centuries.
