In general we look for a new law by the following process. 
First we guess it. 
Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see what would be implied if this law that we guessed is right. 
Then we compare the result of the computation to nature, with experiment or experience, compare it directly with observation, to see if it works. 
If it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. 
In that simple statement is the key to science. 
It does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is. 
It does not make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess, or what his name is&emdash;if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong. 
That is all there is to it. 
It is true that one has to check a little to make sure that it is wrong, because whoever did the experiment may have reported incorrectly, or there may have been some feature in the experiment that was not noticed, some dirt or something; or the man who computed the consequences, even though it may have been the one who made the guesses, could have made some mistake in the analysis. 
These are obvious remarks, so when I say if it disagrees with experiment it is wrong, I mean after the experiment has been checked, the calculations have been checked, and the thing has been rubbed back and forth a few times to make sure that the consequences are logical consequences from the guess, and that in fact it disagrees with a very carefully checked experiment. 


This will give you a somewhat wrong impression of science. 
It suggests that we keep on guessing possibilities and comparing them with experiment, and this is to put experiment into a rather weak position. 
In fact experimenters have a certain individual character. 
They like to do experiments even if nobody has guessed yet, and they very often do their experiments in a region in which people know the theorist has not made any guesses. 
For instance, we may know a great many laws, but do not know whether they really work at high energy, because it is just a good guess that they work at high energy. 
Experimenters have tried experiments at higher energy, and in fact every once in a while experiment produces trouble; that is, it produces a discovery that one of the things we thought right is wrong. 
In this way experiment can produce unexpected results, and that starts us guessing again. 
One instance of an unexpected result is the mu meson and its neutrino, which was not guessed by anybody at all before it was discovered, and even today nobody yet has any method of guessing by which this would be a natural result. 


You can see, of course, that with this method we can attempt to disprove any definite theory. 
If we have a definite theory, a real guess, from which we can conveniently compute consequences which can be compared with experiment, then in principle we can get rid of any theory. 
There is always the possibility of proving any definite theory wrong, but notice that we can never prove it right. 
Suppose that you invent a good guess, calculate the consequences, and discover every time that the consequences you have calculated agree with experiment. 
The theory is then right? 
No, it is simply not proved wrong. 
In the future you could compute a wider range of consequences, there could be a wider range of experiments, and you might then discover that the thing is wrong. 
That is why laws like Newton&#39;s laws for the motion of planets last such a long time. 
He guessed the law of gravitation, calculated all kinds of consequences for the system and so on, compared them with experiment&emdash;and it took several hundred years before the slight error of the motion of Mercury was observed. 
During all that time the theory had not been proved wrong, and could be taken temporarily to be right. 
But it could never be proved right, because tomorrow&#39;s experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right. 
We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong. 
However, it is rather remarkable how we can have some ideas which will last so long. 


One of the ways of stopping science would be only to do experiments in the region where you know the law. 
But experimenters search most diligently, and with the greatest effort, in exactly those places where it seems most likely that we can prove our theories wrong. 
In other words we are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress. 
For example, today among ordinary low energy phenomena we do not know where to look for trouble, we think everything is all right, and so there is no particular big programme looking for trouble in nuclear reactions, or in super-conductivity.  
In these lectures I am concentrating on discovering fundamental laws. 
The whole range of physics, which is interesting, includes also an understanding at another level of these phenomena like super-conductivity and nuclear reactions, in terms of the fundamental laws. 
But I am talking now about discovering trouble, something wrong with the fundamental laws, and since among low energy phenomena nobody knows where to look, all the experiments today in this field of finding out a new law, are of high energy. 


Another thing I must point out is that you cannot prove a vague theory wrong. 
If the guess that you make is poorly expressed and rather vague, and the method that you use for figuring out the consequences is a little vague&emdash;you are not sure, and you say, &#39;I think everything&#39;s right because it&#39;s all due to so and so, and such and such do this and that more or less, and I can sort of explain how this works &hellip;{}&#39;, then you see that this theory is good, because it cannot be proved wrong! Also if the process of computing the consequences is indefinite, then with a httle skill any experimental results can be made to look like the expected consequences. You are probably famihar with that in other fields. 
`A&#39; hates his mother. 
The reason is, of course, because she did not caress him or love him enough when he was a child. 
But if you investigate you find out that as a matter of fact she did love him very much, and everything was all right. 
Well then, it was because she was over-indulgent when he was a child!
By having a vague theory it is possible to get either result. 
The cure for this one is the following. 
If it were possible to state exactly, ahead of time, how much love is not enough, and how much love is over-indulgent, then there would be a perfectly legitimate theory against which you could make tests. 
It is usually said when this is pointed out, `When you are deahng with psychological matters things can&#39;t be defined so precisely&#39;. 
Yes, but then you cannot claim to know anything about it. 


You will be horrified to hear that we have examples in physics of exactly the same kind. 
We have these approximate symmetries, which work something like this. 
You have an approximate symmetry, so you calculate a set of consequences supposing it to be perfect. 
When compared with experiment, it does not agree. 
Of course&emdash;the symmetry you are supposed to expect is approximate, so if the agreement is pretty good you say, `Nice!&#39;, while if the agreement is very poor you say, `Well, this particular thing must be especially sensitive to the failure of the symmetry&#39;. 
Now you may laugh, but we have to make progress in that way. 
When a subject is first new, and these particles are new to us, this jockeying around, this `feeling&#39; way of guessing at the results, is the beginning of any science. 
The same thing is true of the symmetry proposition in physics as is true of psychology, so do not laugh too hard. 
It is necessary in the beginning to be very careful. 
It is easy to fall into the deep end by this kind of vague theory. 
It is hard to prove it wrong, and it takes a certain skill and experience not to walk off the plank in the game. 


In this process of guessing, computing consequences, and comparing with experiment, we can get stuck at various stages. 
We may get stuck in the guessing stage, when we have no ideas. 
Or we may get stuck in the computing stage. 
For example, Yukawa
\footnote{
    Hideki Yukawa, Japanese physicist. 
    Director of Research Institute for Fundamental Physics at Kyoto. 
    Nobel Prize 1949. 
}
guessed an idea for the nuclear forces in 1934, but nobody could compute the consequences because the mathematics was too difficult, and so they could not compare his idea with experiment. 
The theories remained for a long time, until we discovered all these extra particles which were not contemplated by Yukawa, and therefore it is undoubtedly not as simple as the way Yukawa did it. 
Another place where you can get stuck is at the experimental end. 
For example, the quantum theory of gravitation is going very slowly, if at all, because all the experiments that you can do never involve quantum mechanics and gravitation at the same time. 
The gravity force is too weak compared with the electrical force. 


Because I am a theoretical physicist, and more delighted with this end of the problem, I want now to concentrate on how you make the guesses. 


As I said before, it is not of any importance where the guess comes from; it is only important that it should agree with experiment, and that it should be as definite as possible. 
`Then&#39;, you say, `that is very simple. 
You set up a machine, a great computing machine, which has a random wheel in it that makes a succession of guesses, and each time it guesses a hypothesis about how nature should work it computes immediately the consequences, and makes a comparison with a Ust of experimental results it has at the other end&#39;. 
In other words, guessing is a dumb man&#39;s job. 
Actually it is quite the opposite, and I will try to explain why. 


The first problem is how to start. 
You say, `Well I&#39;d start off with all the known principles&#39;. 
But all the principles that are known are inconsistent with each other, so something has to be removed. 
We get a lot of letters from people insisting that we ought to makes holes in our guesses. 
You see, you make a hole, to make room for a new guess. 
Somebody says, `You know, you people always say that space is continuous. 
How do you know when you get to a small enough dimension that there really are enough points in between, that it isn&#39;t just a lot of dots separated by Httle distances?&#39; Or they say, `You know those quantum mechanical amplitudes you told me about, they&#39;re so complicated and absurd, what makes you think those are right? 
Maybe they aren&#39;t right&#39;. 
Such remarks are obvious and are perfectly clear to anybody who is working on this problem. 
It does not do any good to point this out. 
The problem is not only what might be wrong but what, precisely, might be substituted in place of it. 
In the case of the continuous space, suppose the precise proposition is that space really consists of a series of dots, and that the space between them does not mean anything, and that the dots are in a cubic array. 
Then we can prove immediately that this is wrong. 
It does not work. 
The problem is not just to say something might be wrong, but to replace it by something&emdash;and that is not so easy. 
As soon as any really definite idea is substituted it becomes almost immediately apparent that it does not work. 


The second difficulty is that there is an infinite number of possibilities of these simple types. 
It is something like this.  
You are sitting working very hard, you have worked for a long time trying to open a safe. 
Then some Joe comes along who knows nothing about what you are doing, except that you are trying to open the safe. 
He says `Why don&#39;t you try the combination 10:20:30?&#39; 
Because you are busy, you have tried a lot of things, maybe you have already tried 10:20:30. 
Maybe you know already that the middle number is 32 not 20. 
Maybe you know as a matter of fact that it is a five digit combination&hellip; .
So please do not send me any letters trying to tell me how the thing is going to work. 
I read them&emdash;I always read them to make sure that I have not already thought of what is suggested&emdash;but it takes too long to answer them, because they are usually in the class `try 10:20:30&#39;. 
As usual, nature&#39;s imagination far surpasses our own, as we have seen from the other theories which are subtle and deep. 
To get such a subtle and deep guess is not so easy. One must be really clever to guess, and it is not possible to do it bUndly by machine. 


I want to discuss now the art of guessing nature&#39;s laws. 
It is an art. 
How is it done? 
One way you might suggest is to look at history to see how the other guys did it. 
So we look at history. 


We must start with Newton. 
He had a situation where he had incomplete knowledge, and he was able to guess the laws by putting together ideas which were all relatively close to experiment; there was not a great distance between the observations and the tests. 
That was the first way, but today it does not work so well. 


The next guy who did something great was Maxwell, who obtained the laws of electricity and magnetism. 
What he did was this. 
He put together all the laws of electricity, due to Faraday and other people who came before him, and he looked at them and reaUzed that they were mathematically inconsistent. 
In order to straighten it out he had to add one term to an equation. 
He did this by inventing for himself a model of idler wheels and gears and so on in space. 
He found what the new law was&emdash;but nobody paid much attention because they did not believe in the idler wheels. 
We do not beheve in the idler wheels today, but the equations that he obtained were correct. 
So the logic may be wrong but the answer right. 


In the case of relativity the discovery was completely different. 
There was an accumulation of paradoxes; the known laws gave inconsistent results. 
This was a new kind of thinking, a thinking in terms of discussing the possible symmetries of laws. 
It was especially difficult, because for the first time it was reaUzed how long something like Newton&#39;s laws could seem right, and still ultimately be wrong. 
Also it was difficult to accept that ordinary ideas of time and space, which seemed so instinctive, could be wrong. 


Quantum mechanics was discovered in two independent ways&emdash;which is a lesson. 
There again, and even more so, an enormous number of paradoxes were discovered experimentally, things that absolutely could not be explained in any way by what was known. 
It was not that the knowledge was incomplete, but that the knowledge was too complete. 
Your prediction was that this should happen&emdash;it did not. 
The two different routes were one by Schrodinger,
\footnote{
    Erwin Schrodinger, Austrian theoretical physicist. 
    Won Nobel Prize for Physics 1933 with Paul Dirac. 
}
who guessed the equation, the other by Heisenberg, who argued that you must analyse what is measurable. 
These two different philosophical methods led to the same discovery in the end. 


More recently, the discovery of the laws of the weak decay I spoke of, when a neutron disintegrates into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino&emdash;which are still only partly known&emdash;add up to a somewhat different situation. 
This time it was a case of incomplete knowledge, and only the equation was guessed. 
The special difficulty this time was that the experiments were all wrong. 
How can you guess the right answer if, when you calculate the result, it disagrees with experiment? 
You need courage to say the experiments must be wrong. 
I will explain where that courage comes from later. 


Today we have no paradoxes&emdash;maybe. 
We have this infinity that comes in when we put all the laws together, but the people sweeping the dirt under the rug are so clever that one sometimes thinks this is not a serious paradox. 
Again, the fact that we have found all these particles does not tell us anything except that our knowledge is incomplete. 
I am sure that history does not repeat itself in physics, as you can tell from looking at the examples I have given. 
The reason is this. 
Any schemes&emdash;such as `think of symmetry laws&#39;, or &#39;put the information in mathematical form&#39;, or `guess equations&#39;&emdash;are known to everybody now, and they are all tried all the time. 
When you are stuck, the answer cannot be one of these, because you will have tried these right away. 


There must be another way next time. 
Each time we get into this log-jam of too much trouble, too many problems, it is because the methods that we are using are just like the ones we have used before. 
The next scheme, the new discovery, is going to be made in a completely different way. 
So history does not help us much. 


I should Uke to say a httle about Heisenberg&#39;s idea that you should not talk about what you cannot measure, because many people talk about this idea without really understanding it. 
You can interpret this in the sense that the constructs or inventions that you make must be of such a kind that the consequences that you compute are comparable with experiment&emdash;that is, that you do not compute a consequence like `a moo must be three goos&#39;, when nobody knows what a moo or a goo is. 
Obviously that is no good. 
But if the consequences can be compared to experiment, then that is all that is necessary. 
It does not matter that moos and goos cannot appear in the guess. 
You can have as much junk in the guess as you like, provided that the consequences can be compared with experiment. 
This is not always fully appreciated. 
People often complain of the unwarranted extension of the ideas of particles and paths, etc., into the atomic realm. 
Not so at all; there is nothing unwarranted about the extension. 
We must, and we should, and we always do, extend as far as we can beyond what we already know, beyond those ideas that we have already obtained. 
Dangerous? Yes.
Uncertain? Yes.
But it is the only way to make progress. 
Although it is uncertain, it is necessary to make science useful. 
Science is only useful if it tells you about some experiment that has not been done; it is no good if it only tells you what just went on. 
It is necessary to extend the ideas beyond where they have been tested. 
For example, in the law of gravitation, which was developed to understand the motion of planets, it would have been no use if Newton had simply said, I now understand the planets&#39;, and had not felt able to try to compare it with the earth&#39;s pull on the moon, and for later men to say `Maybe what holds the galaxies together is gravitation&#39;. 
We must try that. You could say, `When you get to the size of the galaxies, since you know nothing about it, anything can happen&#39;. 
I know, but there is no science in accepting this type of limitation. 
There is no ultimate understanding of the galaxies. 
On the other hand, if you assume that the entire behaviour is due only to known laws, this assumption is very limited and definite and easily broken by experiment. 
What we are looking for is just such hypotheses, very definite and easy to compare with experiment. 
The fact is that the way the galaxies behave so far does not seem to be against the proposition. 


I can give you another example, even more interesting and important. 
Probably the most powerful single assumption that contributes most to the progress of biology is the assumption that everything animals do the atoms can do, that the things that are seen in the biological world are the results of the behaviour of physical and chemical phenomena, with no `extra something&#39;. 
You could always say, `When you come to living things, anything can happen&#39;. 
If you accept that you will never understand living things. 
It is very hard to believe that the wiggling of the tentacle of the octopus is nothing but some fooling around of atoms according to the known physical laws. 
But when it is investigated with this hypothesis one is able to make guesses quite accurately about how it works. 
In this way one makes great progress in understanding. 
So far the tentacle has not been cut off&emdash;it has not been found that this idea is wrong. 


It is not unscientific to make a guess, although many people who are not in science think it is. 
Some years ago I had a conversation with a layman about flying saucers&emdash;because I am scientific I know all about flying saucers! 
I said `I don&#39;t think there are flying saucers&#39;.
So my antagonist said, `Is it impossible that there are flying saucers? 
Can you prove that it&#39;s impossible?&#39; 
`No&#39;, I said, `I can&#39;t prove it&#39;s impossible. 
It&#39;s just very unlikely&#39;.
At that he said, `You are very unscientific. 
If you can&#39;t prove it impossible then how can you say that it&#39;s unlikely?&#39; 
But that is the way that is scientific. 
It is scientific only to say what is more likely and what less likely, and not to be proving all the time the possible and impossible. 
To define what I mean, I might have said to him, `Listen, I mean that from my knowledge of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports of flying saucers are the results of the known irrational characteristics of terrestrial intelligence than of the unknown rational efforts of extra-terrestrial intelligence&#39;.
It is just more likely, that is all. 
It is a good guess. 
And we always try to guess the most likely explanation, keeping in the back of the mind the fact that if it does not work we must discuss the other possibilities. 


How can we guess what to keep and what to throw away?
We have all these nice principles and known facts, but we are in some kind of trouble: either we get the infinities, or we do not get enough of a description&emdash;we are missing some parts. 
Sometimes that means that we have to throw away some idea; at least in the past it has always turned out that some deeply held idea had to be thrown away. 
The question is, what to throw away and what to keep. 
If you throw it all away that is going a httle far, and then you have not much to work with. 
After all, the conservation of energy looks good, and it is nice, and I do not want to throw it away. 
To guess what to keep and what to throw away takes considerable skill. 
Actually it is probably merely a matter of luck, but it looks as if it takes considerable skill. 


Probability amplitudes are very strange, and the first thing you think is that the strange new ideas are clearly cock-eyed. 
Yet everything that can be deduced from the ideas of the existence of quantum mechanical probability amplitudes, strange though they are, do work, throughout the long list of strange particles, one hundred per cent. 
Therefore I do not believe that when we find out the inner guts of the composition of the world we shall find these ideas are wrong. 
I think this part is right, but I am only guessing: I am telling you how I guess. 


On the other hand, I believe that the theory that space is continuous is wrong, because we get these infinities and other difficulties, and we are left with questions on what determines the size of all the particles. 
I rather suspect that the simple ideas of geometry, extended down into infinitely small space, are wrong. 
Here, of course, I am only making a hole, and not telling you what to substitute. 
If I did, I should finish this lecture with a new law. 


Some people have used the inconsistency of all the principles to say that there is only one possible consistent world, that if we put all the principles together, and calculate very exactly, we shall not only be able to deduce the principles, but we shall also discover that these are the only principles that could possibly exist if the thing is still to remain consistent. 
That seems to me a big order. 
I believe that sounds like wagging the dog by the tail. 
I beUeve that it has to be given that certain things exist&emdash;not all the 50-odd particles, but a few httle things like electrons, etc.&emdash;and then with all the principles the great complexities that come out are probably a definite consequence. 
I do not think that you can get the whole thing from arguments about consistencies. 


Another problem we have is the meaning of the partial symmetries. 
These symmetries, like the statement that neutrons and protons are nearly the same but are not the same for electricity, or the fact that the law of reflection symmetry is perfect except for one kind of reaction, are very annoying. 
The thing is almost symmetrical but not completely. 
Now two schools of thought exist. 
One will say that it is really simple, that they are really symmetrical but that there is a little complication which knocks it a bit cock-eyed. 
Then there is another school of thought, which has only one representative, myself, which says no, the thing may be complicated and become simple only through the complications. 
The Greeks believed that the orbits of the planets were circles. Actually they are ellipses. 
They are not quite symmetrical, but they are very close to circles. 
The question is, why are they very close to circles? 
Why are they nearly symmetrical?
Because of a long complicated effect of tidal friction&emdash;a very complicated idea. 
It is possible that nature in her heart is completely unsymmetrical in these things, but in the complexities of reahty it gets to look approximately as if it is symmetrical, and the ellipses look almost like circles. 
That is another possibihty; but nobody knows, it is just guesswork. 


Suppose you have two theories, <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span>, which look completely different psychologically, with different ideas in them and so on, but that all the consequences that are computed from each are exactly the same, and both agree with experiment. 
The two theories, although they sound different at the beginning, have all consequences the same, which is usually easy to prove mathematically by showing that the logic from <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> will always give corresponding consequences. 
Suppose we have two such theories, how are we going to decide which one is right? 
There is no way by science, because they both agree with experiment to the same extent. 
So two theories, although they may have deeply different ideas behind them, may be mathematically identical, and then there is no scientific way to distinguish them.


However, for psychological reasons, in order to guess new theories, these two things may be very far from equivalent, because one gives a man different ideas from the other. 
By putting the theory in a certain kind of framework you get an idea of what to change. 
There will be something, for instance, in theory <span class="math">A</span> that talks about something, and you will say, Til change that idea in here. 
But to find out what the corresponding thing is that you are going to change in <span class="math">B</span> may be very complicated&emdash;it may not be a simple idea at all. 
In other words, although they are identical before they are changed, there are certain ways of changing one which looks natural which will not look natural in the other. 
Therefore psychologically we must keep all the theories in our heads, and every theoretical physicist who is any good knows six or seven different theoretical representations for exactly the same physics. 
He knows that they are all equivalent, and that nobody is ever going to be able to decide which one is right at that level, but he keeps them in his head, hoping that they will give him different ideas for guessing. 


That reminds me of another point, that the philosophy or ideas around a theory may change enormously when there are very tiny changes in the theory. 
For instance, Newton&#39;s ideas about space and time agreed with experiment very well, but in order to get the correct motion of the orbit of Mercury, which was a tiny, tiny difference, the difference in the character of the theory needed was enormous. 
The reason is that Newton&#39;s laws were so simple and so perfect, and they produced definite results. 
In order to get something that would produce a slightly different result it had to be completely different. 
In stating a new law you cannot make imperfections on a perfect thing; you have to have another perfect thing. So the differences in philosophical ideas between Newton&#39;s and Einstein&#39;s theories of gravitation are enormous. 


What are these philosophies?
They are really tricky ways to compute consequences quickly. 
A philosophy, which is sometimes called an understanding of the law, is simply a way that a person holds the laws in his mind in order to guess quickly at consequences. 
Some people have said, and it is true in cases like Maxwell&#39;s equations, `Never mind the philosophy, never mind anything of this kind, just guess the equations. 
The problem is only to compute the answers so that they agree with experiment, and it is not necessary to have a philosophy, or argument, or words, about the equation&#39;.
That is good in the sense that if you only guess the equation you are not prejudicing yourself, and you will guess better. 
On the other hand, maybe the philosophy helps you to guess. 
It is very hard to say. 


For those people who insist that the only thing that is important is that the theory agrees with experiment, I would like to imagine a discussion between a Mayan astronomer and his student. 
The Mayans were able to calculate with great precision predictions, for example, for eclipses and for the position of the moon in the sky, the position of Venus, etc. 
It was all done by arithmetic. 
They counted a certain number and subtracted some numbers, and so on. 
There was no discussion of what the moon was. 
There was no discussion even of the idea that it went around. 
They just calculated the time when there would be an eclipse, or when the moon would rise at the full, and so on. 
Suppose that a young man went to the astronomer and said, `I have an idea. 
Maybe those things are going around, and there are balls of something like rocks out there, and we could calculate how they move in a completely different way from just calculating what time they appear in the sky&#39;. 
`Yes&#39;, says the astronomer, `and how accurately can you predict eclipses?&#39;
He says, `I haven&#39;t developed the thing very far yet&#39;.
Then says the astronomer, `Well, we can calculate eclipses more accurately than you can with your model, so you must not pay any attention to your idea because obviously the mathematical scheme is better&#39;. 
There is a very strong tendency, when someone comes up with an idea and says, `Let&#39;s suppose that the world is this way&#39;, for people to say to him, `What would you get for the answer to such and such a problem?&#39;
And he says, `I haven&#39;t developed it far enough&#39;. 
And they say, `Well, we have already developed it much further, and we can get the answers very accurately&#39;.
So it is a problem whether or not to worry about philosophies behind ideas. 


Another way of working, of course, is to guess new principles. 
In Einstein&#39;s theory of gravitation he guessed, on top of all the other principles, the principle that corresponded to the idea that the forces are always proportional to the masses. 
He guessed the principle that if you are in an accelerating car you cannot distinguish that from being in a gravitational field, and by adding that principle to all the other principles, he was able to deduce the correct laws of gravitation. 


That outlines a number of possible ways of guessing. 
I would now like to come to some other points about the final result. 
First of all, when we are all finished, and we have a mathematical theory by which we can compute consequences, what can we do?
It really is an amazing thing. 
In order to figure out what an atom is going to do in a given situation we make up rules with marks on paper, carry them into a machine which has switches that open and close in some complicated way, and the result will tell us what the atom is going to do! 
If the way that these switches open and close were some kind of model of the atom, if we thought that the atom had switches in it, then I would say that I understood more or less what is going on. 
I find it quite amazing that it is possible to predict what will happen by mathematics, which is simply following rules which really have nothing to do with what is going on in the original thing. 
The closing and opening of switches in a computer is quite different from what is happening in nature. 


One of the most important things in this `guess&emdash;compute consequences&emdash;compare with experiment&#39; business is to know when you are right. 
It is possible to know when you are right way ahead of checking all the consequences. 
You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity. 
It is always easy when you have made a guess, and done two or three little calculations to make sure that it is not obviously wrong, to know that it is right. 
When you get it right, it is obvious that it is right&emdash;at least if you have any experience&emdash;because usually what happens is that more comes out than goes in. 
Your guess is, in fact, that something is very simple. 
If you cannot see immediately that it is wrong, and it is simpler than it was before, then it is right. 
The inexperienced, and crackpots, and people like that, make guesses that are simple, but you can immediately see that they are wrong, so that does not count. 
Others, the inexperienced students, make guesses that are very complicated, and it sort of looks as if it is all right, but I know it is not true because the truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought. 
What we need is imagination, but imagination in a terrible strait-jacket. 
We have to find a new view of the world that has to agree with everything that is known, but disagree in its predictions somewhere, otherwise it is not interesting. 
And in that disagreement it must agree with nature. 
If you can find any other view of the world which agrees over the entire range where things have already been observed, but disagrees somewhere else, you have made a great discovery. 
It is very nearly impossible, but not quite, to find any theory which agrees with experiments over the entire range in which all theories have been checked, and yet gives different consequences in some other range, even a theory whose different consequences do not turn out to agree with nature. 
A new idea is extremely difficult to think of. 
It takes a fantastic imagination. 


What of the future of this adventure?
What will happen ultimately?
We are going along guessing the laws; how many laws are we going to have to guess?
I do not know. 
Some of my colleagues say that this fundamental aspect of our science will go on; but I think there will certainly not be perpetual novelty, say for a thousand years. 
This thing cannot keep on going so that we are always going to discover more and more new laws. 
If we do, it will become boring that there are so many levels one underneath the other. 
It seems to me that what can happen in the future is either that all the laws become known&emdash;that is, if you had enough laws you could compute consequences and they would always agree with experiment, which would be the end of the line&emdash;or it may happen that the experiments get harder and harder to make, more and more expensive, so you get \num{99.9} per cent of the phenomena, but there is always some phenomenon which has just been discovered, which is very hard to measure, and which disagrees; and as soon as you have the explanation of that one there is always another one, and it gets slower and slower and more and more uninteresting. 
That is another way it may end. 
But I think it has to end in one way or another. 


We are very lucky to live in an age in which we are still making discoveries. 
It is like the discovery of America&emdash;you only discover it once. 
The age in which we live is the age in which we are discovering the fundamental laws of nature, and that day will never come again. 
It is very exciting, it is marvellous, but this excitement will have to go. 
Of course in the future there will be other interests. 
There will be the interest of the connection of one level of phenomena to another&emdash;phenomena in biology and so on, or, if you are talking about exploration, exploring other planets, but there will not still be the same things that we are doing now. 


Another thing that will happen is that ultimately, if it turns out that all is known, or it gets very dull, the vigorous philosophy and the careful attention to all these things that I have been talking about will gradually disappear. 
The philosophers who are always on the outside making stupid remarks will be able to close in, because we cannot push them away by saying, `If you were right we would be able to guess all the rest of the laws&#39;, because when the laws are all there they will have an explanation for them. 
For instance, there are always explanations about why the world is three-dimensional. 
Well, there is only one world, and it is hard to tell if that explanation is right or not, so that if everything were known there would be some explanation about why those were the right laws. 
But that explanation would be in a frame that we cannot criticize by arguing that that type of reasoning will not permit us to go further. 
There will be a degeneration of ideas, just like the degeneration that great explorers feel is occurring when tourists begin moving in on a territory. 


In this age people are experiencing a dehght, the tremendous delight that you get when you guess how nature will work in a new situation never seen before. 
From experiments and information in a certain range you can guess what is going to happen in a region where no one has ever explored before. 
It is a little different from regular exploration in that there are enough clues on the land discovered to guess what the land that has not been discovered is going to look like. 
These guesses, incidentally, are often very different from what you have already seen&emdash;they take a lot of thought. 


What is it about nature that lets this happen, that it is possible to guess from one part what the rest is going to do?  
That is an unscientific question: I do not know how to answer it, and therefore I am going to give an unscientific answer. 
I think it is because nature has a simplicity and therefore a great beauty.
