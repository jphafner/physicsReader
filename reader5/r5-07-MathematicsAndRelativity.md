## Mathematics as Language

The scientist, collecting information, formulating schemes, building knowledge, needs to express himself in clear language; but ordinary languages are much more vague and imreliable than most people think.
&ldquo;I love vegetables&rdquo; is so vague that it is almost a disgrace to a civilized language&mdash;a few savage cries could make as full a statement.
&ldquo;A thermometer told me the temperatme of the bath water.&rdquo;
Thermometers don&#39;t &ldquo;tell.&rdquo;
All you do is try to decide on its reading by staring at it&mdash;and you are almost certainly a little wrong.
A thermometer does not show the temperature of the water; it shows its own temperature.
Some of these quarrels relate to the physics of the matter, but they are certainly not helped by the wording. We can make our statements safer by being more careful; but our science still emerges with wording that needs a series of explanatory footnotes. In contrast, the language of mathematics says what it means with amazing brevity and honesty.
When we write <span class="math">2x<sup>2</sup>&minus;3x + 1 = 0</span> we make a very definite, though very dull, statement about <span class="math">x</span>.
One advantage of using mathematics in science is that we can make it write what we want to say with accuracy, avoiding vagueness and unwanted extra meanings.
The remark &ldquo;<span class="math">&Delta;v/&Delta;t=32</span>&rdquo; makes a clear statement without dragging in a long, wordy description of acceleration, <span class="math">y=16t<sup>2</sup></span> tells us how a rock falls without adding any comments on mass or gravity.

Mathematics is of great use as a shorthand, both in stating relationships and in carrying out complicated arguments, as when we amalgamate several relationships.
We can say, for uniformly accelerated motion, &ldquo;the distance travelled is the sum of the product of initial velocity and time, and half the product of the acceleration and the square of the time,&rdquo; but it is shorter to say, &ldquo;<span class="math">s=v<sub>0</sub>t+&#189;at<sup>2</sup></span>&rdquo;.
If we tried to operate with wordy statements instead of algebra, we should still be able to start viath two accelerated-motion relations and extract a third one, as when we obtained <span class="math">v<sup>2</sup>= v<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>+2as</span> in Chapter 1, Appendix A; but, without the compact shorthand of algebra, it would be a brain-twister argument.
Going still further, into discussions where we use the razorsharp algebra called calculus, arguing in words would be impossibly complex and cumbersome.
In such cases mathematics is like a sausage-machine that operates with the rules of logical argument instead of wheels and pistons.
It takes in the scientific information we provide&mdash;facts and relationships from experiment, and schemes from our minds, dreamed up as guesses to be tried&mdash;and rehashes them into new form.
Like the real sausage-machine, it does not always deliver to the new sausage all the material fed in; but it never delivers anything that was not supplied to it originally.
It cannot manufacture science of the real world from its own machinations.

## Mathematics: the Good Servant

Yet in addition to routine services mathematics can indeed perform marvels for science.
As a lesser marvel, it can present the new sausage in a form that suggests further uses.
For example, suppose you had discovered that falling bodies have a constant acceleration of 32 ft/sec/sec, and that any downward motion they are given to start with is just added to the motion gained by acceleration.
Then the mathematical machine could take your experimental discovery and measurement of &ldquo;g&rdquo;&#39; and predict the relationship $s=v<sub>0</sub>t+\frac{1}{2}\left(32\right)t^2$.
Now suppose you had never thought of including upward-thrown things in your study, had never seen a ball rise and fall in a parabola.
The mathematical machine, not having been warned of any such restriction, would calmly offer its prediction as if unrestricted.
Thus you might try putting in an upward start, giving <span class="math">v<sub>0</sub></span> a negative value in the formula.
At once the formula tells a different-looking story.
In that case, it says,

<figure id="fig31-1">
\begin{equation*}
    s = v<sub>0</sub> t + \frac{1}{2} 32 t^2
\end{equation*}
<figcaption>
    Fig. 31-1.
</figcaption>
</figure>

the stone would fly up slower and slower, reach a highest point, and then fall faster and faster.
This is not a rash guess on the algebra&#39;s part.
It is an unemotional routine statement.
The algebra-machine&#39;s defense would be, &ldquo;You never told me <span class="math">v<sub>0</sub></span> had to be downward.
I do not know whether the new prediction is right.
All I can say is that IF <em>an upward throw follows the rules I was told to use for downward throws</em>, THEN <em>an upward throum hall will rise, stop, fall</em>.&rdquo;
It is we who make the rash guess that the basic rules may be general.
It is we who welcome the machine&#39;s new hint; but we then go out and try it.&#39;
To take another example from projectile mathematics, the following problem, which you met earlier, has two answers.



Problem:
&ldquo;A stone is thrown upward, with initial speed 64 ft/sec, at a bird in a tree.
How long after its start will the stone hit the bird, which is 48 feet above the thrower?&rdquo;

Answer:
1 second <em>or</em> 3 seconds.

<figure>
\label{fig:31-2}
\caption{Fig. 31-2.}
</figure>


This shows algebra as a very honest, if rather dumb, servant.
There are two answers and there should be, for the problem as presented to the machine.
The stone may hit the bird as it goes up (1 sec from start), or as it falls down again (after 3 sec).
The machine, if blamed for the second answer would complain, &ldquo;But you never told me the stone had to <em>hit</em> the bird, still less that it must hit it on the way <em>up</em>.
I only calculated <em>when the stone would be 48 feet above the thrower</em>.
There are two such times.&rdquo; Looking back, we see we neither wrote anything in the mathematics to express contact between stone and bird nor said which way the stone was to be moving.
It is our fault for giving incomplete instructions, and it is to the credit of the machine that it politely tells us all the answers which are possible within those instructions.


If the answer to some algebra problem on farming emerges as 3 cows or $2\frac{1}{4}$ cows, we rightly reject the second answer, but we blame ourselves for not telling the mathematical machine an important fact about cows.
In physics problems where several answers emerge we are usually unwise to throw some of them away.
They may all be quite true; or, if some are very queer, accepting them provisionally may lead to new knowledge.
If you look back at the projectile problem, \textnumero{}~<span class="math">7</span> in Chapter 1, Appendix B, you may now see what its second answer meant.
Here is one like it:

Problem:

A man throws a stone down a well which is 96 feet deep.
It starts with downward velocity 16 ft/sec.
When will it reach the bottom?

Fig. 31-4.

&#39; This is a simple example, chosen to use physics you are familiar with&mdash;unfortunately so simple that you know the answer before you let the machine suggest it.
There are many cases where the machine can produce suggestions that are quite unexpected and do indeed send us rushing to experiment.
E.g., mathematical treatment of the wave theory of light suggested that when light casts a sharp shadow of a disc there will be a tiny bright spot of light in the middle of the shadow on a wall: &ldquo;There is a hole in every coin.&rdquo;

Fic. 31-3.


Assign suitable $+$ and $-$ signs to the data, substitute them in a suitable relation for free fall, and solve the equation.
You will obtain two answers: One a sensible time with $+$ sign (the &ldquo;right&rdquo; answer), the other a negative time.
Is the negative answer necessarily meaningless and silly?
A time such as &ldquo;<span class="math">&minus;3</span> seconds&rdquo; simply means, &ldquo;3 seconds before the clock was started.&rdquo;
The algebra-machine is not told that the stone loas flung down by the man.
It is only told that when the clock started at zero the stone was moving <em>down</em> with speed 16 ft/sec, and thereafter fell freely.
For all the algebra knows, the stone may have just skimmed through the man&#39;s hand at time zero.
It may have been started much earlier by an assistant at the bottom of the well who hurled it upward fast enough to have just the right velocity at time zero.
So, while our story runs, &ldquo;George, standing at the top of the well, hurled the stone down &hellip; ,&rdquo; an answer <span class="math">&minus;3</span> seconds suggests an alternative story: &ldquo;Alfred, at the bottom of the well, hurled the stone up with great speed.
The stone rose up through the well and into the air above, with diminishing speed, reached a highest point, fell with increasing speed, moving down past George 3 seconds after Alfred threw it.
George missed it (at $t=0$), so it passed him at 16 ft/sec and fell on down the well again.&rdquo;
According to the algebra, the stone will reach the bottom of the well one second after it leaves George, and it might have started from the bottom 3 seconds before it passes George.
Return to Problem 7 of Chapter 1, Appendix B and try to interpret its two answers.

Problem 7:

A man standing on the top of a tower throws a stone up into the air with initial velocity 32 feet/sec up- ward.
The man&#39;s hand is 48 feet above the ground.
How long wall the stone take to reach the ground?


In these problems mathematics shows itself to be the completely honest servant&mdash;rather like the honest boy in one of G. K. Chesterton&#39;s &ldquo;Father Brown&rdquo; stories.
(There, a slow-witted village lad delivered a telegram to a miser.
The miser meant to tip the boy with the smallest English coin, a bright bronze farthing ($\frac{1}{3}$\textcent), but gave him a golden pound (\$3) by mistake.
What was the boy to do when he discovered the obvious mistake?
Keep the pound, trading on the mistake dishonestly?
Or bring it back with unctuous virtue and embarrass the miser into saying &ldquo;Keep it, my boy&rdquo;?
He did neither.
He simply brought the exact change, 19 shillings and $11\frac{3}{4}$ pence.
The miser was delighted, saying, &ldquo;At last I have found an honest man&rdquo;; and he bequeathed to the boy all the gold he possessed.
The boy, in wooden-headed honesty, interpreted the miser&#39;s will literally, even to the extent of taking gold fillings from his teeth.)

## Mathematics: the Clever Servant

As a greater marvel, mathematics can present the new sausage in a form that suggests entirely new viewpoints.
With vision of genius the scientist may see, in something new, a faint resemblance to something seen before&mdash;enough to suggest the next step in imaginative thinking and trial.
If we tried to do without mathematics we should lose more than a clear language, a shorthand script for argument and a powerful tool for reshaping information.
We should also lose an aid to scientific vision on a higher plane.


With mathematics, we can codify present science so clearly that it is easier to discover the essential simplicity many of us seek in science.
That is no crude simplicity such as finding all planetary orbits circles, but a sophisticated simplicity to be read only in the language of mathematics itself.
For example, imagine we make a hump in a taut rope by slapping it (Fig. 31-6).
Using Newton&#39;s Law II, we can codify the behavior of the hump in compact mathematical form.

<figure id="fig31-6">
<figcaption>
    Figure 31-6 Wave Travels Along a Rope}
</figcaption>
</figure>

There emerges, quite uninvited, the clear mathematical trademark of wave motion.
\footnote{The wave-equation reduces to the essential form: $\del^2 V = \left(\frac{1}{c^2}\right) \frac{d^2B}{dt^2}$
    For <em>any</em> wave of constant pattern that travels with speed c.
    (If you are familiar with calculus, ask a physicist to show you this remarkable piece of general mathematical physics.)
    This equation connects a spreading-in-space with a rate-of-change in time.
    $\del^2 V$ would be zero for an inverse-square field at rest in space: but here it has a value that looks like some acceleration.
    In the electromagnetic case, we may trace the $\frac{d^2V}{dt^2}$ back to an accelerating electron emitting the wave.
}
The mathematical form predicts that the hump will travel along as a wave, and tells us how to compute the wave&#39;s speed from the tension and mass of the rope.
Another example: A century ago, Maxwell reduced the experimental laws of electromagnetism to especially simple forms by boiling them down mathematically.
He removed the details of shape and size of apparatus, etc., much as we remove the shape and size of the sample when we calculate the density of a metal from some weighing and measuring.
Having thus removed the &ldquo;boundary conditions,&rdquo; he had electrical laws that are common to all apparatus and all circumstances, just as density is common to all samples of the same metal.
His rules were boiled down by the calculus-process of differentiation to a final form called differential equations.
You can inspect their form without understanding their terminology.
Suppose that at time <span class="math">t</span> there are fields due to electric charges and magnets, whether moving or not; an electric field of strength <span class="math">E</span>, a vector with components <span class="math">E_x</span>, <span class="math">E_y</span>, <span class="math">E_z</span>, and a magnetic field <span class="math">H</span> with components <span class="math">H_x</span>, <span class="math">H_y</span>, <span class="math">H_z</span>.
Then, in open space (air or vacuum), the experimental laws known a century ago reduce to the relations shown in Fig. \ref{fig:31-7}.

<figure id="fig31-7">
<figcaption>
    Maxwell&#39;s Equations (incomplete) The constant Ka relates to magnetic fields.
    It appears in the expression for the force exerted by a magnetic field on an electric current.
    (See the discussion in this chapter and in Ch. 37.)
    There is a corresponding electric constant, $K_{\epsilon}$, which appears in Coulomb&#39;s Law (See Ch. 33).
</figcaption>
</figure>

Look at IV and compare it with III.
The equations of IV look incomplete, spoiling the general symmetry.
\footnote{
    In completing IV, you will need to insert a constant $K_{\epsilon}$ corresponding to Kh in III.
    The minus sign is obviously unnecessary in the present form of IV, and when IV is completed it will spoil the symmetry somewhat; but the experimental facts produce it, conservation of energy requires it, and without it there would be no radio waves.
}
Maxwell saw the defect and filled it by inventing an extra electric current, a spookv one in space, quite unthought-of till then, but later ob served experimentally.
How would <em>you</em> change IV to match III if told that part of the algebra had been left out because it was then unknown? Try this.



The addition was neither a lucky guess nor a mysterious inspiration.
To Maxwell, fuUy aware of the state of developing knowledge, it seemed compulsory, a necessary extension of symmetry&mdash;that is the difference between the scientific advance of the disciphned, educated expert and the free invention of the enthusiastic amateur.


%% TODO: NOTE: start here
Having made his addition, fantastic at the time, Maxwell could pour the whole bunch of equations into the mathematical sausage-machine and grind out a surprising equation which had a familiar look, the same trademark of wave-motion that appears for a hump on a rope.
That new equation suggested strongly that changes of electric and magnetic fields would travel out as waves with speed $v=\frac{1}{\sqrt{K_HK_E}}$.
Here <span class="math">K_H</span> is a constant involved in the magnetic effects of moving charges; and <span class="math">K_E</span> is the corresponding electrostatic constant inserted by Maxwell in his improvement.
\footnote{
    In this course we use diflFerent symbols.
    See Ch. 33 and Ch. 37.
    We write the force between electric charges $F = B (Q<sub>1</sub> Q<sub>2</sub>)/d^2$.
    Comparison with Maxwell&#39;s form shows our <span class="math">B</span> is the same as $\frac{1}{Ke}$.
    Again, we write the force between two short pieces of current-carrying wire, due to magneticfield effects, $F = B&#39;(C, L,) (C, U)/d$; and our B&#39; is the same as Kb.
    Then Maxwell&#39;s prediction, u = 1 /\&#39;K» Ka , be-
comes, in our tenninoli)g\-. t&gt; = 1/\(1/B) (B&#39;) = \&#39;B/B&#39; .
So, if you measure B and B&#39; you can predict the speed of
electromagnetic waves. The arithmetic is easy. Try it and com-
pare the result with the measured speed of light, 3.0 X 10*
meters/sec. (B = 9.00 X 10* and B&#39; = 10 -^ in our units).
(<span class="math">K_E</span> is involved in the inverse-square force between electric charges.)


An informal fanciful derivation is sketched near the end of Chapter 37.


To Maxwell&#39;s delight and the wonder of his contemporaries, the calculated <span class="math">v</span> agreed with the speed of light, which was already known to consist of waves of some sort.
This suggested that light might be one form of Maxwell&#39;s predicted electromagnetic waves.


It was many years before Maxwell&#39;s prediction was verified directly by generating electromagnetic waves with electric ciurents.
As a brilliant intuitive guess, a piece of synthetic theory, Ma.xwell&#39;s work was one of the great developments of physics&mdash;its progeny, new guesses along equally fearless lines, are making the physics of today.


One of the great contributions of mathematics to
physics is Relativity, which is both mathematics and
physics: you need good knowledge of both mathe-
matics and physics to understand it. We shall give
an account of Einstein&#39;s &ldquo;Special Relativity&rdquo; and
then return to comments on mathematics as a
language.

Mathematics and Relativity



RELATIVITY

The theory of Relativity, which has modified our
mechanics and clarified scientific thinking, arose
from a simple question: &ldquo;How fast are we moving
through space?&rdquo; Attempts to answer that by experi-
ment led to a conflict that forced scientists to think
out their system of knowledge afresh. Out of that
reappraisal came Relativity, a brilliant apphcation
of mathematics and philosophy to our treatment of
space, time, and motion. Since Relativity is a piece
of mathematics, popular accounts that try to explain
it without mathematics are almost certain to fail.
To understand Relativity you should either follow
its algebra through in standard texts, or, as here,
examine the origins and final results, taking the
mathematical machine-work on trust.

What can we find out about space? Where is its
fixed framework and how fast are we moving
through it? Nowadays we find the Copernican view
comfortable, and picture the spinning Earth moving
around the Sun with an orbital speed of about 70,000
miles/hour. The whole Solar system is moving to-
wards the constellation Hercules at some 100,000
miles/hour, while our whole galaxy. . . .

We must be careering along a huge epicycloid
through space without knowing it. Without know-
ing it, because, as GaUleo pointed out, the mechan-
ics of motion — projectiles, collisions, . . . , etc. — is
the same in a steadily moving laboratory as in a
stationary one.* Galileo quoted thought-e.xperiments
of men walking across the cabin of a sailing ship
or dropping stones from the top of its mast. We il-
lustrated this &ldquo;Galilean relativity&rdquo; in Chapter 2 by
thought-experiments in moving trains. Suppose one
train is passing another at constant velocity without
bumps, and in a fog that conceals the countryside.
Can the passengers really say which is moving? Can
mechanical experiments in either train tell them?
They can onlv observe their relative motion. In fact,
we developed the rules of vectors and laws of mo-
tion in earthly labs that are moving; yet those state-
ments show no effect of that motion.

We give the name inertial frame to anv frame of
reference or laboratory in which Newton&#39;s Laws

* Though the Earth&#39;s velocity changes around its orbit, we
think of it as steady enough during any short experiment. In
fact, the steadiness is perfect, because any changes in the
Earth&#39;s velocity exactly compensate the effect of the Sun&#39;s
gravitation field that &ldquo;causes&rdquo; those changes. We see no
effect on the Earth as a whole, at its center; but we do see
differential effects on outlying parts — solar tides. The Earth&#39;s
rotation does produce effects that can be seen and measured
— Foucault&#39;s pendulum changes its line of swing, g shows
differences between equator and poles, &amp;c. — but we can
make allowances for these where they matter.



seem to describe nature truly: objects left alone
without force pursue straight lines with constant
speed, or stay at rest; forces produce proportional
accelerations. We find that any frame moving at
constant velocity relative to an inertial frame is also
an inertial frame — Newton&#39;s Laws hold there too.
In all the following discussion that concerns GaU-
lean relativity and Einstein&#39;s special Relativity, we
assume that every taborutory we discuss is an in-
ertial frame — as a laboratory at rest on Earth is, to
a close approximation.* In our later discussion of
General Relativity, we consider other laboratory
frames, such as those which accelerate.

We are not supplied by nature with an obvious
inertial frame. The spinning Earth is not a perfect
inertial frame (because its spin imposes central ac-
celerations), but if we could ever find one perfect
one then our relativity view of nature assures us we
could find any number of other inertial frames.
Every frame moving with constant velocity relative
to our first inertial frame proves to be an equally
good inertial frame — Newton&#39;s laws of motion,
which apply by definition in the original frame,
apply in all the others. When we do experiments on
force and motion and find that Newton&#39;s Laws seem
to hold, we are, from the point of view of Relativity,
simply showing that our earthly lab does provide
a practically perfect inertial frame. Any experiments
that demonstrate the Earth&#39;s rotation could be taken
instead as showing the imperfection of our choice of
frame. However, by saying &ldquo;the Earth is rotating&rdquo;
and blaming that, we are able to imagine a perfect
frame, in which Newton&#39;s Laws would hold exactly.

We incorporate Galilean Relativity in our formu-
las. When we write, s ^= vj -j- ^iat^ for a rocket ac-
celerating horizontally, we are saying, &ldquo;Start the
rocket with v^, and its efi^ect will persist as a plain
addition, vj, to the distance travelled.&rdquo;




Fic. 31-8.

This can be reworded: &ldquo;An experimenter e, starts a
rocket from rest and observes the motion: s = Hat^.
Then another experimenter, e&#39;, running away with
speed Va will measure distances-travelled given by
s&#39; = vj + l^t-. He will include Vgt due to his own
motion.&rdquo;

We are saying that the effects of steady motion



53



and accelerated motion do not disturb each other;
they just add.

e and C" have the following statements for the
distance the rocket travels in time t.

Ns&#39; r= Cot + &#39;Aat^



Both statements say that the rocket travels with
constant acceleration.&#39;

Both statements say the rocket is at distance zero

The first statement says e sees the rocket start
from rest. When the the clock starts at t = the
rocket has no velocity relative to him. At that instant,
the rocket is moving with his motion, if any — so he
sees it at rest — and he releases it to accelerate.

The difference between the two statements says
the relative velocity between e and e&#39; is t&gt;o. There
is no information about absolute motion, e may be
at rest, in which case e&#39; is running backward with
speed Vo- Or e&#39; may be at rest, and e running for-
ward Vo ( releasing the rocket as he runs, at t = ) .
Or both e and e&#39; may be carried along in a moving
train with terrific speed V, still with e moving ahead
vidth speed t&gt;o relative to e&#39;. In every case, v^ is the
relative velocity between the observers; and nothing
in the analysis of their measurements can tell us
(or them) who is &ldquo;really&rdquo; moving.

Observers in two laboratories, one moving with constant

velocity d relative to the other, will find the

same mechanical laws.

Yet we are still talking as if there is an absolute
motion, past absolute landmarks in space, however
hard to find. Before exploring that hope into greater
disappointments, v/e shall codify rules of relative
motion in simple algebraic form.

Galilean Transformation for Coordinates

We can put the comparison between two such
observers in a simple, general way. Suppose an ob-
server e records an event in his laboratory. Another

stant velocity and records the same event as he goes.
As sensible scientists, e and e&#39; manufactiu-e identical
clocks and meter-sticks to measure with. Each car-
ries a set of x-y-z-axes with him. For convenience,
they start their clocks (t = and f -— 0) at the
instant they are together. At that instant their co-
ordinate origins and axes coincide. Suppose £ re-
cords the event as happening at time t and place
{x, y, z) referred to his axes-at-rest-with-him.&#39; The
same event is recorded by observer e&#39; using his in-
struments as occurring at f and (x&#39;, y&#39;, z&#39;) referred
to the axes-he-carries-with-him. How will the bA&#39;o
records compare? Common sense tells us that time

is the same for both, so f&#39; = f. Suppose the relative
velocity between the two observers is t; meters/sec

&#39;For example: he files a bullet along OX from the origin
at t = with speed 1000 m./sec. Then the event of the
bullet reaching a target 3 meters away might be recorded
as X = 3 meters, y = 0,z = 0,t := 0.003 sec.



along OX. Measurements of y and z are the same
for both: y&#39; z= y and z&#39; = z. But since e&#39; and his
coordinate framework travel ahead of £ by vt meters
in t seconds, all his x&#39;-measurements will be vt
shorter. So every x&#39; must = x — vt. Therefore:

x&#39; z= X — vt v&#39; = y z&#39; ^ z f = t




X



Fig. 31-12C.

For measurements along direction of relative motion v,

the second observer measures x&#39;; the first measures x.

Then it seems obvious that x&#39; ■=. x — vt.

These relations, which connect the records made by
£&#39; and £, are called the Galilean Transformation.

The reverse transformation, connecting the rec-
ords of £ and £&#39;, is:

x = x&#39; -{-vt y = y&#39; z = z&#39; t = t&#39;

These two transformations treat the two observers
impartially, merely indicating their relative velocity,
-f- u for e&#39; — £ and — o for £ — e&#39;. They contain our
common-sense knowledge of space and time^ written
in algebra.

Velocity of Moving Object

If £ sees an object moving forward along the x
direction, he measures its velocity, u, by Ax/ At.
Then e&#39; sees that object moving with velocitv u&#39;
given by his Ax&#39;/Af. Simple algebra, using the
Gahlean Transformation, shows that t/ = u — v.
(To obtain this relation for motion with constant
velocity, just divide x&#39; = x — vthyt.) For example:
suppose £ stands beside a railroad and sees an
express train moving with u = 70 miles/hour. An-
other observer, e&#39;, rides a freight train moving 30
miles/hour in the same direction. Then e&#39; sees the
express moving with

«&#39; =r u — o = 70 — 30 = 40 miles/hour.

(If e&#39; is mo&#39;.ong the opposite way, as in a head-on
collision, t; = —30 miles/hour, and e&#39; sees the ex-
press approaching with speed

W = 70 — (-50) = 100 miles/hour.)

Each experimenter calculates the velocity of a moving

object from his observations of time taken and

distance travelled.




Fig. 31-14.

Stationary experimenter £ observes the velocities shown

and calculates the relative velocity that moving

experimenter e&#39; should observe.

This is the &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; way of adding and
subtracting velocities. It seems necessarily true, and
we have taken it for granted in earlier chapters. Yet
we shall find we must modify it for very high speeds.

PAbsolute Motion?

If we discover our laboratory is in a moving train,
we can add the train&#39;s velocity and refer our experi-
ments to the solid ground. Finding the Earth mov-
ing, we can shift our &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; axes of space to the Sun,
then to a star, then to the center of gravity of all
the stars. If these changes do not affect our knowl-
edge of mechanics, do they really matter? Is it
honest to worry about finding an absolutely fixed
framework? Curiosity makes us reply, &ldquo;Yes. If we
are moving through space it would be interesting
to know how fast.&rdquo; Though mechanical experiments
cannot tell us, could we not find out by electrical
experiments? Electromagnetism is summed up in
Maxwell&#39;s equations, for a stationary observer. Ask



what a moving observer should find, by changing
X to x&#39;, etc., with the Galilean Transformation: then
Maxwell&#39;s equations take on a different, more com-
plicated, form. An experimenter who trusted that
transformation could decide which is really moving,
himself or his apparatus: absolute motion would be
revealed by the changed form of electrical laws.
An easy way to look for such changes would
be to use the travelling electric and magnetic fields
of light waves — the electromagnetic waves pre-
dicted by Maxwell&#39;s equations. We might find our
velocity through space by timing flashes of light.
Seventy-five years ago such experiments were being
tried. When the experiments yielded an unexpected
result — failure to show any effect of motion — there
were many attempts to produce an explanation.
Fitzgerald in England suggested that whenever any
piece of matter is set in motion through space it
must contract, along the direction of motion, bv a
fraction that depended only on its speed. With the
fraction properly chosen, the contraction of the
apparatus used for timing light signals would pre-
vent their reveaUng motion through space. This
strange contraction, which would make even meas-
uring rods such as meter-sticks shrink hke everv-
thing else when in motion, was too surprising to be
welcome; and it came with no suggestion of mecha-
nism to produce it. Then the Dutch physicist Lo-
rentz (also Larmor in England) worked out a suc-
cessful electrical &ldquo;explanation.&rdquo;

The Lorentz Transfomuttion

Lorentz had been constructing an electrical theory
of matter, with atoms containing small electric
charges that could move and emit hght waves. The
experimental discover)&#39; of electron streams, soon
after, had supported his speculations; so it was
natural for Lorentz to try to explain the unex-
pected result with his electrical theory. He found
that if Maxwell&#39;s equations are not to be changed in
form by the motion of electrons and atoms of mov-
ing apparatus, then lengths along the motion must
shrink, in changing from x to x&#39;, by the modifying
factor:

1



V-(



SPEED OF OBSEHVER \ &#39;



SPEED OF LIGHT



;



He showed thai this shrinkage (the same as Fitz-
gerald&#39;s) of the apparatus would just conceal any
motion through absolute space and thus explain the
experimental result. But he also gave a reason for
the change: he showed how electrical forces — in the



56



Mathematics and Relativity



new form he took for Maxwell&#39;s equations — would
compel the shrinkage to take place.

It was uncomfortable to have to picture matter in
motion as invisibly shrunk — invisibly, because we
should shrink too — but that was no worse than the
previous discomfort that physicists with a sense of
mathematical form got from the uncouth effect of
the Galilean Transformation on Maxwell&#39;s equa-
tions. Lorentz&#39;s modifying factor has to be apphed
to f as well as i&#39;, and a strange extra term must be
added to f. And then Maxwell&#39;s equations maintain
their same simple symmetrical form for all observ-
ers moving with any constant velocity. You will see
this "Lorentz Transformation&rdquo; put to use in Rela-
tivity; but first see how the great experiments were
made with light signals.

Measuring Our Speed through &ldquo;Space&rdquo;?

A century ago, it was clear that light consists of
waves, which travel with very high speed through
glass, water, air, even &ldquo;empty space&rdquo; between the
stars and us. Scientists imagined space filled with
&ldquo;ether&rdquo; to carry light waves, much as air carries
sound waves. Nowadays we think of light (and all
other radio waves ) as a travelling pattern of electric
and magnetic fields and we need no &ldquo;ether&rdquo;; but before we reached that simple view a tremendous
contradiction was discovered.

Experiments with light to find how fast we are
moving through the &ldquo;ether&rdquo; gave a surprising result:
&ldquo;no comment.&rdquo; These attempts contrast with suc-
cessful measurements with sound waves and air.

Sound travels as a wave in air. A trumpet-toot is
handed on by air molecules at a definite speed
through the air, the same speed whether the trum-
pet is moving or not. But a moving observer finds
his motion added to the motion of sound waves.
When he is running towards the trumpet, the toot
passes by him faster. He can find how fast he is
moving through air by timing sound signals passing
him.

Experimenter running towards source of sound finds the

by his own speed.

^ This ether or a?ther was named after the universal sub-
stance that Greek philosophers had pictured filling all space
beyond the atmosphere.



A moving observer wiU notice another effect if
he is out to one side, listening with a direction-
finder. He will meet the sound slanting from a new

direction if he nms. Again he can estimate his run-
ning speed if he knows the speed of sound.

In either case, his measurements would tell him
his speed relative to the air. A steady wind blowing
would produce the same effects and save him the
trouble of running. Similar experiments with light
should reveal our speed relative to the &ldquo;ether,&rdquo;
which is our only remaining symbol of absolute
space. Such experiments were tried, with far-
reaching results.

Aberration of Starlight

Soon after Newton&#39;s death, the astronomer Brad-
ley discovered a tiny yearly to-and-fro motion of
all stars that is clearly due to the Earth&#39;s motion
around its orbit. Think of starhght as rain shower-
ing down (at great speed) from a star overhead. If
you stand in vertical rain holding an umbrella up-
right, the rain will hit the umbrella top at right
angles. Drops falling through a central gash will hit
your head. Now run quite fast. To you the rain will
seem slanting. To catch it squarely you must tilt
the umbrella at the angle shown by the vectors in the
sketch. Then drops falling through the gash will still
hit your head. If you run around in a circular orbit,
or to-and-fro along a line, you must wag the um-
brella this way and that to fit your motion. This is
what Bradley found when observing stars precisely
with a telescope." Stars near the ecliptic seemed to
slide to-and-fro, their directions swine;ing through
a small angle. Stars up near the pole of the ecliptic

&#39; This aberration is quite distinct from parallax, the ap-
parent motion of near stars against the background of re-
moter stars. Aberration makes a star seem to move in the
same kind of pattern, but it applies to all stars; and it is
dozens of times bigger than the parallax of even the nearest
stars. (Al.so, a star&#39;s aberration, which gins with thr F.artli&#39;s
velocity, is three months out of phase with its parallax. )

move in small circles in the course of a year. The
telescope following the star is like the tilting um-
brella. In six months, the Earth&#39;s velocity around
the Sun changes from one direction to the reverse,
so the telescope tilt must be reversed in that time.
From the tiny measured change in 6 months, Brad-
ley estimated the speed of light. It agreed with the
only other estimate then available — based on the
varying delays of seeing eclipses of Jupiter&#39;s moons,
at varying distances across the Earth&#39;s orbit.&#39;

Fig. 31-18. &ldquo;Aberration&rdquo; of Rain Falling in Wind
If you stand still but a steady wind carries the air
past you, you should still tilt the umbrella.

To catch rain drops fair and square, you must
tilt your umbrella if you are running or if there
is a steady wind, but not if you are running and
there is also a wind carrying the air and raindrops
along with you — if you just stand in a shower inside
a closed railroad coach speeding along, you do not
tilt the umbrella. Therefore, Bradley&#39;s successful
measurement of aberration showed that as the Earth
runs around its orbit it is moving through the &ldquo;ether&rdquo;
in changing directions, moving through space if you
like, nearly 20 miles/sec.

An overall motion of the solar system towards
some group of stars would remain concealed, since
that would give a permanent slant to star directions,

&#39; It was another century before terrestrial experiments

succeeded.

(~ 1600): Galileo recorded an attempt with experimenters
signalling by lantern flashes between two moun-
tain tops. E&#39; sent a flash to ej who immediately
returned a flash to Ei. At first ej was clumsy and
they obtained a medium speed for light. As they
improved with practice, the estimated speed
grew greater and greater, towards &ldquo;infinity&rdquo;&mdash;light travels too fast to clock by hand.

(~ 1700): Newton knew only Roemer&#39;s estimate from Jupi-
ter&#39;s moons.
(1849): Fizeau succeeded, by using a distant mirror to
return the light and a spinning toothed wheel as
a chopper to make the flashes and catch them
one tooth later on their return. His result con-
firmed the astronomical estimate. His and all
later terrestrial methods use some form of
chopper — as in some methods for the speeds of
bullets, and electrons.
Tlie result: speed of light is 300,000,000 meters/sec or

186,000 miles /sec.

The Michehon-Morley Experiment

Then, seventy-five years ago, new experiments
were devised to look for our absolute motion in
space. One of the most famous and decisive was
devised and carried out by A. A. Michelson and
E. W. Morley in Cleveland; this was one of the first
great scientific achievements in modem physics in
the New World. In their experiment, two flashes of
light travelling in different directions were made to
pace each other. There was no longer a moving
observer and fixed source, as with Bradley and a
star. Both source and observer were carried in a
laboratory, but the experimenters looked for motion
of the intervening ether that carried the light waves.

Fig. 31-20. The Michelson-Mobley Experiment

A semi-transparent mirror split the light into two
beams, one travelling, say, North-South and the
other East-West. The two beams were returned
along their paths by mirrors and rejoined to form an
interference pattern. The slightest change in trip-
time for one beam compared with the other would
shift the pattern. Now suppose at some season the
whole apparatus is moving upward in space: an
outside observer would see the light beams tilted up
or down by the &ldquo;ether-wind&rdquo; the same tilt for both
routes. At another season, suppose the whole Earth
is moving due North horizontally in space, then the
N-S light beam would take longer for its round trip
than the E-W one. You wiU find the experiments
described in standard texts, with the algebra to
show that if the whole laboratory is sweeping
through the ether, light must take longer on the
trip along the stream and back than on the trip
across and back.

You can see that this is so in the following ex-
ample. Instead of light, consider a bird flying across
a cage and back, when the cage is moving relative

an equal wind blow through it the opposite way.
We shall give the wind version; but you can re-tell
the story for a moving cage, with the same results.
Suppose the bird has air-speed 5 ft/sec, the cage is
40 ft square, and the wind blows through at 3 ft/sec.

ferent orientations, and returns of the tvdns will

air and how fast. A similar experiment with sound
waves in an open laboratory moving through air
would tell us the laboratory&#39;s velocity. Let a trum-
peter stand in one corner and give a toot. The ar-
rivals of returning echoes will reveal general motion,
of lab or wind. (Of course, if the moving laboratory

%% NOTE: check parenthesis in this paragraph
The corresponding test with light-signals is diflB-
cult, but the interference pattern affords a very deli-
cate test of trip-timing. When it was tried by Michel-
son and Morley, and repeated by Miller, it gave a
surprising answer: no motion through the &ldquo;ether.&rdquo;
It was repeated in different orientations, at different
seasons: always the same answer, no motion. If
you are a good scientist you will at once ask, &ldquo;How
big were the enor-boxes? How sensitive was the
experiment?&rdquo; The answer: &ldquo;It would have shown
reliably Vi of the Earth&#39;s orbital speed around the
Sun, and in later&rdquo; work, Vw. Yet aberration shows
us moving through the &ldquo;ether&rdquo; with ^%o of that
speed. Still more experiments added their testimony,
some optical, some electrical. Again and again, the
same &ldquo;null result.&rdquo; Here then was a confusing con-
tradiction:



formation, electrical experiments would show rela-
tive velocity (as they do), but would never reveal
uniform absolute motion. But then the Lorentz
Transformation made mechanics suffer; it twisted
F= Ma and 5 r= Uo + ^^t^ into unfamiliar forms
that contradicted Galileo&#39;s common-sense relativity
and Newton&#39;s simple law of motion.

Some modifications of the Michelson-Morley ex-
periment rule out the Fitzgerald contraction as a
sufiBcient &ldquo;explanation.&rdquo; For example, Kennedy and
Thomdike repeated it with unequal lengths for the
two perpendicular trips. Their null result requires
the Lorentz change of time-scale as well as the
shrinkage of length.

Pour these pieces of information into a good logic
machine. The machine puts out a clear, strong con-
clusion: &ldquo;Inconsistent.&rdquo; Here is a very disturbing
result. Before studying Einstein&#39;s solution of the
problem it posed, consider a useful fable.

CONTRADICTION

Growing electrical theory added confusion, be-
cause Maxwell&#39;s equations seemed to refer to
currents and fields in an absolute, fixed, space
(= ether). Unlike Newton&#39;s Laws of Motion, they
are changed by the Galilean Transforma&#39;tion to a
different form in a moving laboratory. However,
the modified transformation devised by Lorentz
kept the form of Maxwell&#39;s equations the same for
moving observers. This seemed to fit the facts — in
&ldquo;magnets and coils experiments&rdquo; (Experiment C in
Ch. 41 ), we get the same effects whether the magnet
moves or the coil does. With the Lorentz Trans-
it The latest test (Townes, 1958) made by timing micro-
waves in a resonant cavity, gave a null result when it would
have shown a velocity as small as 1/1000 of the Earth&#39;s
orbital speed.



A Fable

[This is an annoying, untrue, fable to warn you
of the diflBculty of accepting Relativity. Counting
items is an absolute process that no change of view-
point can alter, so this fable is very distressing to
good mathematical physicists with a strong sense of
nature — take it with a grain of tranquilizer. You will
find, however, that what it alleges so impossibly for
adding up balls does occur in relativistic adding of
velocities.]

I ask you to watch a magic trick. I take a black
cloth bag and convince you it is empty. I then put
into it 2 white balls. You count them as they go
in — one, two — and then two more — three, four.
Now I take out 5 white balls, and the bag is empty.

can you say now? If you cannot refute tried and
true observations, you must either give up science —
and go crazy — or attack the rules of logic, includ-
ing the basic rules of arithmetic. Short of neurotic
lunacy, you would have to say, &ldquo;In some cases,
2 + 2 do not make 4.&rdquo; Rather than take neurotic
refuge in a catch-phrase such as &ldquo;It all adds up to
anything,&rdquo; you might set yourself to cataloguing
events in which 2 and 2 make 4 — e.g. adding beans
on a table, coins in a purse; and cataloguing events
for which 2 + 2 make something else.^-

In studying Nature, scientists have been seeking and
selecting quantities that do add simply, such as masses of
Lquids rather than volumes, copper-plating by currents rather
than heating. The essence of the &ldquo;exceptions&rdquo; is that they are
cases where the items to be added interact; they do not just
act independently so that their efiFects can be superposed.



In this fable, you have three explanations to
choose from:

(a) &ldquo;It is witchcraft.&rdquo; That way madness lies.

(b) &ldquo;There is a special invisible mechanism&rdquo;: hardly any better&mdash;it turns science into a horde
of demons.

(c) &ldquo;The rules of arithmetic must be modified.&rdquo;

However unpleasant (c) looks, you had better
try it — desperate measures for desperate cases.
Think carefully what you would do, in this plight.

You are not faced with that arithmetical paradox
in real life, but now turn again to motion through
space. Ruling out mistaken experimenting, there
were similar choices: blame witchcraft, invent spe-
cial mechanisms, or modify the physical rules of
motion. At first, scientists invented mechanisms,
such as electrons that squash into ellipsoids when
moving, but even these led to more troubles.
Poincar^ and others prepared to change the rules for
measuring time and space. Then Einstein made
two brilliant suggestions: an honest viewpoint, and
a single hypothesis, in his Theory of Relativity.

The Relativitv viewpoint is this: scientific think-
ing should be built of things that can be observed
in real experiments; details and pictures that cannot
be observed must not be treated as real, questions
about such details are not only unanswerable, they
are improper and unscientific. On this view, fixed
space (and the &ldquo;ether&rdquo; thought to fill it) must be



62



Mathematics and Relativity



thrown out of our scientific thinking if we become
convinced that all experiments to detect it or to
measure motion through it are doomed to failure.
This viewpoint merely says, &ldquo;let&#39;s be realistic,&rdquo; on
a ruthless scale.

All attempts like the Michelson-Morley-Miller ex-
periment failed to show any change of light&#39;s speed.
Aberration measurements did not show light moving
with a new speed, but only gave a new direction to
its apparent velocity. So, the Relativity hypothesis
is this: The measured speed of light (electromag-
netic waves) will be the same, whatever the motion
of observer or source. This is quite contrary to com-



mon sense; we should expect to meet light faster or
slower by running against it or with it. Yet this is
a clear apphcation of the reahstic viewpoint to the
experimental fact that all experiments with light
fail to show the observer&#39;s motion or the motion of
any &ldquo;ether wind.&rdquo; Pour this hypothesis into the
logic machine that previously answered, &ldquo;Inconsistent&rdquo;; but remove the built-in &ldquo;geometry rules&rdquo; of
space-&amp;-time and motion, with their Galilean Trans-
formation. Ask instead for the (simplest) new rules
that uHll make a consistent scheme. However, since
Newtonian mechanics has stood the test of time,
in moving ships and trains, in the Solar System, etc..

perimenter past another, but we can never say which
is really moving.

Of course the new transformation accounts for
the Michelson-Morley-Miller null result — it was
chosen to do so. It also accounts for aberration, pre-
dicting the same aberration whether the star moves
or we do. But it modifies Newtonian mechanics. In
other words, we have a choice of troubles: the old
transformation upsets the form of electromagnetic
laws; the new transformation upsets the form of
mechanical laws. Over the full range of experiment,
high speeds as well as low, the old electromagnetic
laws seem to remain good simple descriptions of na-
ture; but the mechanical laws do fail, in their classi-
cal form, at high speeds. So we choose the new
transformation, and let it modify mechanical laws,
and are glad to find that the modified laws describe
nature excellently when mechanical experiments
are made with improved accuracy.

The new transformation looks unpleasant" be-
cause it is more complicated, and its implications are
less pleasant. To maintain his Galilean relativity,
Newton could assume that length, mass, and time are
independent of the observer and of each other. He



coidd assert that mechanical experiments will fail
to reveal uniform motion through &ldquo;space.&rdquo; When
Einstein extended the assertion of failure to experi-
ments with hght, he found it necessary to have
measurements of length and time, and therefore
mass, different for observers with different motions.
We shall not show the steps of the logic machine
grinding out the transformation and its implications,
but you may trust them as routine algebra.^&#39; We
shall follow custom and call it the Lorentz Trans-
formation.

Implications of the Lorentz Transformation

Take the new modified geometry that will fit the
experimental information, and argue from it how
measurements by different observers will compare.

formations e — » e&#39; and e&#39; -^ e are completely sym-
metrical, and show only the relative velocity t; — the
same in both cases — with no indication of absolute
motion, no hint as to which is "really moving."

The results of arguing from the transformation
differ strangely from earlier common sense, but only
at exceedingly high speeds. An observer flying past
a laboratory in a plane, or rocket, would apply
Galilean Transformations safely. He would agree
to the ordinary rules of vectors and motion, the
Newtonian laws of mechanics.
The speed of light, c, is huge:

c r= 300,000,000 meters/sec = 186,000 miles/sec
^ a billion ft/sec =« 700 million miles/hour
« 1 ft/nonasecond, in the latest terminology.

For relative motion with any ordinary velocity v,
the fraction v/c is tiny, uVc&#39; still smaller. The factor
Vl — V&#39;/c&#39;^ is 1 for all practical purposes, and
the time-lag xv/c&#39;^ is negligible — so we have the
Galilean Transformation.

Now suppose e&#39; moves at tremendous speed rela-
tive to e. Each in his own local lab will observe the
same mechanical laws; and any beam of light pass-
ing through both labs will show the same speed,
universal c, to each observer. But at speeds like
20,000 miles/sec, 40,000, 60,000 and up towards the
speed of light, experimenter e would see surprising
things as e&#39; and his lab whizz past, e would say,
"The silly fellow e&#39; is using inaccurate apparatus.

Each experimenter finds, by using his own standard

instruments, that the other experimenter is using

incorrect instruments: a shrunken meter stick, a

clock that runs too slowly, and a standard, mass

that is too big.



His meter stick is shrunken — less than my true
meter. His clock is running slow — taking more than
one of my true seconds for each tick." Meanwhile
e&#39; finds nothing wrong in his own laboratory, but
sees £ and his lab moving away backwards, and
says, "The silly fellow e ... his meter stick is
shrunken . . . clock running slow."

Suppose e measures and checks the apparatus
used by e&#39; just as they are passing, e finds the meter
stick that e&#39; holds as standard shrunk to \/l — v^/c^
meter, e finds the standard clock that e&#39; holds to tick
seconds is ticking longer periods, of l/\/l — v^/c^
second. And e finds the 1 kg standard mass that t
holds is greater, 1/Vl — v^c^ kg. These are
changes that a "stationary" observer sees in a mov-
ing laboratory; but, equally, a moving observer
watching a "stationary" laboratory sees the same
peculiarities: the stationary meter stick shorter,
clock running slower, and masses increased. The
Lorentz Transformations e&#39; — e and £ — e&#39; are sym-
metrical. If ^ and £ compare notes they will quarrel
hopelessly, since each imputes the same errors to
the other! Along the direction of relative motion,
each sees all the other&#39;s apparatus shrunk, even
electrons. Each sees all the other&#39;s clocks running
slowly, even the vibrations of atoms. (Across the
motion, in y- and z-directions, £ and £&#39; agree.) In
this symmetrical "relativity" we see the same thing
in the other fellow&#39;s laboratory, whether he is mov-
ing or we are. Only the relative motion between us
and apparatus matters— we are left without any hint
of being able to distinguish absolute motion through
space.

The shrinkage-factor and the slowing-factor are
the same, l/\/l — v-/c^. This factor is practically
1 for all ordinary values of v, the relative speed
between the two observers. Then the transformation
reduces to Gahlean form where geometry follows our
old "common sense." Watch a supersonic &#39;plane fly-
ing away from you 1800 miles/hour ( = ii mile/sec).
For that speed, the factor is



V / /2 mile/ sec V

~ \ 186,000 miles/sec/



or 1.000000000004



The plane&#39;s length would seem shrunk, and its clock
ticking slower, by less than half a billionth of 1%.
At 7,000,000 miles/hour (nearly 1/100 of c) the
factor rises to 1.00005. At 70,000,000 miles/hour it
is 1.005, making a 1-^% change in length.

Until this century, scientists never experimented
with speeds approaching the speed of light — except
for light itself, where the difference is paramount.

Chances of Measurement I*bedicted by Relativity

Nowadays we have protons hurled out from small
cyclotrons at 2/10 of c, making the factor 1.02;
electrons hitting an X-ray target at 6/10 of c, making
the factor 1.2; beta-rays flung from radioactive
atoms with 98/100 of c, making the factor 5; and
billion-volt electrons from giant accelerators, with
.99999988 c, factor 2000.

Among cosmic rays we find some very energetic
particles, mu-mesons; some with energy about 1000
million electron • volts moving with 199/200 of the
speed of light. For them
1/Vl - «Vc&#39; = l/Vl - 199V200&#39; = 1/ \/^= 10.



Now these mesons are known to be unstable, with
lifetime about 2 X 10"" sec (2 microseconds). Yet
they are manufactured by collisions high up in the
atmosphere and take about 20 X 10* seconds on the
trip down to us. It seemed puzzling that they could
last so long and reach us. Relativity removes the
puzzle: we are looking at the flying meson&#39;s internal
life-time-clock. To us that is slowed by a factor of
10. So the flying meson&#39;s lifetime should seem to us
20 X 10&#39; seconds. Or, from the meson&#39;s own point
of view, its lifetime is a normal 2 microseconds, but
the thickness of our atmosphere, which rushes past
it, is foreshortened to 1/10 of our estimate — so it
can make the shrunk trip in its short lifetime.

Measuring Rods and Clocks

We used to think of a measuring rod such as a
meter stick as an unchanging standard, that could
be moved about to step ofiE lengths, or pointed in
different directions, without any change of length.
True, this was an idealized meter stick that would
not warp with moisture or expand with some tem-
peratiure change, but we felt no less confident of its
properties. Its length was invariant. So was the time
between the ticks of a good clock. ( If we distrusted
pendulum-regulated clocks, we could look forward
to completely constant atomic clocks.) Now, Rela-
tivity warns us that measuring rods are not com-
pletely rigid with invariant length. The whole idea
of a rigid body — a harmless and useful idealization
to 19th-century physicists — now seems misleading.
And so does the idea of an absolutely constant
stream of time flowing independently of space. In-
stead, our measurements are affected by our motion,
and only the speed of light, c, is invariant. A broader
view treats c as merely a constant scale-factor for
our choice of units in a compound space-&amp;-time,
which different observers sHce differently.

Changes of Mass

If length- and time-measurements change, mass
must change too. We shall now find out how mass
must change, when a moving observer estimates it,
by following a thought-experiment along lines sug-
gested by "Tolman. We shall assume that the con-
servation of momentum holds true in any (inertial
frame) laboratory whatever its speed relative to the
observer — we must cling to some of our working
rules or we shall land in a confusion of unnecessary
changes.

Consider e and e&#39; in their labs, moving with rela-
tive velocity v in the x-direction. Suppose they make
two platinum blocks, each a standard kilogram,
that they know are identical — they can count the

atoms if necessary. Each places a 1-kg block at rest
in his lab on a frictionless table. Just as they are
passing each other e and e&#39; stretch a long light
.«:piral spring between their blocks, along the {/-direc-
tion. They let the spring tug for a short while and
then remove it, leaving each block with some y-
momentum. Then each experimenter measures the
y-velocity of his block and calculates its momentum.

Fig. 31-32. Two Observers Measuring Masses

( A thought-experiment to find how mass depends on speed of

object relative to observer.) £ says: 1 have 1 kg,

moving across my lab with velocity 3 meters/sec.

I know e&#39; has 1 kg, and I see that he records its

velocity as 3 meters/sec; but I know his clock is

ticking slowly, so that the velocity of his lump

is less than 3 meters/sec. Therefore his lump

has mass more than 1 kg.

They compare notes: each records 3 meters/sec for
his block in his own framework. They conclude:
equal and opposite velocities; equal and opposite
momenta. They are pleased to adopt Newton&#39;s Law
III as a workable rule. Then e, watching e&#39; at work,
sees that e&#39; uses a clock that runs slowly (but they
agree on normal meter sticks in the {/-directions). So
e sees that when e&#39; said he measured 3 meters travel
in 1 sec, it was "really" 3 meters in more-than-l-
second as e would measure it by his clock. There-
fore E computes that velocity as smaller than 3
meters/ second by \/l — v^/c^. Still believing in
Newton III and momentum-conservation, e con-
cludes that, since his own block acquired momentum
1 kg • 3 meters ^sec, the other, which he calculates
is moving slower must have greater mass&rdquo; — in-



creased by the factor l/\/i~— t^/P. While that
block is drifting across the table after the spring&#39;s
tug, e also sees it whizzing along in the x-direction,
table and all, with great speed v. Its owner, e&#39;, at
rest with the table, calls his block 1 kg. But e, who
sees it whizzing past, estimates its mass as greater, by

This result applies to all moving masses: mass, a?
we commonly know it, has different values for
different observers. Post an observer on a moving
body and he will find a standard value, the "rest-
mass," identical for every electron, the same for
every proton, standard for every pint of water, etc.
But an observer moving past the body, or seeing
it move past him, will find it has greater mass

makes practically no difference at ordinary speeds.
However, in a cyclotron, accelerated ions increase
their mass significantly. They take too long on their
wider trips, and arrive late unless special measures
are taken. Electrons from billion-volt accelerators
are so massive that they practically masquerade as
protons.

For example, an electron from a 2-million-volt
gun emerges with speed about 294,000,000 meters/
sec or 0.98 c. The factor l/\/l — (.98c)Vc&#39; is
l/Vl — (98/100)2 ^ l/\/47T00 = 5. To a sta-
tionary observer the electron has 5 times its rest-
mass." (Another way of putting this is: that elec-
tron&#39;s kinetic energy is 2 million electron • volts; the
energy associated with an electron&#39;s rest-mass is
half a million ev, and therefore this electron has
K.E. that has mass 4 rest-masses; and that with the
original rest-mass makes 5 rest-masses.)

This dependence on speed has been tested by
deflecting very fast electrons ( beta-rays ) with elec-
tric and magnetic fields, and the results agree ex-
cellently with the prediction. Another test: in a
cloud chamber a very fast electron hitting a sta-
tionary electron ("at rest" in some atom of the wet
air) does not make the expected 90° fork. In the
photograph of Fig. 31-34c, the measured angles

18 Suppose e and e&#39; are passing each other with relative
velocity 112,000 miles/sec. Then e sees the clock used by
e&#39; running slow, ticking once e\&#39;ery 1.2 seconds. So he knows
the block belonging to c&#39; has velocity 3 meters/ 1.2 sees or
2.5 meters/sec. His ovrt\ block has momentum 1 kg • 3 m./
sec. To preserve momentum conservation, he must say tliat
the other block has momentum 1.2 kg. • 2.5 m./scc. So he
estimates the mass of the other block as 1.2 kg, a 20S increase.

• To the moving electron, or to a neighbor flying along
beside it, its mass is the normal rest-mass; and it is the ex-
perimenter rushing towards it who has 5 times his normal
rest-mass and is squashed to &#39;5 his normal thickness.

agree well with those predicted by Relativity for a
moving mass 12.7m hitting a stationary mass m, in
an elastic collision. The tracks are curved be-
cause there was a strong magnetic field perpen-
dicular to the picture. Measurements of the curva-
tures give the momentum of each electron after
collision, and the momentum of the bombarding



electron before collision. Measurements of the
angles shown in the sketch confirm the proportions
of these momenta. If non-relativistic mechanics
[K.E. = Hmt;&#39;, etc.] is used to calculate the masses,
assuming an elastic collision, the projectile&#39;s mass
appears to be about four times the target particle&#39;s
mass. Yet the tracks look like those of an electron-

electron collision; and we do not expect 4m and m
classically for two electrons. So we try assuming
relativistic mechanics [K.E. = (m — m„)c^,

MOMENTUM = mv, with m = mj/Vl — v-/c&#39;] .

Then we find a consistent story: from the magnetic
field and our measurements of curvature we find:

BEFORE collision:

projectile had mass 12.7rMo, speed 0.9969 c;
Since the track is short and only slightly curved, its
radius cannot be measured very precisely; so the
projectile&#39;s momentum, and thence mass, is uncer-
tain within about 6%. We should say
mass = 12.7 mo ±: 6% or mass r= 12.7 mg ± 0.8 m„

AFTER COLLISION:

projectile had mass 8.9 m„, speed 0.9936 c;

target particle had mass 4.3 m„, speed 0.9728 c,
where tMo is the standard rest-mass of an electron
and c is the speed of light. Before collision the total
mass was 13.7 mo (including the target); after col-
lision it was 13.2 mo. Mass is conserved in this col-
lision — within the 6% experimental uncertainty —
and so is energy, now measured by mc^.

A Meaning for Mass Change

There is an easy physical interpretation of the
change of mass: the extra mass is the mass of the
body&#39;s kinetic energy. Try some algebra, using the
binomial theorem to express the V as a series,
for fairly low speeds:

= REST-MASS + MASS OF K.E.

Maximum Speed: c

As a body&#39;s speed grows nearer to the speed of
light, it becomes increasingly harder to accelerate —
the mass sweeps up towards infinite mass at the



69



speed of light. Experimenters using "linear accel-
erators" ( which drive electrons straight ahead ) find
that at high energies their victims approach the
speed of light but never exceed it. The electrons gain
more energy at each successive push ( and therefore
more mass ) but hardly move any faster ( and there-
fore the accelerating "pushers" can be spaced evenly
along the stream — a welcome simplification in de-
sign).

Mass growing towards infinity at the speed of
light means imaccelerability growing to infinity. Our
efForts at making an object move faster seem to nm
along the level of constant mass, till it reaches very
high speeds; then they climb a steeper and steeper
mountain towards an insurmountable wall at the
speed of light itself. No wonder Relativity predicts
that no piece of matter can move faster than light;
since in attempting to accelerate it to that speed we
should encounter more and more mass and thereby
obtain less and less response to our accelerating
force.

Adding Velocities, Relativistically

Faster than light? Surely that is possible: moimt
a gun on a rocket that travels with speed %c and
have the gun fire a bullet forward with muzzle
velocity ^. The bullet&#39;s speed should he &#39;¥ic -\- %c
or IViC. No: that is a Galilean addition of velocities.
We must find the relativistic rule.

Energy

We rebuild the Newtonian view of energy to fit
Relativity as follows. Define momentum as mv,
where m is the observed mass of the body in motion:
m = mo/Vl — v^/cr^. Define force, F, as A(inv)/At.
Define change from potential energy to K.E. as
WORK, F • As. Combine these to calculate the K.E.
of a mass m moving with speed v. We shall give the
result, omitting the calculus derivation.

We assign the body a permanent store of "rest-
energy" moC&#39;— locked up in its atomic force-fields,
perhaps. We add that to the K.E.; then the total en-
ergy, E, of the body is m^c^ ^ (mc^ — m^c^ ) = mc^.
Therefore total E = mc^. This applies whatever its
speed — but remember that m itself changes with
speed. At low speeds, mc&#39; reduces" to

(rest-energy m„c^) + (K.E. ^unv^).

For a short, direct derivation oi E = mc^, see the
note at the bottom of the next page.

This view that energy and mass go together ac-
cording to £ = mc^ has been given many successful
tests in nuclear physics. Again and again we find

nuclear break-up; but then we find a release of
energy — radiation in some cases, K.E. of flying frag-
ments in others — and that energy carries the miss-
ing mass.

The expression for mass, m = rrjo/Vl — v^/c&#39;
follows from the Lorentz Transformation and con-
servation of momentum. So E = mc^ follows from
Newton&#39;s Laws II and III combined with the Lo-
rentz Transformation.

Then if an observer assigns to a moving body a
mass m, momentum mv, and total energy mc^ he
finds that, in any closed system, mass is conserved,
momentum is conserved (as a vector sum), and
energy is conserved. In all this he must use the
observed mass m, which is m^/y/l — v^/c&#39;^ for any
body moving with speed v relative to him. Then
he is doubling up his claim of conservation because,
if the sum of all the masses (mj + m, -f- . . .), is
constant, the total energy (m^c^ + m^c^ + . . .)
must also be constant. If energy is conserved, mass
must also be conserved. One rule will cover both.
That is why some scientists say rather carelessly,
"mass and energy are the same, but for a factor c*."
In fact, since c^ is universally constant, there is little
harm in saying that mass and energy are the same
thing, though commonly measured in different units.
But there is also little harm if you prefer to think
of them still with quite different flavors as physical
concepts. And a very important distinction remains
between matter and radiation (and other forms of
energy). Matter comes in particles, whose total
number remains constant if we count the produc-
tion or destruction of a [particle -|- anti-particle]



pair as no change. Radiation comes in photons; and
the total number of photons does change when one
is emitted or absorbed by matter.

Covariance

Finally, Einstein treated momentum as a vector
with three components in space-&amp;-time, and kinetic J
energy with them as a fourth, time-Uke, component i
of a "supervector." Thus, conservation rules for
mass, momentum, and energy can be rolled into
one great formula in relativistic mechanics. The
Lorentz Transformation gives this formula the same
form with respect to any (steadily moving) set of
axes whatever their velocity. We say such a formula
or relation is "covariant." We put great store by
covariance: covariant laws have the most general
form possible and we feel they are the most perfect
mathematical statement of natural laws. "We lose
a frame of reference, but we gain a universally vaUd
symbolic form.""

"A Wrong Question"

The physical laws of mechanics and electromag-
netism are covariant: they give no hope of telling
how fast we move through absolute space. This
brings us back to Einstein&#39;s basic principle of being
realistic. Where the answer is "impossible," the
question is a foolish one. We are unscientific to
imply there is an absolute space, as we do when
we ask "How fast . . . through space?" We are
begging the question, inside our own question, bv
mentioning space. We are asking a wrong question,

" Frederic Keffer.



NOTE: Derivation of E = mc&#39;

This short derivation, due to Einstein, uses the experi-
mental knowledge that when radiation with energy E joulej
is absorbed by matter, it delivers momentum E/c kg-m./sf.c.
(Experiment shows that pressube of radiation on an absorb-
ing wall is ENEBCY-PER-UNiT-voLUME of radiation-beam.
Suppose a beam of area A falls on an absorbing surface
head-on. In time At, a length of beam c • M arrives. Then

This also follows from Maxwell&#39;s equations).

We take two views of the same thought-experiment:



(A) Place a block of matter at rest on a frictionless table.
Give it some energy £ by firing two chunks of radiation at
it, /i£ from due East, )iE from due West. The block absorbs
the radiation and gains energy E; but its net gain of mo-
mentum is zero: it stays at rest. (B) Now let a running
observer watch the same event. He runs with speed t&gt; due
North; but according to Relativity he can equally well think
he is at rest and see the table, etc. moving towards him
with speed v due South. Then he sees the block moNing
South with momentum .\/i;. He sees the two chunks of radia-
tion moving towards the block, each with speed c but in
directions, slanted southward with slope v/c. ( This is like
the aberration of starlight. ) In his view, each chunk
has momentum (Vi£/c) with a southward component
(V^£/c) (u/c). Thinking himself at rest, he sees total south-
ward momentum Mv + 2( V&amp;£/c) (c/c). After the block
has absorbed the radiation, he still sees it moving South
with the same speed v — since in version (A) we saw that
the block gained no net momentum. However, the block
may gain some mass, say m. Find out how big m is by
trusting conservation of momentum:

Mv + 2(^E/c)(«/c) = (M -t- m)v
m = E/c&#39; or £ = mc",

where m is the mass gained when energy £ is gained.

like the lawyer who says, "Answer me &#39;yes&#39; or &#39;no.&#39;
Have you stopped beating your wife?" The answer
to that is, "A reasonable man does not answer un-
reasonable questions." And Einstein might suggest
that a reasonable scientist does not ask unreasonable
questions.

Simultaneity

The observers e and e&#39; do not merely see each
other&#39;s clocks running slowly; worse still, clocks at
different distances seem to disagree. Suppose each
observer posts a series of clocks along the x-direc-
tion in his laboratory and sets them all going to-
gether. And when e and e&#39; pass each other at the
origin, they set their central clocks in agreement.
Then each will blame the other, saying: "His clocks
are not even synchronized. He has set his distant
clocks wrong by liis own central clock — the greater
the distance, the worse his mistake. The farther I
look down his corridor, along the direction he is
moving, the more he has set his clocks there back —
they read early, behind my proper time. And look-
ing back along his corridor, opposite to the direc-
tion of his motion, I see his clocks set more and
more forward, to read later than my correct time."
(That judgment, which each makes of the other&#39;s
clocks, is not the result of forgetting the time-delay
of seeing a clock that is far away. Each observer
allows for such delays — or reads one of his own
clocks that is close beside the other&#39;s — and then
finds the disagreement. This disagreement about
setting of remote clocks belongs with the view that
each observer takes of clock rates. Each claims that
all the other&#39;s clocks are running too slowly; so they
should not be surprised to find that their central
clocks, originally synchronized at the origin, dis-
agree after a while. Each says: "His central clock,
that was opposite me, has moved ahead and was
running too slowlv all the while; so no wonder its
hands have not moved around as fast as my clock." )

e observes his own row of clocks ticking simul-
taneously all in agreement. But e&#39; does not find those
ticks simultaneous. Events that are simultaneous
for e are not simultaneous for e&#39;. This is a serious
change from our common-sense view of universal
time; but it is a part of the Lorentz Transformation.
In fact, the question of simultaneity played an es-
sential role in the development of relativitv bv
Poincare and Einstein. Arguing with thought-ex-
periments that keep "c" constant, you can show this
change is necessary. The following example il-
lustrates this.

Suppose E and e&#39; have their laboratories in two
transparent railroad coaches on parallel tracks, one
moving with speed v relative to the other. Just

Each experimenter sets his own clocks all in agreement
( allowing carefully for the time taken by any light
signals he uses in looking at them). Each experimenter
finds that the other man&#39;s clocks disagree among
themselves, progressively with distance. ( That is, after
he has allowed carefully for the time taken by the light
signals he uses in checking the other man&#39;s clocks
against his own. ) The sketch shows a series of clocks
all fixed in the framework belonging to £. As adjusted
and observed by e, they all agree: they are synchro-
nized. As investigated by e&#39; those clocks disagree with
each other. The lower sketch shows what e&#39; finds by
comparing those clocks simultaneously ( as he, e&#39;,
thinks) with his own clock. The two sketches of clocks
disagree because each experimenter thinks he com-
pares them all simultaneously but disagrees with the
other man&#39;s idea of simultaneity.

as the coaches are passing, e and e&#39; lean out of their
center windows and shake hands. They happen to
be electrically charged, + and — , so there is a flash
of light as they touch. Now consider the light from
this flash. Some of it travels in each coach starting
from the mid-point where the experimenter is
standing, e finds it reaches the front and hind ends
of his coach simultaneously. And e&#39; finds it reaches
the ends of his coach simultaneously. Each con-
siders he is in a stationary coach with light travelling
out from the center with constant speed c. But e
can also observe the light flash reaching the ends
of the other coach that carries z&#39;. He observes the
events that e&#39; observes; but he certainly does not
find them simultaneous, as e&#39; claims. Bv the time



73



the flash has travelled a half-length of the e&#39; coach,
that coach has moved forward past e. As e sees it,
the light travels farther to reach the front end of
that moving coach, and less to the hind end. So e
sees the flash hit the hind end first, v^&#39;hile e&#39; claims
the hits are simultaneous." (Reciprocally, e&#39; sees
the light reach the ends of the coach carrying e at
different instants, while e claims they are simul-
taneous.) You will meet no such confusion in ordi-
nary life, because such disagreements over priority
arise only when the events are very close in time,
or very far apart in distance. Where events P and
Q are closer in time than the travel-time for light
between them, observers with different motions may
take different views: one may find P and Q simul-
taneous, while another finds P occurs before Q, and

To show that events that are simultaneous for one observer

are not simultaneous for an observer moving with a

different velocity.



still another finds P later than Q. To maintain Ein-
stein&#39;s Relativity, we must regard time as interlocked
with space in a compound space-time, whose slicing
into separate time and space depends somewhat on
the observer&#39;s motion. If we accept this compound
space-time system, we must modify our philosophy
of cause and effect.

Cause and Effect

Earher science was much concerned with cau-
sality. Greeks looked for "first causes"; later scien-
tists looked for immediate causes — "the heating
caused the rock to melt"; "the pressure caused the
hquid to flow"; "the alpha-particle caused the ions
to be formed." It is diflBcult to define cause and
effect. "P causes Q": what does that mean? The
best we can say is that cause is something that pre-
cedes the effect so consistently that we tliink there is
a connection between them.

Even in common cases ( like stress and strain or
P.O. and current), we prefer to say P and Q go to-
gether: we still look for relationships to codify our
knowledge, but we treat P and Q as cousins rather
than as parent and child.

And now Relativity tells us that some events can
show a different order in time for different observ-
ers — and all observers are equally "right." The
sketches of Fig. 31-40(e), below, show how various
observers at an event P, here-new, must classify
some other events (e.g., Q, ) as in the absolute
future; some other events ( e.g., Q, ) in the absolute
past; and some events (e.g., Q., ) in the absolute
elsewhere (as Eddington named it) where observ-
ers with different motions at P may disagree over
the order of events P and Q.

^&#39; Note that the disagreement over simultaneity is not due
to forgetting the time taken by light signals to bring the in-
formation to either observer. We treat the problem as if each
observer had a whole gang of perfectly trained clockwatchers
ranged along his coach to make observations without signal
delays and then report at leisure. The observers compare
notes (e.g. by radio). Then each has an obvious explanation
of the other man&#39;s claim that he saw the light flash reach the
ends of his own coach simultaneously: "Why, the silly fellow
has set his clocks askew. He has a clock at each end of his
coach, and when the light flash hit those end clocks they
both showed the same instant of time — I saw that, too. But
he is wrong in saying his end clocks are set in agreement:
I can see that he has set his front-end clock back by my
standard, and his hind-end clock ahead. / can see that
the flash had to travel farther to reach his front end. And
my clocks tell me it arrived there later, as I know it should.
But since his clock is mis-set, early by mine, the late-
ness of arrival did not show on it. Those mistakes of his
in setting his clocks just cover up the difference of transit-
time for what I can see are different travel-distances to the
ends of his coach." As in all such relativistic compariscns,
each observer blames the other for making exactly the same
kind of mistake.

(These fanciful sketches are highly restricted: all the events
shown occur in one straight Une, in a one-dimensional space,
along an i-axis.

In the Lorentz picture, a very high relative velocity between
e and e&#39; is assumed. The distortion of the i&#39; and f system in
the Lorentz picture shows the view taken by £. Of course, e&#39;
himself would take an "undistorted" view of his own system,
but e&#39; would find the x and ( system "distorted."

It is not possible to show the essential symmetry here; so the
Lorentz picture should only be taken as a suggestion: taken
literally, it would be misleading. )

(a) An event that occurs on the straight hne (x-axis) is
shown by a point on this chart. Distance along shows where
the event occurs on the line. Distance up shows when it
occurs. Event P precedes event Q in time. It may be sensi-
ble to say that P causes Q, for some types of event.



(b) A moving experimenter carries his origin for distance
with him. On the Galilean system he uses the same time-
scale as a stationary experimenter.

(c) With a Galilean transformation between two experi-
menters, the lines for each hour by the clock are the same
for both observers, and parallel to the axis, ( = 0.

(d) The Lorentz transformation between two experimenters
tilts one coordinate system of space-&amp;-time relative to the
other (through a negligible angle, except when speed of
e&#39; relative to £ approaches c).

Then an event Q that follows event P in time for one ex-
perimenter may precede P for another — but only if the
events are so far apart that a light signal from one event
could not travel to the place of the otfier event and reach
it before the other event occurred there.

x&#39;-axis. The hnes continuing seen-now in the forward direc-
tion of time mark the maximum tilt that e&#39; could have for

greater than c; so his x&#39;-axis can never tilt as much as those

"hght-lines" which have slope c. Rotate the picture around
tlie t-axis and the light-lines make a double cone. Suppose
an event P occurs at the origin, here-now, and another
event at Q. If Q is within the upper light-cone ( Qi ) , it is
definitely in the future of P for all observers. Similarly, all
events in the lower Ught-cone (Qj) are in the absolute past,
earlier than P for all observers. But Q» in the space between
the cones may be in the future for e and yet be in the past
for an observer e&#39; whose x&#39;-axis tilts above it. So we label
that intermediate region absolute elsewhere. If Q falls
tht.°, neither P rwr Q cari cause the other — they simply
occur at different places.



So now we must be more careful. We may keep
cause and eflFect in simple cases such as apples and
stomach-ache, or alpha-particles and ions; but we
must be wary with events so close in time, for their
distance apart, that they fall in each other&#39;s abso-
lute ELSEWHERE.

In atomic physics you will meet other doubts con-
cerning cause and efiFect. Radioactive changes ap-
pear to be a matter of pure chance — the future life-
time of an individual atom being unpredictable. In
the final chapter you will see that nature enforces
partial unpredictability on all our knowledge, hedg-
ing individual atomic events with some unavoidable
uncertainty, making it unwise to insist on exact
"eflFects" from exact "causes."

The Lorentz Transformation as a Rotation

The sketches of Fig. 31-40 suggest we can throw light
on the Lorentz transformation if we look at the effect
of a simple rotation of the axes of a common x-, t/-graph.
Try the algebra, and find the "transformation" connect-
ing the old coordinates of a point, x, y, with the new
coordinates, x&#39;, tf of the same point, thus:



&#39;


T




K


1
1
J






X


X




Refer a point in a plane to i-(/-axes. Then rotate the
axes through an angle A (around the z-axis). The point,
remaining at its old position in space, has coordinates
x&#39;, y&#39; referred to the new axes. Use the svmbol s for the
slope of the new x-axis, so that s is tan A. Then, as the
diagram shows



x&#39; = (x + b) cos A = (x + y tan A) cos A
= (i + sy)/sec A = {x + sy)/\/(l -h tan^A)
.-. X&#39; = (x-|-«/)/V(l + s&#39;)
Similarly, y&#39; = (y — sx)/\/{l + s-)

This transformation for a simple rotation of axes shows
a square root playing much the same role as in the
Lorentz transformation. In fact we obtain the Lorentz
form if we replace i/ by a time coordinate, thus: instead
of y, use t multiplied by constant c and by « the square
root of (—1). And instead of slope s use i{v&#39;c). Then,
with y — ict and y&#39; = ict&#39; and 5 = iv/c, the simple
rotation-transformation is the Lorentz transformation.
Try that. That shows how the Lorentz transformation
can be regarded as a sUcing of space-&amp;-time with a dif-
ferent slant for different observers.

The Invariant "IntervaT&#39; between Two Events

We can define the "interval" R between two events
(i,, tj) and (Xj, t.^) by the Pythagorean form

R» = (x, -X.J&#39; + (icf, - ict^)&#39;

Then we can also write the expression that gives R&#39;, the
"interval" for another observer who records the same
two events at (x/, t/) and (x^&#39;, t^) on his coordinates.
If we then use the Lorentz transformabon to express R&#39;
in terms of the first observer&#39;s coordinates, we find that
R&#39; is the same as R. The Lorentz transformation keeps
that "interval" invariant. That states the Relativitv&#39; as-
sumption — measured c is always the same — in a dif-
ferent way.

John A. Wheeler suggests a fable to illustrate the role
of c. Suppose the inhabitants of an island do their
surveying with rectangular coordinates, but measure
North-South distances in miles and East-West ones in
feet. Then a sudden, permanent shift of magnetic North
through an angle A makes them turn their system of
axes to the new direction. Thev again measure in miles
along the new N&#39;-S&#39; direction, and in feet E&#39;-W. They
trv to compute the distance R between two points by
Pythagoras: R&#39; = (Ax)» -I- (Ai/)&#39;; and they find that
R takes a different value with the new coordinates.



76



Mathematics and Relativity



Then they find that they obtain the same value for R
(and a useful one) with both sets of coordinates if they
define R by: R^ = (Ax)^ + (5280ai/)2.

Their "mysterious essential factor," 5280, corresponds
to c in the relativistic "interval" in the paragraph above.
Moral: c is not so much a mysterious limiting velocity
as a unit-changing factor, which suggests that time and
space are not utterly different: they form one con-
tinuum, with both of them measurable in meters.

Is There a Framework of Fixed Space?

Thus we have devised, in special Relativity, a new
geometry and physics of space-&amp;-time with our
clocks and measuring scales (basic instruments of
physics), conspiring, by their changes when we
change observers, to present us wath a universally
constant velocity of light, to limit all moving matter
to lesser speeds, to reveal physical laws in the same
form for all observers moving with constant veloc-
ities; and thus to conceal from us forever any abso-
lute motion through a fixed framework of space; in
fact, to render meaningless the question whether
such a framework exists.

HIGHER VALUES OF MATHEMATICS
AS A LANGUAGE

Mathematical Form and Beauty

As a language, algebra may be very truthful or
accurate, and even fruitful, but is it not doomed to
remain dull, uninteresting prose and never rise to
poetry? Most mathematicians will deny that doubt
and claim there is a great beauty in mathematics.
One can learn to enjoy its form and elegance as
much as those of poetry. As an example, watch a
pair of simultaneous equations being polished up
into elegance. Start with

2x -f 3t/ = 9
4x — 2y =: 10.

Then with some juggling we can get rid of y and
find X == 3; and then «/ ^ 1. But these are lopsided,
individual equations. Let us make them more gen-
eral, replacing the coeflBcients, 2, 3, 9, etc., by letters
a, b, c, etc., thus



ax -|- bt/ = c



After heavier juggling we find x



dx -f- ey = f
;c — fb



ae — db

more juggling is needed to find y. These solutions
enable us to solve the earlier equations and others
like them by substituting the number coefficients
for a, b, c, etc. But unless we had many equations
to solve that would hardly pay; and we seem no
nearer to poetry. But now let us be more system-
atic. We are dealing with x and y as much the
same things; so we might emphasize the similarity



by calling them x, and Xj. To match that change,
we use aj, a^, ao instead of a, b, c and vvaite:
a^Xj + ^2*2 = ^0- But then we have the second
equation&#39;s coeflBcients. We might call them a/, etc.,
but even so the two equations do not look quite
symmetrical. To be fairer still, we call the first lot
a/ etc. and the second lot a/&#39; etc. Then:

^1 ^1 ~r ^2 ^2 ^ ^0

and a/&#39;Xi -f a/&#39;x^ = a."
These look neat, but is their neatness much use?



Solve for x. We obtain x^ =



an a, — a^



Here



is a gain: we need not solve for Xj or y. Symmetry
will show us the answer straight away. Note that x^
and Xj (the old x and y) and their coeflBcients are
only distinguished by the subscripts i and j- If we
interchange the subscripts ^ and ^ throughout, we
get the same equations again, and therefore we must
have the same solutions. We make that interchange



in the solution above and x^ =



be-



^i ^-



—. Now we have the an-



swer for Xj (the old y), free of charge. The economy
of working may seem small; but think of the in-
creased complexity if we had, say, five unknowns
and five simultaneous equations. With this sym-
metrical system of writing, we just solve for one
unknown, and then write down the other four solu-
tions by symmetry. Here is form playing a part
that is useful for economy and pleasant in appear-
ance to the mathematical eye. More than that, the
new form of equations and answers is general and
universal — in a sense this is a case of covariance.
This is the kind of symmetrical form that appealed
to Maxwell and Einstein.

This is only a little way towards finding poetry
in the language of mathematics — about i&gt;.s far as
well-metered verse. The next stage would be to use
symmetrical methods rather than symmetrical forms,
e.g. "determinants." As the professional mathema-

Geometry and Science: Truth and General Relatimty

Thus, mathematics goes far beyond working
arithmetic and sausage-grinding algebra. It even
abandons pert definitions and some of the restric-
tions of logic, to encourage full flowering of its
growth; but yet its whole scheme is based on its
own starting points; the views its founders take of

numbers, points, parallel lines, vectors, .... Pure
mathematics is an ivory-tower science. The results,
being derived by good logic, are automatically true
to the original assumptions and definitions. Whether
the real world fits the assumptions seems at first a
matter for experiment. We certainly must not trust
the assumptions just because they seem reasonable
and obvious. However, they may be more like defini-
tions of procedure, in which case mathematics, still
true to those definitions, might interpret any world
in terms of them.

We used to think that when the mathematician
had developed his world of space and numbers, we
then had to do experiments to find out whether the
real world agrees with him. For example, EucHd
made assumptions regarding points and lines, etc.
and proved, or argued out, a consistent geometry.
On the face of it, by rough comparison with real
circles and triangles drawn on paper or surveyed
on land, the results of his system seemed true to
nature. But, one felt, more and more precise experi-
ments were needed to test whether Euclid had
chosen the right assumptions to imitate nature
exactly; whether, for example, the three angles of a
triangle do make just 180 degrees. ^° Relativity-
mechanics and astronomical thinking about the uni-
verse have raised serious questions about the most
fitting choice of geometry. Mathematicians have
long known that Euclid&#39;s version is only one of
several devisable geometries which agree on a
small scale but diflFer radically on a large scale in
their physical and philosophical nature.

Special Relativity deals with cases where an ob-
server is moving with constant velocity relative to
apparatus or to another observer. Einstein then de-
veloped General Relativity to deal with measure-
ment in systems that are accelerating.

What is General Relativity, and how does it affect
our views of physics — and of geometry?

*o It probably seems obvious to you that they do. This may
be because you have swallowed Euclid&#39;s proof whole — au-
thoritarian deduction. Or you may have assured yourself in-
ductively by making a paper triangle, tearing off the corners
and assembling them. Suppose, however, we lived on a huge
globe, without knowing it. Small triangles, confined to the
schoolroom would have a 180° sum. But a huge triangle
would have a bigger sum. For example, one with a 90° apex
at the N-pole would have right angles at its base on the
equator.

Einstein&#39;s Principle of Equivalence

Einstein was led to General Relativity by a single
question: "Could an observer in a falling elevator
or accelerating train really know he is accelerating?"
Of course he would notice strange forces ( as in the
case of truck-and-track experiments to test F = Ma
in an accelerating railroad coach.&#39; There strange
forces act on the truck and make F = Ma untrue).
But could he decide by experiment between ac-
celeration of his frame of reference and a new gravi-
tational field? (If a carpenter builds a correctly
tilted laboratory in the accelerating coach, the ob-
server will again find F =. Ma holds, but he will
find "g" different.)" Therefore, Einstein assumed
that no local experiments — mechanical, electrical or
optical — could decide: no experiments could tell an
observer whether the forces he finds are due to his
acceleration or to a local "gravitational" field. Then,
Einstein said, the laws of physics must take the same
essential form for ALL observers, even those who
are accelerating. In other words, Einstein required
all the laws of physics to be covariant for all trans-
formations from one frame of reference (or labora-
tory) to another. That is the essential basis of Gen-
eral Relativity: all physical laws to keep the same
form.

It was obvious long ago that for mechanical be-
havior a gravitational field and an accelerating
frame of reference are equivalent. Einstein&#39;s great
contribution was his assumption that they are com-
pletely equivalent, that even in optical and electrical
experiments a gravitational field would have the
same effect as an accelerated frame of reference.
"This assertion supplied the long-sought-for link
between gravitation and the rest of physics. . . ."-&#39;

Accelerating Local Observer ^ "Gravitational Field"

The Principle of Equivalence influences our view
of matter motion and geometry in several ways:

(1) Local Physics for Accelerated Observers. If
the Principle of Equivalence is true, all the strange
effects observed in an accelerating laboratory can
be ascribed to an extra force-field. If the labora-
tory&#39;s acceleration is a meters &#39;sec&#39;, we may treat the
laboratory as at rest instead if we give every mass
m kg an extra force —ma newtons, presumably due
to a force-field of strength — a newtons kg. Then,
with this field included, the ordinary rules of
mechanics should apply — or rather the Lorentz
modification of Newtonian mechanics and Euclid-
ean geometry, just as in Special Relativity.

Mathematics and Relativity



Examples:

(i) Experimenters in a railroad coach that is ac-
celerating — or in a rocket that is being driven
by its fuel — will find Newton&#39;s Laws of motion
applying at low speeds, provided they add to
all visible forces on each mass m the extra
(backward) force, —ma, due to the equivalent
force-field.^^ Objects moving through the labo-
ratory at very high speeds would seem to have
increased mass, etc., just as we always expect
from Special Relativity.

(ii) An experimenter weighing himself on a spring
scale in an elevator moving with downward
acceleration a would obtain the scale reading
that he would expect in a gravitational field
of strength (g — a). (See Ch. 7, Problem 10.)

(iii) In a freely falling box the force exerted by the
equivalent force-field on a mass m would be
mg upward. Since this would exactly balance
the weight of the body, mg downward, every-
thing would appear to be weightless. The
same applies to experiments inside a rocket
when its fuel has stopped driving it, or to ex-
periments on any satellite pursuing an orbit
around the Earth: the pull of the Earth&#39;s con-
trolling gravity is not felt, because the whole
laboratory is accelerating too.

(iv) In a rotating laboratory, adding an outward
force-field of strength v-/R would reduce the
local mechanical behavior to that of a sta-
tionary lab.

( 2 ) Interpreting Gravity. All ( real ) gravitational
fields can be reinterpreted as local modifications of
space-&amp;-time by changing to appropriate accelerat-
ing axes so that the field disappears. This change
gives us no help in mechanical calculations, but it
leads to a new meaning for gravity, to be discussed
in the next section.

(3) "Removing Gravity." If a gravitational field
is reallv equivalent to an accelerating frame, we can
remove it by giving our laboratory an appropriate
acceleration. Common gravity, the pull of the Earth,
pulls vertically down. It is equivalent to an accelera-

-&#39; Over 200 years ago, the French philosopher and mathe-
matician d&#39;Alembert stated a general principle for solving
problems that involve accelerated motion: add to all the
known forces acting on an accelerating mass m an extra
force —ma; then treat m as in equilibrium. By adding such
"d&#39;Alembert forces" to all the bodies of a complex system
of masses in motion we can convert the dynamical problem
of predicting forces or motion into a statical problem of
forces in equilibrium. This is now common practice among
professional physicists, but it is an artificial, sophisticated
notion that is apt to Ije misleading; so we avoid it in ele-
mentary teaching. It is the basis of the "engineer&#39;s headache-
cure" mentioned in Opinion III of centrifugal force, in
Chapter 21.



tion of our frame, g vertically up. If we then let
our lab fall through our frame of reference with
acceleration g vertically down, we observe no effects
of gravity. Our lab has two accelerations, the "real"
one of falling and the opposite one that replaces the
gravitational field. The two just cancel and we have
the equivalent of a stationary lab in zero gravita-
tional field. That just means, "let the lab fall freely,
and gravity is not felt in it." We do that physically
when we travel in a space ship, or in a freely-falling
elevator. Our accelerating framework removes all
sign of the gravitational field of Earth or Sun-&#39; on
a small local scale. Then we can leave a body to
move with no forces and watch its path. We call its
path in space-&amp;-time a straight line and we expect
to find simple mechanical laws obeyed. We have an
inertial frame in our locality.

( 4 ) Artificial Gravity. Conversely, by imposing a
large real acceleration we can manufacture a strong
force-field. If we trust the Principle of Equivalence
we expect this force-field to treat matter in the same
way as a very strong gravitational field. On this
view, centrifuging increases available "g" many
thousandfold.

(5) Myth-and-Symbol Experiment. To an ob-
server with acceleration a every mass m" seems to
suffer an opposite force of size m°a, in addition to
the pushes and pulls exerted on it by known agents.
In a gravitational field of strength g every mass m^
is pulled with a force m^g. Here, we are using m&#39;
for inertial mass, the m in F = ma, and m^ for gravi-
tational mass, the m in F = GMm/d^. The Principle
of Equivalence says that gravitational field of
strength g can be replaced in effect by an opposite
acceleration g of the observer.

.". m^g must be the same as m^g .&#39;. m^ ^ m"

The Principle of Equivalence requires gravitational
mass and inertial mass to be the same; and the
Myth-and-Symbol Experiment long ago told us that
they are. As you will see in the discussion that fol-
lows, Einstein, in his development of General Rela-
tivity, gave a deeper meaning for this equality of
the two kinds of mass.

General Relativity and Geometry

Over small regions of space-&amp;-time, the Earth&#39;s
gravity is practically uniform — and so is any other

" That is why the Sun&#39;s gravitational pull produces "no
noticeable field" as we move with the Earth around its yearly
orbit. (That phrase in the table of field values on p. 116 was
a quibble! ) Only if inertial mass and gravitational mass
failed to keep exactly the same proportion for different sub-
stances would any noticeable effect occur. Minute differences
of such a kind are being looked for — if any are discovered,
they will have a profound effect on our theory.

gravitational field. So we can "remove" gravity for
local experiments by having our lab accelerate
freely; and it will behave like an inertial frame with
no gravitational field: an object left alone will stay
at rest or move in a straight line; and with forces ap-
plied we shall find F ^=. ma. However, on a grander
scale, say all around the Earth or the Sun, we should
have to use many different accelerations for our
local labs to remove gravity. In fitting a straight
line defined in one lab by Newton&#39;s Law I to its
continuation in a neighboring lab, also accelerating
freely, we should find we have to &#39;Tjend" our straight
line to make it fit. The demands of bending would
get worse as we proceeded from lab to lab around
the gravitating mass. How can we explain that?
Instead of saying "we have found there is gravity
here after all" we might say "Euclidean geometry
does not quite fit the real world near the massive
Earth or Sun." The second choice is taken in develop-
ing General Relativity. As in devising Special Rela-
tivity, Einstein looked for the simplest geometry to
fit the new assumption that the laws of physics
should always take the same form. He arrived at a
General-Relativity geometry in which gravity disap-
pears as a strange force reaching out from matter;
instead, it appears as a distortion of space-&amp;-time
around matter.

"From time immemorial the physicist and the
pure mathematician had worked on a certain agree-
ment as to the shares which they were respectively
to take in the study of nature. The mathematician
was to come first and analyse the properties of space
and time building up the primary sciences of geome-
try and kinematics (pure motion); then, when the
stage had thus been prepared, the physicist was to
come along with the dramatis personae — material
bodies, magnets, electric charges, light and so forth —
and the play was to begin. But in Einstein&#39;s revolu-
tionary conception the characters created the stage
as they walked about on it: geometry was no longer
antecedent to physics but indissolubly fused with
it into a single discipline. The properties of space
in General Relativity depend on the material bodies
and the energy that are present. . . ."^*

Is this new geometry right and the old wrong?
Let us return to our view of mathematics as the
obedient servant. Could we not use any system of
geometry to carry out our description of the physical
world, stretching the world picture to fit the geome-
try, so to speak? Then our search would not be to
find the right geometry but to choose the simplest
or most convenient one which would describe the

" Sir Edmund Whittaker, From Euclid to Eddington,
op.cit., p. 117.



world with least stretching." If we do, we must
realize that we choose our geometry but we have
our universe; and if we ruthlessly make one fit the
other by pushing and pulling and distorting, then
we must take the consequences.

For example, if all the objects in our world con-
sisted of some pieces of the elastic skin of an orange,
the easiest geometrical model to fit them on would
be a ball. But if we were brought up with an un-
dying belief in plane geometry, we could press the
peel down on a flat table and glue it to the surface,
making it stretch where necessary to accommodate
to the table. We might find the cells of the peel
larger near the outer edge of our flattened piece,
but we should announce that as a law of nature. We
might find strange forces trying to make the middle
of the patch bulge away from the table — again, a
"law of nature." If we sought to simplify our view of
nature, the peel&#39;s behavior would tempt us to use a
spherical surface instead of a flat one, as our model
of "surface-space." All this sounds fanciful, and it
is; but just such a discussion on a three- or four-
dimensional basis, instead of a two-dimensional one,
has been used in General Relativity. The strange
force of gravity may be a necessary result of trying
to interpret nature with an unsuitable geometry —
the system Euclid developed so beautifully. If we
choose a different geometry, in which matter dis-
torts the measurement system around it, then gravi-
tation changes from a surprising set of forces to a
mere matter of geometry. A cannon ball need no
longer be regarded as being dragged by gravity in
what the old geometry would call a "curve" in space.
Instead, we may think of it as sailing serenely along
what the new geometry considers a straight line in
its space-&amp;-time, as distorted by the neighboring
Earth.

This would merely be a change of view (and
as scientists we should hardly bother much about
it), unless it could open our eyes to new knowledge
or improve our comprehension of old knowledge.
It can. On such a new geometrical view, the
"curved" paths of freely moving bodies are inlaid
in the new geometry of space-&amp;-time and all pro-
jectiles, big and small, with given speed must follow
the same path. Notice how the surprise of the
Myth-and-Symbol fact disappears. The long-stand-
ing mystery of gravitational mass being equal to
inertial mass is solved. Obviously a great property
of nature, this equality was neglected for centuries
until Einstein claimed it as a pattern property im-
posed on space-&amp;-time by matter.

Mathematics and Relativity



Even a light ray must follow a curve, just as much
as a bullet moving at light speed. Near the Earth
that curve would be imperceptible, but starlight
streaming past the Sun should be deflected by an
angle of about 0.0005 degrees, just measurable by
modern instruments. Photographs taken during total
eclipses show that stars very near the edge of the
Sun seem shifted by about 0.0006°. On the tradi-
tional ("classical") view, the Sun has a gravitational
field that appears to modify the straight-line law for
light rays of the Euclidean geometrical scheme. On
the General Relativity view, we replace the Sun&#39;s
gravitational field by a crumpling of the local ge-
ometry from simple Euclidean form into a version
where light seems to us to travel slower. Thus the
light beam is curved slightly around as it passes the
Sun — the reverse of the bending of light by hot air
over a road, when it makes a mirage.

Finding this view of gravitation both simple and
fruitful — when boiled down to simplest mathemati-
cal form — we would like to adopt it. In any ordinary
laboratory experiments we find Euclid&#39;s geometry
gives simple, accurate descriptions. But in astro-
nomical cases with large gravitational fields we
must either use a new geometry ( in which the mesh
of "straight lines" in space-&amp;-time seems to us
slightly crumpled) or else we must make some com-
plicating changes in the laws of physics. As in
Special Relativity, the modern fashion is to make
the change in geometry. This enables us to polish
up the laws of physics into simple forms which hold
universally; and sometimes in doing that we can see
the possibility of new knowledge.

In specifying gravitation on the new geometrical
view, Einstein found that his simplest, most plausi-
ble form of law led to slightly different predictions
from those produced by Newton&#39;s inverse-square
law of gravitation. He did not "prove Newton&#39;s Law
wrong" but offered a refining modification — though
this involved a radical change in viewpoint. We
must not think of either law as right because it is
suggested by a great man or because it is enshrined
in beautiful mathematics. We are offered it as a
brilliant guess from a great mind unduly sensitive
to the overtones of evidence from the real universe.
We take it as a promising guess, even a likely one,
but we then test it ruthlessly. The changes, from
Newton&#39;s predictions to Einstein&#39;s, though funda-
mental in nature, are usually too small in effect to
make any difference in laboratory experiments or
even in most astronomical measurements. But there
should be a noticeable effect in the rapid motion
of the planet Mercury around its orbit. Newton pre-

dieted a simple ellipse, with other planets producing
perturbations which could be calculated and ob-
served. General Relativity theory predicts an extra
motion, a very slow slewing around of the long axis
of the ellipse by 0.00119 degree per century. When
Einstein predicted it, this tiny motion was already
known, discovered long before by Leverrier. The
measured value, 0.001 17 "/century was waiting to
test the theory.

Accepting this view of gravity, astronomers can speculate on the geometry of all space and ask whether the universe is infinite or bounded by its own geometric curvature (as a sphere is ). 
We may yet be able to make some test of this question.


There are still difficulties and doubts about General Relativity.
Even as we use it confidently to deal with Mercury&#39;s motion, or the light from a massive star, we may have to anchor our calculations to some frame of reference, perhaps the remotest regions of space far from gravitating matter, or perhaps the center of gravity of our universe.
So space as we treat it, may have some kind of absolute milestones.
This doubt, this threat to a powerful theory, does not irritate the wise scientist: he keeps it in mind with hopes of an interesting future for his thoughts.


## New Mathematics for Nuclear Physics

In atomic and nuclear physics, mathematics now takes a strong hand. Instead of sketching a model with sharp bullet-like electrons whirling round an equally sharp nucleus, we express our knowledge of atoms in mathematical forms for which no picture can be drawn.
These forms use unorthodox rules of algebra, dreamed up for the purpose; and some show the usual mathematical trademark of waves.
Yet, although they remain mathematical forms, they yield fruitful predictions, ranging from the strength of metal wires and chemical energies to the behavior of radioactive nuclei.


We now see mathematics, pure thought and argument, again offering to present physics in clearer forms which help our thinking; but now far from a servant, it is rather a Lord Chancellor standing behind the throne of ruling Science to advise on law.
Or, we might describe mathematics as a master architect designing the building in which science can grow to its best.
