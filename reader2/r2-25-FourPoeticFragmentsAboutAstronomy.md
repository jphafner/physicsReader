## from <span class="textsc">Troilus and Cressida</span>

The heavens themselves, the planets and this center, 

Observe degree, priority and place, 

Insisture, course, proportion, season, form, 

Office and custom, in all line of order: 

And therefore is the glorious planet Sol 

In noble eminence enthroned and sphered 

Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye 

Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil, 

And posts like the commandment of a king. 

Sans check to good and bad: but when the planets 

In evil mixture to disorder wander, 

What plagues and what portents, what mutiny, 

What raging of the sea, shaking of earth, 

Commotion in the winds, frights, changes, horrors, 

Divert and crack, rend and deracinate 

The unity and married calm of states 

Quite from their fixture! O, when degree is snaked, 

Which is the ladder to all high designs, 

The enterprise is sick!

## from <span class="textsc">Hudibras, Second Part, Canto III</span>


The Egyptians say, The Sun has twice 

Shifted his setting and his rise; 

Twice has he risen in the West, 

As many times set in the East; 

But whether that be true, or no, 

The Devil any of you know. 

Some hold, the Heavens, like a Top, 

Are kept by Circulation up; 

And &#39;twere not for their wheeling round, 

They&#39;d instantly fall to the ground: 

As sage Empedocles &#39;of old, 

And from him Modern Authors hold. 

Plato believ&#39;d the Sun and Moon, 

Below all other Planets run. 

Some Mercury, some Venus seat 

Above the Sun himself in height. 

The learned Scaliger complain&#39;d 

&#39;Gainst what Copernicus maintain&#39;d, 

That in Twelve hundred years, and odd, 

The Sun had left his antient Road, 

And nearer to the Earth, is come 

&#39;Bove Fifty thousand miles from home.

## My Father&#39;s Watch

One night I dreamed I was locked in my Father&#39;s watch 

With Ptolemy and twenty-one ruby stars 

Mounted on spheres and the Primum Mobile 

Coiled and gleaming to the end of space 

And the notched spheres eating each other&#39;s rinds 

To the last tooth of time, and the case closed. 

What dawns and sunsets clattered from the conveyer 

Over my head and his while the ruby stars 

Whirled rosettes about their golden poles. 

&ldquo;Man, what a show!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Infinite order!&rdquo; 

Ptolemy sang. &ldquo;The miracle of things 

Wound endlessly to the first energy 

From which all matter quickened and took place!&rdquo; 

&ldquo;What makes it shine so bright?&rdquo; I leaned across 

Fast between two teeth and touched the mainspring. 

At once all hell broke loose. Over our heads 

Squadrons of band saws ripped at one another 

And broken teeth spewed meteors of flak 

From the red stars. You couldn&#39;t dream that din: 

I broke and ran past something into somewhere 

Beyond a glimpse of Ptolemy split open, 

And woke on a numbered dial where two black swords 

Spun under a crystal dome. There, looking up 

In one flash as the two swords closed and came, 

I saw my Father&#39;s face frown through the glass.

## from <span class="textsc">Il Vaneiger &hellip; </span>

On a baptise les etoiles san penser 

Qu&#39;elles n&#39;avaient pas besoin de nom, et les nombres 

Qui prouvent que les belles cometes dans l&#39;ombre 

Passeront, ne les forceront pas a passer
