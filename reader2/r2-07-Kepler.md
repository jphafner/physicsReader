The early part of the 17th century was the hinge on which the world view of the West, which had been dominated by scholasticism, turned toward science. 
In this period of transition the center of gravity of intellectual life shifted from the Scriptures to the Book of Nature. 
The stage for the later triumph of Newtonianism was being prepared by men working on problems that sprawled across the then indistinctly separated disciplines of mathematics, physics, astronomy, cosmology, philosophy and theology. 
It was, in short, the time of Kepler, Galileo and Descartes. 


Of the three Johannes Kepler is perhaps the most interesting, both as a scientist and as a personality. 
He is also the least known. 
Until now there has been no serious biography of him in English. 
This neglect has at last been remedied: The definitive biography by Max Caspar has been translated from the German by C. Doris Hellman of the Pratt Institute in New York. 

As Caspar warns the reader, &ldquo;No one who has once entered the magic sphere that surrounds [Kepler] can ever escape from it.&rdquo; 
Caspar devoted his whole life to Kepler; at the time of Caspar&#39;s recent death his monumental 13-volume edition of Kepler&#39;s collected works, his translation of Kepler&#39;s letters and his biography had already become a gold mine for scholars&mdash;and for popular writers. 
The more meritorious passages of Arthur Koestler&#39;s The Sleepwalkers, for example, are little more than a paraphrase of Caspar. 


Albert Einstein, who felt a deep kinship with Kepler (and who, like Kepler, was born in Swabia), said of him: &ldquo;He belonged to those few who cannot do otherwise than openly acknowledge their convictions on every subject.&rdquo; 
Caspar&#39;s dedication and erudition consequently found an enormous amount of material on which to feed. This book is not merely a detailed portrait of Kepler. 
It is also an account of the intellectual ferment from which modern science arose, and of the historical context: the tragic and turbulent age of the Counter Reformation and the Thirty Years&#39; War. 


From the beginning Kepler&#39;s personal life was unfortunate. 
His father Heinrich, as characterized by Kepler himself, was an immoral, rough and quarrelsome soldier; his mother Katharina.
a querulous and unpleasant woman, did not waste much love on her son. 
Too weak and sickly for agricultural labor, the boy was sent through a school system leading to theological studies at the Protestant seminary in T&uuml;bingen. 
One of his teachers, Michael Maestlin, introduced him privately to the Copernican system, which Maestlin was prohibited from teaching in his public lectures. 
This was the spark that set the youthful mind afire. 


At the age of 23, a few months before attaining the goal of his studies (the pulpit), Kepler was directed by his seminary to leave in order to serve as teacher of mathematics and astronomy at the seminary in Graz. 
He was a wretched teacher, and he had few students.  
This enabled him, however, to devote that much more time to other work. 
Although he spurned astrology as it was then practiced, he began to write horoscopes and prognostications. 
He had good reasons to do so: It was part of his official duties as district mathematician and calendar-maker; he believed that he could &ldquo;separate some precious stones from the dung&rdquo;; he was convinced that the harmonious arrangement of planets and stars could impart special qualities to the soul; he loved to spread his opinions among the noblemen and prelates who read these writings; he needed the money; and, last but not least, he found that his predictions were often accurate. 


At this time he also began a work that combined a little of each of his previous studies: of Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Augustine, Copernicus, Nicholas of Cusa and Luther. 
This was not merely astronomy; his aim was nothing less than to discover the plan of the Creator, &ldquo;to think the thoughts of God over again,&rdquo; and to show that His plan was Copernican. 
In 1597 Kepler published the <em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>, in which he hoped to show the reasons for the number of planets, the size of their orbits and their specific motions. 
His method was to search for geometrical regularities with which to &ldquo;explain&rdquo; physical observation.
His immense ingenuity, coupled with his unparalleled persistence, enabled him to uncover geometrical coincidences which satisfied him that his prejudices were correct. 
The key was his famous discovery that the relative radii of the planetary orbits in the heliocentric system correspond fairly well to the relative radii of thin spherical shells that may be thought to separate a nested arrangement of the five Platonic solids. 
(The agreement is surprisingly good; the discrepancy between the radii of the shells and those of the orbits according to Copernicus was within about 5 per cent, except for the single case of Jupiter&mdash;&ldquo;at which,&rdquo; Kepler said, &ldquo;nobody will wonder, considering the great distance.&rdquo;) 



Kepler soon saw that this was an incomplete effort at best, and changed his method of work. 
Still, the fundamental motivation behind the Mysterium Cosmographicum, namely the search for harmonies, remained strong throughout the remaining 33 years of his life.  
In 1597 he could feel the elation of the young man who, in Max Weber&#39;s phrase, &ldquo;finds and obeys the demon who holds the fibers of his very life.&rdquo; 


But in that same year the dark clouds that seemed always to hover over him sent down some lightning bolts. He married a young widow whom he described later as &ldquo;simple-minded and fat, confused and perplexed.&rdquo;
In 1600, the Counter Reformation having begun in earnest, all Protestants who did not choose to abandon their faith were banished from Graz. 
Kepler found an uncertain refuge in Prague with the aging and difficult Tycho Brahe, the foremost astronomer of his time, himself in exile from Denmark at the court of Emperor Rudolph. 


Brahe lived for only one more year. 
When he died, however, he left Kepler two great treasures: a healthy respect for accurate measurement, and a set of the best observations of planetary positions that had ever been made. 
Out of this raw material came Kepler&#39;s second great work, the Astronomia Nova, famous because it contained his first two laws of planetary motion. 
During this period Kepler also did fundamental work in optics. 


In 1612 he was obliged to leave Prague. 
His protector, the Emperor, had been forced to abdicate; Bohemia had been devastated by warfare among the contenders for the throne; his wife had died of a disease sweeping the capital. 
Kepler fled to Linz, where for 14 years he worked as a schoolteacher and district mathematician. 
At first this was the most tranquil time of his life. 
He brought out his Epitome, an account of the Copernican system which was more persuasive than Galileo&#39;s, but which was neglected by contemporary scholars, including Galileo. 
He chose a new wife in a comically careful way from 11 candidates (the choice turned out rather well), and fought in his Lutheran congregation for the right to interpret the concept of transubstantiation as he saw fit (he was deeply hurt when, as a result, his pastor excluded him from communion). 


This was also the time when Kepler&#39;s aged and feeble-minded mother was tried as a witch. 
It was a miserable affair, involving the full spectrum of human fears and stupidities. 
Kepler devoted a full year to her defense. 
He did not claim that witches did not exist, but only that his mother was not one. 
He barely managed to keep her from the rack and gallows. 
When one of his children died, he turned for solace to his work on the Harmonice Mundi, which contained his third law of planetary motion and was his last major book. 
He wrote: &ldquo;I set the Tables [the Rudolphine tables] aside, since they require peace, and turned my mind to the contemplation of the Harmony.&rdquo; 


Kepler discovered the third law in May, 1618; the month also marked the beginning of the Thirty Years&#39; War, which devastated Germany. 
Within a year the published part of his Epitome was placed on the Index of forbidden books. 
By 1626 his stay in Linz had become intolerable; his library had been sealed up by the Counter Reformation Commission; the countryside was swept by bloody peasant uprisings; the city of Linz was besieged; the press that had been printing the Rudolphine tables had gone up in flames. 
It seemed that he had no place to go. He was received splendidly in Prague by Emperor Ferdinand II, but he refused employment at the court because he would have had to embrace Catholicism. 
For a time he found refuge in the retinue of the Austrian duke Wallenstein, partly because of Wallenstein&#39;s interest in astrology. 
Then in 1630, as he was passing through Regensburg on a fruitless journey to collect some money that was owed him, he was seized by a fever and died. 
Soon afterward the churchyard in which he was buried was destroyed by one of the battles of the time. Caspar writes: &ldquo;It is as though the fate which in life gave him no peace continued to pursue him even after death.&rdquo; 


But Kepler had left something more durable than a headstone: the three laws of planetary motion. 
During his lifetime they attracted little attention. 
For a generation they slept quietly; then they awoke as the key inspiration for Newton&#39;s theory of universal gravitation. 


These three empirical rules for which Kepler is remembered are scattered through his voluminous work. 
They are almost submerged in a flood of other ideas: from a means of calculating the optimum size for wine casks to an attempt to fix the year of Christ&#39;s birth, from an excellent discussion of lens optics to an attempt to connect the position of planets with the local weather. 
(For 20 years Kepler faithfully made weather observations for this purpose; and at the end he bravely confessed that no connection was provable.) 


His whole work is characterized by this search for an arena of fruitful study in disciplines that, from our point of view, are incongruously mixed: physics and metaphysics, astronomy and astrology, geometry and theology, mathematics and music. 
But this was the time when the sciences were emerging from the matrix of general intellectual activity and assuming more specific forms. 
It fell to Kepler to show, through his successes and through his failures, where the fruitful ground for science lay. 
It was ground that he himself could not reach. 


If we look into Kepler&#39;s turbulent life and work for those brief moments that best illuminate the man and the time, I would select passages from two letters. 
One, written to Guldin in 1626, described Kepler&#39;s life during the long siege of Linz. 
His house was situated at the city wall around which the fighting was raging, and a whole company of soldiers was stationed in it. 
&ldquo;One had to keep all doors open for the soldiers, who through their continual coming day and night kept us from sleep and study.&rdquo; 
Here we find Kepler deep at work in technical chronology: &ldquo;I set to work against Joseph Scaliger&mdash;one thought followed the next, and I did not even notice how time was passing.&rdquo; 


The other revealing view of Kepler is provided by a letter to Herwart von Hohenburg in 1605. 
Here we come as close as we can to putting the finger on the moment when the modern mechanical-mathematical conception of science breaks out of its earlier mold. 
Kepler wrote: &ldquo;I am much occupied with the investigation of the physical causes. 
My aim in this is to show that the celestial machine is to be likened not to a divine organism but rather to a clockwork &hellip; insofar as nearly all the manifold movements are carried out by means of a single, quite simple magnetic force; as in the case of a clockwork all motions [are caused] by a simple weight. 
Moreover, I show how this physical conception is to be presented through calculation and geometry.&rdquo;


The celestial machine, driven by a single terrestrial force, in the image of a clockwork! 
This was indeed a prophetic goal. 
When the Astronomia Nova (on which Kepler was working at the time) was published four years later, it significantly bore the subtitle Physica Coelestis. 
Here we find the search for one universal force-law to explain terrestrial gravity and the oceanic tides as well as the motion of the planets. 
It is a conception of unity that is perhaps even more striking than Newton&#39;s, for the simple reason that Kepler did not have a predecessor. 


Kepler did not, of course, succeed in his aim to find the physics that explains astronomical observations in terms of mechanics. 
The Achilles heel of his celestial physics was his Aristotelian conception of the law of inertia, which identified inertia with a tendency to come to rest: &ldquo;Outside the field of force of another related body, every bodily substance, insofar as it is corporeal, by nature tends to remain at the same place at which it finds itself.&rdquo; 
(The quotation is from the Astronomia Nova.) 
This axiom deprived him of the concepts of mass and force in useful form, and without them his world machine was doomed. 


And yet, perhaps precisely because of the failure of his physics, he still had to see the world in one piece, holding before him an image in which there were three components: the universe as a physical machine, the universe as mathematical harmony and the universe as a central theological order. 
Taken by itself, any one of the three was incomplete and insufficient. 
It was Kepler&#39;s vision of all three together that makes him so interesting to us when we compare his view of the world to ours, so much more successful in each detail but&mdash;perhaps necessarily and irretrievably&mdash;so much more fragmented.
