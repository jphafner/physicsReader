intro: An article from <em>Science Journal</em>, 1965. 
---


Only a rash man would assert categorically that negative mass exists.
Yet he would be almost as rash if, equally categorically, he said that it does not. 
True, if negative mass exists it must have extraordinarily perplexing properties.
For example, if we pushed a piece of negative mass towards the left with our hand, it would move perversely towards the right; and, if that were not nonsense enough, as it moved towards the right we would not feel the negative mass resisting our thrust but actually aiding it. 


If the behaviour of negative mass is so seemingly nonsensical, why should one even think about it further?
It has never been observed.
Surely anyone who said that negative mass does not exist would be far less rash than one who thought that it might. 


So it would seem.
Yet the history of science should give us pause.
We have learned from bitter experience that what at first seems utter nonsense can prove to be excellent science.
For instance, who would have believed, at one time, that no material object can possibly move faster than light?
Or that an electron is, in a sense, both a particle and a wave?
Or that when two people are in relative motion each finds that the other&#39;s clock runs slow compared with his own?
Yet these, and many other such unlikely statements, are now part of the legitimate currency of science.

Even so, why should we seriously contemplate the idea of negative mass? 
The recently discovered quasi-stellar radio sources provide an answer. 
These objects, often referred to as quasars, pose a stark problem simply because they are, intrinsically, by far the brightest objects in the heavens. 
Not that they dazzle the eye. 
They are much too far away to do that, despite their brilliance. 
Indeed they are invisible to the naked eye.  
Though we owe their recognition in the first instance to the radio astronomers, it would be incorrect to say that the radio astronomers were the first to detect them. 
The quasars had often been photographed by the optical astronomers. 
But on the photographs they looked like faint stars of no particular interest; and with so many more glamorous celestial objects demanding their attention the optical astronomers had simply ignored them. 


Whenever the radio astronomers detected a source of radio waves in the heavens they told their optical confreres who then directed their largest telescopes towards the region in question. 
For the most part all was neat and orderly: the optical astronomers found visible objects that were clearly the sources of the radio waves&mdash;usually galaxies of one sort or another. 
Sometimes they drew a blank. And just occasionally they could find nothing except a star-like object so faint that if it were indeed an ordinary star it could not have given rise to the relatively strong radio waves that had been observed. 


Nevertheless, more precise radio bearings confirmed that these star-like objects were indeed the radio sources and from then on the puzzle grew until it reached massive proportions. 
In an expanding universe, the furthermost objects recede the fastest and this recession is evidenced by a shift of spectral lines towards the red. 
The quasars were found to have spectral red shifts corresponding to recession speeds as high as half the speed of light, implying that they were among the most distant known objects in the universe. 
This was incredible, if they were stars, since there are theoretical limits to the size and brightness of a star and no star could be bright enough to be observable at such distances. 
If the distances were correct, individual quasars must be emitting light at more than a million million times the rate of emission of the Sun and, indeed, something like a hundred times the rate of emission of a complete giant galaxy. 
Yet the quasars could not be anywhere near the size of an average galaxy which is tens of thousands of light years across: they would look larger if they were indeed that large. 
Another reason, less obvious, is that some of the quasars have rapid fluctuations in brightness, with periods measurable in years and even in weeks. 
Not only do galaxies maintain a steady bright less; there are also relativistic reasons for believing that an object whose brightness fluctuates with a period of a few years cannot be more than a few light years across. 


Thus, the astronomers were faced with a major problem: how could they account for the prodigious rate at which quasars were radiating energy, and what was the source of this energy ? 


Quasi-stellar radio source 3C 147 


In February of this year, there were 45 known quasars. 
By now the number is likely to be significantly larger. 
Several theories have been proposed to explain the nature of quasars and the source of their energy. 
Indeed, it is only with the recent advent of new observational techniques that the rate of discovery of quasars has significantly outstripped the rate of production of theories to account for their properties. 
If one tries to account for their spectacular brightness by conventional astrophysical processes, in terms of Einstein&#39;s relationship of energy to mass and the speed of light ($E=mc^2$), one is almost driven to assume it is due to a prodigious rate of supernova explosions; even then one has to postulate enormous amounts of matter. 


I. S. Shklovsky and G. R. Burbidge, among others, have suggested ways in which such explosions might occur frequently. 
Also, G. B. Field has proposed that a quasar is just an early stage in the evolution of a regular galaxy having relatively small rotational energy, the extraordinary brightness arising from the explosion of supernovae at the rate of about a hundred a year (the usual rate being one explosion every three or four hundred years in an average galaxy). 
Since the supernovae would explode at irregular intervals, this hypothesis could explain the fluctuating brightness but it would explain only the most rapid fluctuations and not one whose period was of the order of a decade. 


T. Gold has suggested that both the brightness and the fluctuations could come from frequent collisions of stars in a highly compact galaxy, the collisions tearing the stars open and exposing their glowing interiors. 


V. L. Ginzberg, among others, has looked to gravitation as a source of energy in the quasars. 
A tall building seems to be a placid unenergetic thing.
But if its foundations crumble it falls to the ground with devastating effect. 
In its upright position it has stored gravitational energy&mdash;put there by the cranes that lifted the building blocks&mdash;and when it collapses this energy is released. 
We do not know how matter came into existence, but it is dispersed throughout the universe and, in its dispersed state, it has gravitational energy akin to that of the upright building. 
As portions of matter come together locally under the influence of their mutual gravitation they transform part of their gravitational energy into energy of motion. 
Under normal conditions the celestial object built up in this way does not collapse. 
Its rotation tends to make it fly apart and thus counteracts the shrinking effect of gravitation. 
And if it does begin to collapse it usually tends to bounce back as the gravitational energy released is changed into motion. 
But F. Hoyle and W. A. Fowler, using the general theory of relativity, conceived of circumstances in which a gigantic &#39;star&#39; might suffer a really radical gravitational collapse, becoming a relatively minuscule object of stupendous density. 
In the process it could give off light and radio energy at the observed quasar rate, but to do so the &#39;star&#39; would have to contain an enormous amount of matter&mdash;a hundred million times that in the Sun.


Because the amounts of energy involved verge on the incredible, J. Terrell has suggested that the quasars are actually quite close, in astronomical terms, being fleeing fragments formed as a result of an explosion within our own galaxy. 
If so they would be much smaller and much less bright than had been supposed. 
But then one would have to ascribe the large red shifts of their spectral lines not to cosmological recession velocities, arising from the overall expansion of the universe, but to local recession velocities produced solely by the initial explosion. 
Although the amount of energy involved in this hypothesis is considerably less than that needed to account for quasars as very distant objects, it is nevertheless alarmingly large for a relatively local explosion, and to account for it Terrell feels a need to invoke a local gravitational collapse. 


J. A. Wheeler has proposed yet another idea which he bases on the Einstein concept of curved space in a gravitational field. 
If only one could ignore rotation, a sufficiently large amount of matter would inevitably undergo radical gravitational collapse. 
As the matter fell together to a density of unheard of proportions, the curvature of space would increase locally until a sort of open pouch, or pocket, or blister was formed. 
The greater the amount of matter falling into it, the more rotund the blister would become and, as it grew more concentrated, its neck would become ever narrower. 
Eventually the neck would close and the blister would become a hidden cyst of space, with never an external pucker to reveal its presence. 
The matter that had fallen into it would be lost completely to the outside world. 
Not even its gravitational effect would survive. 
But in falling it could give up all its energy (mc*) to the main part of the quasar, and this could be the fuel that kept the fire burning so brightly. 


<span class="textsc">There is yet another</span> possibility&mdash;if one can accept the idea of negative mass. 
For negative mass can act like a bank overdraft, allowing one to borrow energy for emergency purposes when high output is needed. 
And it has the considerable advantage over a bank overdraft that one can manage, in a sense, to avoid paying back what one has borrowed. 


Let us then, look more closely at the properties of negative mass, taking encouragement from the fact that neither the theory of relativity nor the quantum theory is a barrier to the existence of negative mass despite its awkward properties, and that negative mass can be excluded from those theories only by the arbitrary imposition of a ban from the outside. 
According to Newton, the gravitational attraction between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses. 
If one of the masses is negative and the other positive, their product will be negative and therefore so, too, will the gravitational attraction between them. Since a negative attraction is a repulsion, we might expect the two masses to accelerate away from each other. 
But this is not the case. 
Negative mass does not do the expected thing. 
Imagine the two masses placed side by side, the positive mass to the right of the negative mass. 
Their mutual gravitational repulsion accelerates the positive mass towards the right, of course. 
But what of the repulsion that acts on the negative mass? 
Since it is directed towards the left, and since negative mass acts perversely, the repulsion will cause the negative mass to move towards the right, that is towards the positive mass. 
Thus both masses move towards the right, the negative mass chasing the positive. 
Enormous speeds could be built up in the course of such a chase; and it seems that we would be getting something for nothing&mdash;generating energy without doing work, and thus violating the law of conservation of energy. 
But in fact we would not. 
True the faster the positive mass goes, the greater its energy. 
But the same is not true of the negative mass. 
The faster it goes, the more deeply negative its energy becomes. 
So the negative mass can chase the positive mass and generate enormous speeds while the total amount of energy remains unchanged. 


Once the perversity of negative mass is grasped, it is not difficult to see that positive mass causes both positive and negative mass to accelerate towards it gravitationally, but that negative mass gravitationally causes all mass, whether positive or negative, to accelerate away from it. 
Again, if two particles have electric charges that are either both positive or both negative, the particle of negative mass will still chase the particle of positive mass; but if the charges have opposite signs the particle of positive mass will do the chasing, provided that the electrical force is larger than the gravitational. 

Thus, we begin to see that the idea of negative mass might help to explain the enormous brightness of the quasars. 
But it is not enough simply to postulate the existence of negative mass. 
We must be able to explain why it has not been observed and we must present a specific mechanism by which negative mass could indeed fuel the quasar furnaces. 


<span class="textsc">If negative mass</span> exists we would expect all particles of positive mass to decay spontaneously into particles of negative mass, emitting radiation in the process and causing the material universe to blow up. 
Though this appears to be a formidable obstacle, we would be faint hearted to let it deflect us from our purpose. 
Indeed one needs no great courage, for theoretical physics has often been&mdash;and still is&mdash;plagued by similar theoretical catastrophes. 

Many decay mechanisms that one could argue as conceivable seem not to occur in nature. 
To account for such absences, theoretical physicists impose on their theories special conservation rules which forbid decays that the theories would otherwise permit. 
We can introduce an analogous conservation rule that would prevent particles of positive mass from decaying into particles of negative mass. 


But if we do, how are we ever going to general* particles of negative mass? 
Once again we take our cue from current atomic theory. 
Some of the conservation rules are not inviolate. 
We therefore make ours breakable too&mdash;but only under exceptional conditions. 

Conservation rules are always related to symmetries and they are broken when the corresponding symmetries are marred. 
Since, according to Einstein, gravitation is a curvature of space-time, it could well warp symmetries. 
So we imagine that in the presence of an extremely strong gravitational field the conservation rule prohibiting the formation of negative mass can be broken; and we say that only under extreme conditions such as exist within a quasar is this likely to occur. 


Next we recall that gravitation is different from all other forces, in that gravitational waves are generated by mass and themselves transport mass. 
(Electromagnetic waves, for example, are generated by electric charge but do not transport electric charge.) 
So we postulate that positive rest mass can decay into negative rest mass only if the energy is given off in the form of gravitational waves. 
This has two important consequences. 
First, gravitational waves are generated when a particle is accelerated by non-gravitational forces, and these will be particularly powerful in the hot, dense interior of a quasar. 
So much so that, with the requirement of an intense gravitational field, we can effectively confine the production of negative mass to such extreme circumstances as are likely to exist in the interiors of quasars. 


The second consequence has to do with a curious asymmetry between positive and negative mass in Einstein&#39;s theory. 
Work by H. Bondi and others indicates that, irrespective of whether the matter producing the gravitational waves is positive or negative, the waves carry away only positive energy and thus only positive mass. 
So if a particle of, say, <span class="math">6</span> units mass gave off gravitational waves whose energy had mass <span class="math">4</span>, it would end up with mass 2. But if a particle of mass 2 gave off gravitational waves of mass 4 it would be left with mass of —2, that is, a negative mass. 
It could not now give off gravitational waves of mass <span class="math">&minus;4</span> and return to a mass of $+2$.
If it gave off further gravitational waves of mass <span class="math">4</span> it would go to mass <span class="math">&minus;6</span> and so on. 
The process would slow down, however, since the more deeply negative the mass became the less easily would the particle be accelerated. 


The gravitational waves would be carrying energy to the more peripheral parts of the quasar while building up an energy deficit in the form of negative mass. 
Where, though, would the deficit be stored?
We might imagine that since matter of negative mass has negative density it would be far more buoyant than matter of positive mass and density. 
But once again the perversity of negative mass betrays our expectations. 
A particle of positive mass in a quasar would be pulled gravitationally towards the centre but buoyed up by the impacts of other particles. 
A particle of negative mass would also be accelerated gravitationally towards the centre but it would react perversely to the same impacts. 
It would therefore plunge towards the centre, and there it would mix with positive mass to form a growing core whose average mass was zero. 
Here, then, at the centre of the quasar, the deficit would reside&mdash;and accumulate. 
If the above theory is at all close to actuality, it is no wonder that negative mass, if it exists, has not been observed. 


But we are taking too easy a way out, a way reminiscent of the White Knight in &ldquo;Through the Looking Glass&rdquo; who 

<blockquote>
&ldquo;&hellip; was thinking of a plan To dye one&#39;s whiskers green, And always use so large a fan That they could not be seen.&rdquo; 
</blockquote>

The presence of a growing core of zero mass would increase the natural instability of a large celestial object. 
If an explosion occurred, negative mass could be ejected. 
What would happen to it?
It could not form stars of negative mass. 
Why not?
Because for negative mass gravitation is not a cohesive but a dispersive force. 
As a particle of negative mass travelled through space it would be attracted towards stars, and on falling into one would plunge to its centre. 


In the course of its travels, when it encountered particles of positive mass, especially if the negative and the positive particles were charged, the particle of negative mass would generate high velocities by the chasing process; and if one of these fast moving particles of positive mass entered our atmosphere it could give rise to a shower of cosmic rays of very great energy. 
It is not completely impossible that cosmic ray showers of puzzlingly high energy that have been observed might be due to such a cause.

What if one of the particles of negative energy entered the detection apparatus of a cosmic ray experimenter? 
This would be a rare event, since at best neither particles of negative mass nor cosmic ray experimenters are abundant. 
But if a cosmic ray experimenter ever found evidence of a particle going in one direction but pushing in the opposite direction that would indeed be a decisive event for it would show that, despite the many theoretical problems to which it would give rise, negative mass does indeed exist.
