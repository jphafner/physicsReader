## Astronomia Nova, Chapter 7, first part 

### On the Occasion When I Took up the Theory of Mars 

The divine voice that calls men to learn astronomy is, in truth, expressed in the universe itself, not by words or syllables, but by things themselves and by the agreement of the human intellect and senses with the ensemble of celestial bodies and phenomena. 
Nevertheless, there is a certain destiny which secretly drives men toward different arts and gives them the assurance that just as they are part of the works of creation, so also they participate in the divine Providence. 


Thus when I was old enough to taste the sweetness of philosophy, I embraced it all with an extreme passion, without taking a particular interest in astronomy. 
I have for it, certainly, a sufficient intelligence, and I understood without difficulty the geometry and astronomy imposed by the program of studies, which depends on figures, numbers and proportions. 
But these were the prescribed studies, and nothing indicated to me a particular inclination for astronomy. 


Since I was supported by a scholarship from the Duke of W&#39;urttemberg and when I saw that my fellow students would excuse themselves when the Prince was soliciting for foreign countries, although in face they simply refused for love of their native land, I decided very quickly, being of a tougher nature, to go immediately where I might be sent. 


The first place offered to me was an astronomical position into which, frankly, I was pushed only because of the authority of my teachers, not that I was frightened by the distance of the place&mdash;a fear I had condemned in the others (as I have said)&mdash;but because of the unexpected character and lowness of the position as well as the weakness of my knowledge in this part of philosophy. 
I accepted, therefore, being richer in ingenuity than in knowledge, and protesting highly that I would by no means abandon my right to another kind of life and ecclesiastical position that appeared to me much better. 
What was the success of my studies during the first two years appears in my <em>Mysterium Cosmographicum</em>.
Moreover, what stimulus my teacher Maestlin applied to me for taking up astronomy, you will read in the same little book and in his letter prefixed to the <em>Narratio</em> of Rheticus. 
I have esteemed my discovery very high, and much more so when I saw that it was approved so highly by Maestlin. 
But he did not stimulate me as much by the untimely promise made by him to the readers, of a general astronomical work by me (<em>Uranicum vel Cosmicum Opus</em>, as it was called), inasmuch as I was eager to inquire into the restoration of astronomy and to see if my discovery could be exposed to the discrimination of observations. 
Indeed it was demonstrated in the book itself that it agreed within the precision of common astronomy. 


Therefore at this time I began to think seriously of comparing it with observations. 
And when, in 1597, I wrote to Tycho Brahe asking him to tell me what he thought of my little work, in his answer he mentioned, among other things, his observations, he fired me with an enormous desire to see them. 
Moreover, Tycho Brahe, himself an important part in my destiny, did not cease from then on to urge that I come to visit him. But since the distance of the two places would have deterred me, I ascribe it to divine Providence that he came to Bohemia. 
I thus arrived there just before the beginning of the year 1600, with the hope of obtaining the correct eccentricities of the planetary orbits. 
When, in the first week, I learned that he himself along with Ptolemy and Copernicus employed the mean motion of the sun, but in fact the apparent motion agreed more with my little book, (as shown by the book itself), I was authorized to use the observations in my manner. 
Now at that time, his personal aide, Christian Severinus Longomontanus had taken up the theory of Mars, which was placed in his hands so that they might study the observation of the acronycal place, or opposition of Mars, with the sun in nine degrees of Leo. 
Had Christian been occupied with another planet, I would have started with that same one. 


This is why I consider it again an effect of divine Providence that I arrived at Benatek at the time when he was directed toward Mars; because for us to arrive at the secret knowledge of astronomy, it is absolutely necessary to use the motion of Mars; otherwise it would remain eternally hidden.
