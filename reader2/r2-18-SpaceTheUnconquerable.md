<span class="textsc">Man</span> will never conquer space. 
After all that has been said in the last two chapters, this statement sounds ludicrous. 
Yet it expresses a truth which our forefathers knew, which we have forgotten-and which our descendants must learn again, in heartbreak and loneliness. 


Our age is in many ways unique, full of events and phenomena which never occurred before and can never happen again. 
They distort our thinking, making us believe that what is true now will be true forever, though perhaps on a larger scale. 
Because we have annihilated distance on this planet, we imagine that we can do it once again. 
The facts are far otherwise, and we will see them more clearly if we forget the present and turn our minds toward the past. 


To our ancestors, the vastness of the Earth was a dominant fact controlling their thoughts and lives. 
In all earlier ages than ours, the world was wide indeed and no man could ever see more than a tiny fraction of its immensity. 
A few hundred miles a thousand, at the most-was infinity. 
Great empires and cultures could flourish on the same continent, knowing nothing of each other&#39;s existence save fables and rumors faint as from a distant planet. 
When the pioneers and adventurers of the past left their homes in search of new lands, they said good-by forever to the places of their birth and the companions of their youth. 
Only a lifetime ago, parents waved farewell to their emigrating children in the virtual certainty that they would never meet again.  
And now, within one incredible generation, all this has changed. 
Over the seas where Odysseus wandered for a decade, the Rome-Beirut Comet whispers its way within the hour. 
And above that, the closer satellites span the distance between Troy and Ithaca in less than a minute. 


Psychologically as well as physically, there are no longer any remote places on Earth. 
When a friend leaves for what was once a far country, even if he has no intention of returning, we cannot feel that same sense of irrevocable separation that saddened our forefathers. 
We know that he is only hours away by jet liner, and that we have merely to reach for the telephone to hear his voice. 
And in a very few years, when the satellite communication network is established, we will be able to see friends on the far side of the Earth as easily as we talk to them on the other side of the town. 
Then the world will shrink no more, for it will have become a dimensionless point. 


But the new stage that is opening up for the human drama will never shrink as the old one has done. 
We have abolished space here on the little Earth; we can never abolish the space that yawns between the stars. 
Once again, as in the days when Homer sang, we are face to face with immensity and must accept its grandeur and terror, its inspiring possibilities and its dreadful restraints. 
From a world that has become too small, we are moving out into one that will be forever too large, whose frontiers will recede from us always more swiftly than we can reach out toward them. 


Consider first the fairly modest solar, or planetary, distances which we are now preparing to assault. 
The very first Lunik made a substantial impression upon them, traveling more than two hundred million miles from Earth-six times the distance to Mars. When we have harnessed nuclear energy for space flight, the solar system will contract until it is little larger than the Earth today. 
The remotest of the planets will be perhaps no more than a week&#39;s travel from Earth, while Mars and Venus will be only a few hours away. 


This achievement, which will be witnessed within a century, might appear to make even the solar system a comfortable, homely place, with such giant planets as Saturn and Jupiter playing much the same role in our thoughts as do Africa or Asia today. 
(Their qualitative differences of climate, atmosphere, and gravity, fundamental though they are, do not concern us at the moment.) 
To some extent this may be true, yet as soon as we pass beyond the orbit of the Moon, a mere quarter-million miles away, we will meet the first of the barriers that will sunder Earth from her scattered children. 


The marvelous telephone and television network that will soon enmesh the whole world, making all men neighbors, cannot be extended into space. 
It will never be possible to converse with anyone on another planet. 


Do not misunderstand this statement. 
Even with today&#39;s radio equipment, the problem of sending speech to the other planets is almost trivial. 
But the messages will take minutes&mdash;sometimes hours&mdash;on their journey, because radio and light waves travel at the same limited speed of 186,000 miles a second. 
Twenty years from now you will be able to listen to a friend on Mars, but the words you hear will have left his mouth at least three minutes earlier, and your reply will take a corresponding time to reach him. 
In such circumstances, an exchange of verbal messages is possible&mdash;but not a conversation. 
Even in the case of the nearby Moon, the two-and-a-half second time lag will be annoying. 
At distances of more than a million miles, it will be intolerable. 


To a culture which has come to take instantaneous communication for granted, as part of the very structure of civilized life, this &ldquo;time barrier&rdquo; may have a profound psychological impact. 
It will be a perpetual reminder of universal laws and limitations against which not all our technology can ever prevail. 
For it seems as certain as anything can be that no signal-still less any material object-can ever travel faster than light. 


The velocity of light is the ultimate speed limit, being part of the very structure of space and time. 
Within the narrow confines of the solar system, it will not handicap us too severely, once we have accepted the delays in communication which it involves. 
At the worst, these will amount to eleven hours&mdash; the time it takes a radio signal to span the orbit of Pluto, the outer-most planet. 
Between the three inner worlds Earth, Mars, and Venus, it will never be more than twenty minutes&mdash;not enough to interfere seriously with commerce or administration, but more than sufficient to shatter those personal finks of sound or vision that can give us a sense of direct contact with friends on Earth, wherever they may be. 


It is when we move out beyond the confines of the solar system that we come face to face with an altogether new order of cosmic reality. 
Even today, many otherwise educated men-like those savages who can count to three but lump together all numbers beyond four&mdash;cannot grasp the profound distinction between <em>solar</em> and <em>stellar</em> space. 
The first is the space enclosing our neighboring worlds, the planets; the second is that which embraces those distant suns, the stars. 
<em>And it is literally millions of times greater</em>. 


There is no such abrupt change of scale in terrestrial affairs. 
To obtain a mental picture of the distance to the nearest star, as compared with the distance to the nearest planet, you must imagine a world in which the closest object to you is only five feet away&mdash;and then there is nothing else to see until you have traveled a thousand miles. 


Many conservative scientists, appalled by these cosmic gulfs, have denied that they can ever be crossed. 
Some people never learn; those who sixty years ago scoffed at the possibility of flight, and ten (even five!) 
years ago laughed at the idea of travel to the planets, are now quite sure that the stars will always be beyond our reach. 
And again they are wrong, for they have failed to grasp the great lesson of our age&mdash;that if something is possible in theory, and no fundamental scientific laws oppose its realization, then sooner or later it will be achieved.


One day&mdash;it may be in this century, or it may be a thousand years from now&mdash;we shall discover a really efficient means of propelling our space vehicles. 
Every technical device is always developed to its limit (unless it is superseded by something better) and the ultimate speed for spaceships is the velocity of light. 
They will never reach that goal, but they will get very close to it. 
And then the nearest star will be less than five years&#39; voyaging from Earth. 


Our exploring ships will spread outward from their home over an ever-expanding sphere of space. 
It is a sphere which will grow at almost&mdash;but never quite&mdash;the speed of light. 
Five years to the triple system of Alpha Centauri, ten to that strangely matched doublet Sirius A and B, eleven to the tantalizing enigma of 61 Cygni, the first star suspected of possessing a planet. 
These journeys are long, but they are not impossible. 
Man has always accepted whatever price was necessary for his explorations and discoveries, and the price of space is time. 


Even voyages which may last for centuries or millenniums will one day be attempted. 
Suspended animation, an undoubted possibility, may be the key to interstellar travel. 
Self-contained cosmic arks which will be tiny traveling worlds in their own right may be another solution, for they would make possible journeys of unlimited extent, lasting generation after generation. 
The famous time dilation effect predicted by the theory of relativity, whereby time appears to pass more slowly for a traveler moving at almost the speed of light, may be yet a third. 1 And there are others. 


With so many theoretical possibilities for interstellar flight, we can be sure that at least one will be realized in practice. 
Remember the history of the atomic bomb; there were three different ways in which it could be made, and no one knew which was best. 
So they were all tried-and they all worked. 


Looking far into the future, therefore, we must picture a slow (little more than half a billion miles an hour!) expansion of human activities outward from the solar system, among the suns scattered across the region of the Galaxy in which we now find ourselves. 
These suns are on the average five light-years apart; in other words, we can never get from one to the next in less than five years. 


To bring home what this means, let us use a down-to-earth analogy. 
Imagine a vast ocean, sprinkled with islands&mdash;some desert, others perhaps inhabited. 
On one of these islands an energetic race has just discovered the art of building ships. 
It is preparing to explore the ocean, but must face the fact that the very nearest island is five years&#39; voyaging away, and that no possible improvement in the technique of shipbuilding will ever reduce this time. 


In these circumstances (which are those in which we will soon find ourselves) what could the islanders achieve? 
After a few centuries, they might have established colonies on many of the nearby islands, and have briefly explored many others. 
The daughter colonies might themselves have sent out further pioneers, and so a kind of chain reaction would spread the original culture over a steadily expanding area of the ocean. 


But now consider the effects of the inevitable, unavoidable time lag. 
There could be only the most tenuous contact between the home island and its offspring. 
Returning messengers could report what had happened on the nearest colony&mdash;five years ago.  
They could never bring information more up to date than that, and dispatches from the more distant parts of the ocean would be from still further in the past&mdash;perhaps centuries behind the times. 
There would never be news from the other islands, but only history. 


No oceanic Alexander or Caesar could ever establish an empire beyond his own coral reef; he would be dead before his orders reached his governors. 
Any form of control or administration over other islands would be utterly impossible, and all parallels from our own history thus cease to have any meaning. 
It is for this reason that the popular science-fiction stories of interstellar empires and intrigues become pure fantasies, with no basis in reality. 
Try to imagine how the War of Independence would have gone if news of Bunker Hill had not arrived in England until Disraeli was Victoria&#39;s prime minister, and his urgent instructions on how to deal with the situation had reached America during President Eisenhower&#39;s second term. 
Stated in this way, the whole concept of interstellar administration or culture is seen to be an absurdity. 


All the star-borne colonies of the future will be independent, whether they wish it or not. 
Their liberty will be inviolably protected by time as well as space. 
They must go their own way and achieve their own destiny, with no help or hindrance from Mother Earth. 


At this point, we will move the discussion on to a new level and deal with an obvious objection. 
Can we be sure that the velocity of light is indeed a limiting factor? 
So many &ldquo;impassable&rdquo; barriers have been shattered in the past; perhaps this one may go the way of all the others. 


We will not argue the point, or give the reasons scientists believe that light can never be outraced by any form of radiation or any material object. 
Instead, let us assume the contrary and see just where it gets us. 
We will even take the most optimistic possible case, and imagine that the speed of transportation may eventually become infinite. 


Picture a time when, by the development of techniques as far beyond our present engineering as a transistor is beyond a stone ax, we can reach anywhere we please instantaneously, with no more effort than by dialing a number. 
This would indeed cut the universe down to size, and reduce its physical immensity to nothingness. What would be left? 


Everything that really matters. For the universe has two aspects&mdash;its scale, and its overwhelming, mind-numbing complexity. 
Having abolished the first, we are now face-to-face with the second. 


What we must now try to visualize is not size, but quantity. 
Most people today are familiar with the simple notation which scientists use to describe large numbers; it consists merely of counting zeros, so that a hundred becomes 10<sup>2</sup>, a million, 10<sup>6</sup>; a billion, 10<sup>9</sup> and so on. 
This useful trick enables us to work with quantities of any magnitude, and even defense budget totals look modest when expressed as $5.76&times;10<sup>9</sup> instead of $5,760,000,000. 


The number of other suns in our own Galaxy (that is, the whirlpool of stars and cosmic dust of which our Sun is an out-of-town member, lying in one of the remoter spiral arms) is estimated at about 10<sup>11</sup>&mdash;or written in full, 100,000,000,000. 
Our present telescopes can observe something like 10<sup>9</sup> other galaxies, and they show no sign of thinning out even at the extreme limit of vision. 
There are probably at least as many galaxies in the whole of creation as there are stars in our own Galaxy, but let us confine ourselves to those we can see. 
They must contain a total of about 10<sup>11</sup> times 10<sup>9</sup> stars, or 10<sup>20</sup> stars altogether. 


One followed by twenty other digits is, of course, a number beyond all understanding. 
There is no hope of ever coming to grips with it, but there are ways of hinting at its implications. 


Just now we assumed that the time might come when we could dial ourselves, by some miracle of matter transmission, effortlessly and instantly round the cosmos, as today we call a number in our local exchange. 
What would the cosmic telephone directory look like if its contents were restricted to suns and it made no effort to list individual planets, still less the millions of places on each planet? 


The directories for such cities as London and New York are already getting somewhat out of hand, but they list only about a million&mdash;10<sup>6</sup>&mdash;numbers. 
The cosmic directory would be 10<sup>14</sup> times bigger, to hold its 10<sup>20</sup> numbers. 
It would contain more pages than all the books that have ever been produced since the invention of the printing press. 


To continue our fantasy a little further, here is another consequence of twenty-digit telephone numbers. 
Think of the possibilities of cosmic chaos, if dialing 27945015423811986385 instead of 27945015243811986385 could put you at the wrong end of Creation. &hellip;
This is no trifling example; look well and carefully at these arrays of digits, savoring their weight and meaning, remembering that we may need every one of them to count the total tally of the stars, and even more to number their planets. 


Before such numbers, even spirits brave enough to face the challenge of the light-years must quail. 
The detailed examination of all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the world is a far smaller task than the exploration of the universe. 


And so we return to our opening statement. 
Space can be mapped and crossed and occupied without definable limit; but it can never be conquered. 
When our race has reached its ultimate achievements, and the stars themselves are scattered no more widely than the seed of Adam, even then we shall still be like ants crawling on the face of the Earth. 
The ants have covered the world, but have they conquered it&mdash;for what do their countless colonies know of it, or of each other?


So it will be with us as we spread outward from Mother Earth, loosening the bonds of kinship and understanding, hearing faint and belated rumors at second&mdash;or third&mdash;or thousandth-hand of an ever-dwindling fraction of the entire human race.
Though Earth will try to keep in touch with her children, in the end all the efforts of her archivists and historians will be defeated by time and distance, and the sheer bulk of material.
For the number of distinct societies or nations, when our race is twice its present age, may be far greater than the total number of all the men who have ever lived up to the present time.


We have left the realm of comprehension in our vain effort to grasp the scale of the universe; so it must always be, sooner rather than later. 


When you are next out of doors on a summer night, turn your head toward the zenith. 
Almost vertically above you will be shining the brightest star of the northern skies&mdash;Vega of the Lyre, twenty-six years away at the speed of light, near enough the point-of-no-return for us short-lived creatures. 
Past this blue-white beacon, fifty times as brilliant as our sun, we may send our minds and bodies, but never our hearts. 


For no man will ever turn homeward from beyond Vega to greet again those he knew and loved on Earth.
