In the last two chapters, we have seen that the prospects for interstellar communication over distances of some tens of light years seem reasonable; over hundreds of light years, more difficult; and over thousands of light years, only possibly by civilizations in substantial advance of our own. 
If it seemed likely that technical civilizations existed on planets only 10 or 20 light years away, or civilizations greatly in advance of our own, at larger distances, a serious effort to establish contact might be justified. 
On the other hand, if we can only reasonably expect civilizations at about our level of technical advance thousands of light years away, attempts at communication would not seem profitable, at least at the present time.
In the present chapter, we shall make some effort to compute the number of extant technical civilizations in the Galaxy, which will permit us to estimate the average distances between civilizations. 
To perform such estimates, we must select numerical values for quantities which are extremely poorly known, such as the average lifetime of a technical civilization. The reliability of our answers will reflect this uncertainty. 
&#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup--> The analysis will have an exclusively probabilistic character, &#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup--> and the reader is invited to make his own estimate of the numerical values involved, and to draw his own conclusions on the numbers of advanced technical civilizations in the Galaxy. 
A However, these analyses are of undoubted methodological interest and illustrate very well the potentialities and limitations of this type of investigation. 

&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> We shall be concerned with two general approaches: first, a simple discussion due essentially to Frank Drake, and then a more elaborate treatment due to the German astronomer Sebastian von Hoerner, when he was working at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank, West Virginia. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> We desire to compute the number of extant Galactic communities which have attained a technical capability substantially in advance of our own. 
At the present rate of technological progress, we might picture this capability as several hundred years or more beyond our own stage of development. 
A simple method of computing this number, N, was discussed extensively at a conference on intelligent extraterrestrial life, held at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in November, 1961, and sponsored by the Space Science Board of the National Academy of Sciences. 
Attending this meeting were D. W. Atchley, Melvin Calvin, Giuseppe Cocconi, Frank Drake, Su-Shu Huang, John C. Lilley, Philip M. Morrison, Bernard M. Oliver, J. P. T. Pearman, Carl Sagan, and Otto Struve. 
While the details differ in several respects, the following discussion is in substantial agreement with the conclusions of the conference. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> The number of extant advanced technical civilizations possessing both the interest and the capability for interstellar communication can be expressed as

<span class="math">R<sub>*</sub></span> is the mean rate of star formation, averaged over the lifetime of the Galaxy;
<span class="math">f_p</span> is the fraction of stars with planetary systems;
<span class="math">n_c</span> is the mean number of planets in each planetary system with environments favorable for the origin of life;
<span class="math">f_l</span> is the fraction of such favorable planets on which life does develop;
<span class="math">f_i</span> is the fraction of such inhabited planets on which intelligent life with manipulative abilities arises during the lifetime of the local sun;
<span class="math">f_c</span> is the fraction of planets populated by intelligent beings on which an advanced technical civilization in the sense previously defined arises, during the lifetime of the local sun;
and <span class="math">L</span> is the lifetime of the technical civilization. 
We now proceed to discuss each parameter in turn. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> Since stars of solar mass or less have lifetimes on the main sequence comparable to the age of the Galaxy, it is not the present rate of star formation, but the mean rate of star formation during the age of the Galaxy which concerns us here. 
The number of known stars in the Galaxy is &sim; 10<sup>11</sup>, most of which have masses equal to or less than that of the Sun. 
The age of the Galaxy is &sim; 10<sup>10</sup> years. 
Consequently, a first estimate for the mean rate of star formation would be &sim; 10 stars year<sup>&minus;1</sup>. 
The present rate of star formation is at least an order of magnitude less than this figure, and according to the Dutch-American astronomer Maarten Schmidt, of Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories, the rate of star formation in early Galactic history is possibly several orders of magnitude greater. 
According to present views of element synthesis in stars, discussed in Chapter 8, those stars and planets formed in the early history of the Galaxy must have been extremely poor in heavy elements. 
Technical civilizations developed on such ancient planets would of necessity be extremely different from our own. 
But in the flurry of early star formation, when the Galaxy was young, heavy elements must have been generated rapidly, and later generations of stars and planets would have had adequate endowments of the heavy elements. 
These very early systems should be subtracted, from our estimate of <span class="math">R<sub>*</sub></span>.
On the other hand, there are probably vast numbers of undetected low-mass stars whose inclusion will tend to increase our estimate of <span class="math">R<sub>*</sub></span>. 
For present purposes, we adopt <span class="math">R<sub>*</sub> &sim; 10</span> stars year<sup>&minus;1</sup>. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> From the frequencies of dark companions of nearby stars, from the argument on stellar rotation, and from contemporary theories of the origin of the solar system [see Chapters 11-13], we have seen that planets seem to be a very common, if not invariable, accompaniment to main sequence stars. 
We therefore adopt <span class="math">f<sub>p</sub> &sim; 1</span>. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> In Chapter 11, we saw that even many multiple star systems may have planets in sufficiently stable orbits for the origin and development of life. 
In our own solar system, the number of planets which are favorably situated for the origin of life at some time or another is at least one, probably two, and possibly three or more [see Chapters 16, 19, 20, and 23]. 
We expect main sequence stars of approximately solar spectral type&mdash;say, between F2 and K5&mdash;to have a similar distribution of planets, and for such stars, we adopt <span class="math">n<sub>e</sub> &sim; 1</span>. 
However, the bulk of the main sequence stars&mdash;well over 60 percent&mdash;are M stars; as we mentioned in Chapter 24, if the planets of these suns are distributed with just the same spacings as the planets of our Sun, even the innermost will be too far from its local sun to be heated directly to temperatures which we would consider clement for the origin and evolution of life. 
However, it is entirely possible that such lower-luminosity stars were less able to clear their inner solar systems of nebular material from which the planets were formed early in their history. 
Further, the greenhouse effect in Jovian-type planets of M stars should produce quite reasonable temperatures. 
We therefore tentatively adopt for main sequence stars in general <span class="math">n<sub>c</sub> &sim; 1</span>.


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> In Chapters 14-17, we discussed the most recent work on the origin of life on Earth, which suggests that life arose very rapidly during the early history of the Earth. 
We discussed the hypothesis that the production of self-replicating molecular systems is a forced process which is bound to occur because of the physics and chemistry of primitive planetary environments. 
Such self-replicating systems, with some minimal control of their environments and situated in a medium filled with replication precursors, satisfy all the requirements for natural selection and biological evolution. 
Given sufficient time and an environment which is not entirely static, the evolution of complex organisms is, in this view, inevitable. 
The finding of even relatively simple life forms on Mars or other planets within our solar system would tend to confirm this hypothesis. In our own solar system, the origin of life has occurred at least once, and possibly two or more times.
We adopt <span class="math">f<sub>f</sub> &sim; 1</span>.


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> The question of the evolution of intelligence is a difficult one. 
This is not a field which lends itself to laboratory experimentation, and the number of intelligent species available for study on Earth is limited. 
In Chapter 25, we alluded to some of the difficulties of this problem. 
Our technical civilization has been present for only a few billion ths of geological time; yet it has arrived about midway in the lifetime of our Sun on the main sequence. 
The evolution of intelligence and manipulative abilities has resulted from the product of a large number of individually unlikely events. 
On the other hand, the adaptive value of intelligence and of manipulative ability is so great&mdash;at least until technical civilizations are developed&mdash;that if it is genetically feasible, natural selection seems likely to bring it forth. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> The American physiologist John C. Lilley, of the Communication Research Institute, Coral Gables, Florida, has argued that the dolphins and other cetacea have surprisingly high levels of intelligence. 
Their brains are almost as large as those of human beings. 
These brains are as convoluted as our brains, and their neural anatomy is remarkably similar to that of the primates, although the most recent common ancestor of the two groups lived more than 100 million years ago. 
Dolphins are capable of making a large number of sounds of great complexity, which are almost certainly used for communication with other dolphins. 
The most recent evidence suggests that they are capable of counting, and can mimic human speech. 
Large numbers of anecdotes supposedly illustrating great intelligence in the dolphins have been recorded, from the time of Pliny to the present. 
The detailed study of dolphin behavior and serious attempts to communicate with them are just beginning and hold out the possibility that some day we will be able to communicate, at least at a low level, with another intelligent species on our planet. 
Dolphins have very limited manipulative abilities, and despite their apparent level of intelligence, could not have developed a technical civilization. 
But their intelligence and communicativeness strongly suggest that these traits are not limited to the human species. 
With the expectation that the Earth is not unique as the abode of creatures with intelligence and manipulative abilities, but also allowing for the fact that apparently only one such species has developed so far in its history, and this only recently, we adopt <span class="math">f<sub>f</sub> &sim; 10<sup>&minus;1</sup></span>. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> The present technical civilization of the planet Earth can be traced from Mesopotamia to Southeastern Europe, to Western and Central Europe, and then to 
Eastern Europe and North America. Suppose that somewhere along the tortuous path of cultural history, an event had differed. 
Suppose Charles Martel had not stopped the Moors at Tours in 732 a.d. 
Suppose Ogdai had not died at Karakorum at the moment that Subutai&#39;s Mongol armies were entering Hungary and Austria, and that the Mongol invasion had swept through the non-forested regions of western Europe. 
Suppose the classical writings of Greek and Roman antiquity had not been preserved through the Middle Ages in African mosques and Irish monasteries. 
There are a thousand &ldquo;supposes.&rdquo; 
Would Chinese civilization have developed a technical civilization if entirely insulated from the West? 
Would Aztec civilization have developed a technical phase had there been no conquistadores? 
Recorded history, even in mythological guise, covers less than 10<sup>&minus;2</sup> of the period in which the Earth has been inhabited by hominids, and less than about 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> of geological time. 
The same considerations are involved here as in the determination of <span class="math">f_i</span>.
The development of a technical civilization has high survival value at least up to a point; but in any given case, it depends on the concatenation of many improbable events, and it has occurred only recently in terrestrial history. 
It is unlikely that the Earth is very extraordinary in possessing a technical civilization, among planets already inhabited by intelligent beings. 
As before, over stellar evolutionary timescales, we adopt <span class="math">f<sub>c</sub> &sim; 10<sup>&minus;1</sup></span>.


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> The multiplication of the preceding factors gives <span class="math">N = 10<sup>10</sup> &times; 1 &times; 1 &times; 1 &times; 10<sup>&minus;1</sup> &times; 10<sup>&minus;1</sup> &times; L = 10<sup>&minus;1</sup> &times; L</span>.
<span class="math">L</span> is the mean lifetime in years of a technical civilization possessing both the interest and the capability for interstellar communication. 
For the evaluation of <span class="math">L</span> there is&mdash;fortunately for us, but unfortunately for the discussion&mdash;not even one known terrestrial example. 
The present technical civilization on Earth has reached the communicative phase (in the sense of high-gain directional antennas for the reception of extraterrestrial radio signals) only within the last few years. 
There is a sober possibility that <span class="math">L</span> for Earth will be measured in decades. 
On the other hand, it is possible that international political differences will be permanently settled, and that <span class="math">L</span> may be measured in geological time. 
It is conceivable that on other worlds, the resolution of national conflicts and the establishment of planetary governments are accomplished before weapons of mass destruction become available. 
We can imagine two extreme alternatives for the evaluation of <span class="math">L</span>: (a) a technical civilization destroys itself soon after reaching the communicative phase (<span class="math">L</span> less than 10 2 years); or (b) a technical civilization learns to live with itself soon after reaching the communicative phase. 
If it survives more than 10<sup>2</sup> years, it will be unlikely to destroy itself afterwards. 
In the latter case, its lifetime may be measured on a stellar evolutionary timescale (<span class="math">L</span> much greater than 10 8 years). Such a society will exercise self-selection on its members. 
The slow, otherwise inexorable genetic changes which might in one of many ways make the individuals unsuited for a technical civilization could be controlled. 
The technology of such a society will certainly be adequate to cope with geological changes, although its origin is sensitively dependent on geology. 
Even the evolution of the local sun through the red giant and white dwarf evolutionary stages may not pose insuperable problems for the survival of an extremely advanced community. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> It seems improbable that surrounded by large numbers of flourishing and diverse galactic communities, a given advanced planetary civilization will retreat from the communicative phase. 
This is one reason that <span class="math">L</span> itself depends on <span class="math">N</span>.  
Von Hoerner has suggested another reason: He feels that the means of avoiding self-destruction will be among the primary contents of initial interstellar communications. 
If <span class="math">N</span> is large, the values of <span class="math">f_l</span>, <span class="math">f_i</span>, and <span class="math">f_c</span> may also be larger as a result. 
In Chapter 15, we mentioned the possibility of the conscious introduction of life into an otherwise sterile planet by interstellar space travelers. 
In Chapter 33, below, we shall discuss the possibility that such interstellar space travelers might also affect the value of <span class="math">f_c</span>. 


&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> Our two choices for <span class="math">L</span>&mdash;&lt; 10<sup>2</sup> years; and &gt;&gt; 10<sup>8</sup> years&mdash;lead to two values for <span class="math">N</span>: less than ten communicative civilizations in the Galaxy; or many more than 10<sup>7</sup>.
In the former case, we might be the only extant civilization; in the latter case, the Galaxy is filled with them. 
The value of <span class="math">N</span> depends very critically on our expectation for the lifetime of an average advanced community. 
It seems reasonable to me that at least a few percent of the advanced technical civilizations in the Galaxy do not destroy themselves, nor lose interest in interstellar communication, nor suffer insuperable biological or geological catastrophes, and that their lifetimes, therefore, are measured on stellar evolutionary timescales. 
As an average for all technical civilizations, both short-lived and long-lived, I adopt <span class="math">L &sim; 10<sup>7</sup></span> years. 
This then yields as the average number of extant advanced technical civilizations in the Galaxy 

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="N \approx 10^6" display="block">

Thus, approximately 0.001 percent of the stars in the sky will have a planet upon which an advanced civilization resides. 
The most probable distance to the nearest such community is then several hundred light years. 
(In the Space Science Board Conference on Intelligent Extraterrestrial Life, previously mentioned, the individual values of <span class="math">N</span> selected lay between 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>9</sup> civilizations. 
The corresponding range of distances to the nearest advanced community is then between ten and several thousands of light years.) &#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup-->
