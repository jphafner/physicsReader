### The Preface of Nicolaus Copernicus to the Books of the Revolutions

I may well presume, most Holy Father, that certain people, as soon as they hear that in this book On the Revolutions of the Spheres of the Universe I ascribe movement to the earthly globe, will cry out that, holding such views, I should at once be hissed off the stage.
For I am not so pleased with my own work that I should fail duly to weigh the judgment which others may pass thereon; and though I know that the speculations of a philosopher are far removed from the judgment of the multitude&mdash;for his aim is to seek truth in all things as far as God has permitted human reason so to do&mdash;yet I hold that opinions which are quite erroneous should be avoided.


Thinking therefore within myself that to ascribe movement to the Earth must indeed seem an absurd performance on my part to those who know that many centuries have consented to the establishment of the contrary judgment, namely that the Earth is placed immovably as the central point in the middle of the Universe, I hesitated long whether, on the one hand, I should give to the light these my Commentaries written to prove the Earth&#39;s motion, or whether, on the other hand, it were better to follow the example of the Pythagoreans and others who were wont to impart their philosophic mysteries only to intimates and friends, and then not in writing but by word of mouth, as the letter of Lysis to Hipparchus witnesses.
In my judgment they did so not, as some would have it, through jealousy of sharing their doctrines, but as fearing lest these so noble and hardly won discoveries of the learned should be despised by such as either care not to study aught save for gain, or&mdash;if by the encouragement and example of others they are stimulated to philosophic liberal pursuits&mdash;yet by reason of the dulness of their wits are in the company of philosophers as drones among bees.
Reflecting thus, the thought of the scorn which I had to fear on account of the novelty and incongruity of my theory, well-nigh induced me to abandon my project.


These misgivings and actual protests have been overcome by my friends.
First among these was Nicolaus Schonberg, Cardinal of Capua, a man renowned in every department of learning.
Next was one who loved me well, Tiedemann Giese, Bishop of Kulm, a devoted student of sacred and all other good literature, who often urged and even importuned me to publish this work which I had kept in store not for nine years only, but to a fourth period of nine years.
The same request was made to me by many other eminent and learned men.
They urged that I should not, on account of my fears, refuse any longer to contribute the fruits of my labours to the common advantage of those interested in mathematics.
They insisted that, though my theory of the Earth&#39;s movement might at first seem strange, yet it would appear admirable and acceptable when the publication of my elucidatory comments should dispel the mists of paradox.
Yielding then to their persuasion I at last permitted my friends to publish that work which they have so long demanded.


That I allow the publication of these my studies may surprise your Holiness the less in that, having been at such travail to attain them, I had already not scrupled to commit to writing my thoughts upon the motion of the Earth.
How I came to dare to conceive such motion of the Earth, contrary to the received opinion of the Mathematicians and indeed contrary to the impression of the senses, is what your Holiness will rather expect to hear.
So I should like your Holiness to know that I was induced to think of a method of computing the motions of the spheres by nothing else than the knowledge that the Mathematicians are inconsistent in these investigations.


For, first, the mathematicians are so unsure of the movements of the Sun and Moon that they cannot even explain or observe the constant length of the seasonal year.
Secondly, in determining the motions of these and of the other five planets, they do not even use the same principles and hypotheses as in their proofs of seeming revolutions and motions.
So some use only concentric circles, while others eccentrics and epicycles.
Yet even by these means they do not completely attain their ends.
Those who have relied on concentrics, though they have proven that some different motions can be compounded therefrom, have not thereby been able fully to establish a system which agrees with the phenomena.
Those again who have devised eccentric systems, though they appear to have well-nigh established the seeming motions by calculations agreeable to their assumptions, have yet made many admissions which seem to violate the first principle of uniformity in motion.
Nor have they been able thereby to discern or deduce the principal thing&mdash;namely the shape of the Universe and the unchangeable symmetry of its parts.
With them it is as though an artist were to gather the hands, feet, head and other members for his images from divers models, each part excellently drawn, but not related to a single body, and since they in no way match each other, the result would be monster rather than man.
So in the course of their exposition, which the mathematicians call their system ($\mu\acute{\epsilon}\theta o\delta o\zeta$) we find that they have either omitted some indispensable detail or introduced something foreign and wholly irrelevant.
This would of a surety not have been so had they followed fixed principles; for if their hypotheses were not misleading, all inferences based thereon might be surely verified.
Though my present assertions are obscure, they will be made clear in due course.


I pondered long upon this uncertainty of mathematical tradition in establishing the motions of the system of the spheres.
At last I began to chafe that philosophers could by no means agree on any one certain theory of the mechanism of the Universe, wrought for us by a supremely good and orderly Creator, though in other respects they investigated with meticulous care the minutest points relating to its orbits.
I therefore took pains to read again the works of all the philosophers on whom I could lay hand to seek out whether any of them had ever supposed that the motions of the spheres were other than those demanded by the mathematical schools.
I found first in Cicero that Hicetas [^2]
had realized that the Earth moved.
Afterwards I found in Plutarch that certain others had held the like opinion. I think fit here to add Plutarch&#39;s own words, to make them accessible to all:&mdash;

<blockquote>
    &ldquo;The rest hold the Earth to be stationary, but Philolaus the Pythagorean says that she moves around the (central) fire on an oblique circle like the Sun and Moon.
    Heraclides of Pontus and Ecphantus the Pythagorean also make the Earth to move, not indeed through space but by rotating round her own centre as a wheel on an axle [^1] from West to East.&rdquo;
</blockquote>


Taking advantage of this I too began to think of the mobility of the Earth; and though the opinion seemed absurd, yet knowing now that others before me had been granted freedom to imagine such circles as they chose to explain the phenomena of the stars, I considered that I also might easily be allowed to try whether, by assuming some motion of the Earth, sounder explanations than theirs for the revolution of the celestial spheres might so be discovered.


Thus assuming motions, which in my work I ascribe to the Earth, by long and frequent observations I have at last discovered that, if the motions of the rest of the planets be brought into relation with the circulation of the Earth and be reckoned in proportion to the orbit of each planet, not only do their phenomena presently ensue, but the orders and magnitudes of all stars and spheres, nay the heavens themselves, become so bound together that nothing in any part thereof could be moved from its place without producing confusion of all the other parts and of the Universe as a whole.


In the course of the work the order which I have pursued is as here follows.
In the first book I describe all positions of the spheres together with such movements as I ascribe to Earth; so that this book contains, as it were, the general system of the Universe.
Afterwards, in the remaining books, I relate the motions of the other planets and all the spheres to the mobility of Earth, that we may gather thereby how far the motions and appearances of the rest of the planets and spheres may be preserved, if related to the motions of the Earth.


I doubt not that gifted and learned mathematicians will agree with me if they are willing to comprehend and appreciate, not superficially but thoroughly, according to the demands of this science, such reasoning as I bring to bear in support of my judgment.
But that learned and unlearned alike may see that I shrink not from any man&#39;s criticism, it is to your Holiness rather than anyone else that I have chosen to dedicate these studies of mine, since in this remote corner of Earth in which I live you are regarded as the most eminent by virtue alike of the dignity of your Office and of your love of letters and science.
You by your influence and judgment can readily hold the slanderers from biting, though the proverb hath it that there is no remedy against a sycophant&#39;s tooth.
It may fall out, too, that idle babblers, ignorant of mathematics, may claim a right to pronounce a judgment on my work, by reason of a certain passage of Scripture basely twisted to suit their purpose.
Should any such venture to criticize and carp at my project, I make no account of them; I consider their judgment rash, and utterly despise it.
I well know that even Lactantius, a writer in other ways distinguished but in no sense a mathematician, discourses in a most childish fashion touching the shape of the Earth, ridiculing even those who have stated the Earth to be a sphere.
Thus my supporters need not be amazed if some people of like sort ridicule me too.


Mathematics are for mathematicians, and they, if I be not wholly deceived, will hold that these my labours contribute somewhat even to the Commonwealth of the Church, of which your Holiness is now Prince.
For not long since, under Leo X, the question of correcting the ecclesiastical calendar was debated in the Council of the Lateran.
It was left undecided for the sole cause that the lengths of the years and months and the motions of the Sun and Moon were not held to have been yet determined with sufficient exactness.
From that time on I have given thought to their more accurate observation, by the advice of that eminent man Paul, Lord Bishop of Sempronia, sometime in charge of that business of the calendar.
What results I have achieved therein, I leave to the judgment of learned mathematicians and of your Holiness in particular.
And now, not to seem to promise your Holiness more than I can perform with regard to the usefulness of the work, I pass to my appointed task.
