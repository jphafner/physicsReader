Great indeed are the things which in this brief treatise I propose for observation and consideration by all students of nature.
I say great, because of the excellence of the subject itself, the entirely unexpected and novel character of these things, and finally because of the instrument by means of which they have been revealed to our senses.


Surely it is a great thing to increase the numerous host of fixed stars previously visible to the unaided vision, adding countless more which have never before been seen, exposing these plainly to the eye in numbers ten times exceeding the old and familiar stars.

It is a very beautiful thing, and most gratifying to the sight, to behold the body of the moon, distant from us almost sixty earthly radii [^2] as if it were no farther away than two such measures&mdash;so that its diameter appears almost thirty times larger, its surface nearly nine hundred times, and its volume twenty-seven thousand times as large as when viewed with the naked eye.
In this way one may learn with all the certainty of sense evidence that the moon is not robed in a smooth and polished surface but is in fact rough and uneven, covered everywhere, just like the earth&#39;s surface, with huge prominences, deep valleys, and chasms.

Again, it seems to me a matter of no small importance to have ended the dispute about the Milky Way by making its nature manifest to the very senses as well as to the intellect.
Similarly it will be a pleasant and elegant thing to demonstrate that the nature of those stars which astronomers have previously called &ldquo;nebulous&rdquo; is far different from what has been believed hitherto.
But what surpasses all wonders by far, and what particularly moves us to seek the attention of all astronomers and philosophers, is the discovery of four wandering stars not known or observed by any man before us.
Like Venus and Mercury, which have their own periods about the sun, these have theirs about a certain star that is conspicuous among those already known, which they sometimes precede and sometimes follow, without ever departing from it beyond certain limits.
All these facts were discovered and observed by me not many days ago with the aid of a spyglass which I devised, after first being illuminated by divine grace.
Perhaps other things, still more remarkable, will in time be discovered by me or by other observers with the aid of such an instrument, the form and construction of which I shall first briefly explain, as well as the occasion of its having been devised.
Afterwards I shall relate the story of the observations I have made.


[^1]: The word &ldquo;telescope&rdquo; was not coined until 1611. A detailed account of its origin is given by Edward Rosen in The Naming of the Telescope (New York, 1947). In the present translation the modern term has been introduced for the sake of dignity and ease of reading, but only after the passage in which Galileo describes the circumstances which led him to construct the instrument (pp. 28-29).

[^2]: The original text reads &ldquo;diameters&rdquo; here and in another place. That this error was Galileo&#39;s and not the printer&#39;s has been convincingly shown by Edward Rosen (<em>Isis</em>, 1952, pp. 344 ff.). The slip was a curious one, as astronomers of all schools had long agreed that the maximum distance of the moon was approximately sixty terrestrial radii. Still more curious is the fact that neither Kepler nor any other correspondent appears to have called Galileo s attention to this error; not even a friend who ventured to criticize the calculations in this very passage.
