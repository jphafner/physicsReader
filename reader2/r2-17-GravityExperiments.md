<blockquote>
<span class="textsc">In Brief:</span>
Meaningful experiments concerning the nature of gravity are few and far between&mdash;for two reasons: gravitational forces are woefully weak, so data sufficiently precise to be meaningful are hard to come by; and the essential nature of gravity lies hidden in the theoretical labyrinth of relativity, in which it&#39;s easy to lose your way, assuming you have the courage to enter in the first place.
But to the intrepid, three experimental paths lie open.


The first is in null checks of extreme precision&mdash;accuracies of 1 part in 10<sup>11</sup> and a few parts in 10<sup>23</sup> are involved in two such experiments discussed here&mdash;which seek to balance against each other two quantities that are expected from existing theory to be equal.
The magnitude of any inequality discovered sets clear limits to theory.
A second kind of experiment seeks more accurate checks than are presently available for the three famous predictions of Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity which ties gravitation to curved space&mdash;the gravity -induced red shift, bending of light, and precession of Mercury&#39;s orbit.
The third experimental approach has generated most industrial interest lately, because it seems to point to the possibilities&mdash;remote ones&mdash;of communication by gravity and of shielding against gravity.
This approach asswnes the existence of gravity waves analogous to electromagnetic radiation, as predicted by Einstein, and seeks to find them.&mdash;S.T.

&squf; There has been until recently what we might term a psychological lull in matters gravitational.
Perhaps this was only to be expected after the early great labors in the long history of gravity studies.
Our present ideas about it are most completely crystallized in Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation and his three laws of motion, and in Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity and its modern extensions (see &ldquo;The Dynamics of Space-Time,&rdquo; page 11).
Yet this lull would be easier for us to understand if the field really was &ldquo;cleaned up&rdquo; by these theoretical achievements.
It is not, of course.
In many fundamental respects gravitation still offers all the exploratory challenges of a field that&#39;s just beginning.


### The feeble force called gravity


The nature of the challenge and the main barrier to possible rewards arises from the fact that gravity is the weakest force now known.
The ratio of the gravitational force to the electrostatic force between a proton and an electron in an average atom is only about 5&times;10<sup>&minus;0</sup>.
If the diminutive size of this number is hard to comprehend, here&#39;s another analogy that may help.
The electrostatic force of repulsion between two electrons 5 meters apart&mdash;a scant 10<sup>&minus;24</sup> dynes}&mdash;approximately equals the gravitational force exerted by the entire earth on one of the electrons.
The extremely small magnitude of gravitational forces has led many technical people to feel that, while gravitation may be interesting from a philosophical standpoint, it&#39;s unimportant either theoretically or experimentally in work concerned with everyday phenomena.
This feeling may be justified, of course.
In fact, on a slightly more sophisticated level, application of the strong principle of equivalence seems at first to reinforce this point of view. 


This principle tells us that the effects of gravitational forces on observations can be transformed away by making the observations in a laboratory framework that is properly accelerated.
The best concrete example of this still is Einstein&#39;s original freely falling elevator in a gravity field, in which an experimenter and all his apparatus are placed.
Since he and his apparatus fall with the same acceleration, gravitational effects apparently disappear from phenomena observed in the elevator.
Gravitational forces, in other words, sometimes simulate inertial ones.
From this it&#39;s easy to conclude that gravitation is of little or no concern.


This is probably too provincial a point of view.
Our little laboratories are embedded in a large universe and thinking scientists can hardly ignore this external reality.
The universal character of gravitation shows that it affects all matter, in ways we have yet fully to comprehend.
For all we know now, gravitation may play a dominant role in determining ultimate particle structure. And our laboratories&mdash;freely falling or otherwise&mdash;may be tossing about on &ldquo;gravitational waves&rdquo; without our knowing it.


Gravitational waves represent the energy which should be radiated from a source&mdash;any source&mdash;composed of masses undergoing accelerated motion with respect to each other.
Such waves&mdash;if they exist as called for in Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity&mdash;should exert forces on objects with mass, just as elastic waves do in passing through an elastic medium, or as ocean waves do when striking the shore.
An athlete exercising with dumbbells or riding a bicycle, however, would radiate away an incredibly small amount of such energy.
A pair of white dwarf stars, on the other hand, with a total mass roughly equal to that of the sun, and with each star rotating at enormous speed with respect to the other in a binary or double-star system, might radiate about 2&times;10<sup>87</sup> ergs/sec of energy as gravitational waves.
This is 5000 times the amount of energy contained in the sun&#39;s optical luminosity, and far from negligible if it occurs, but in order to decide whether gravity and gravitational waves are significant or not we must learn more about them.
And to do this we must subject our most profound physical theories concerning them to critical scrutiny.
The moment we do we find that these theories rest upon an exceedingly small number of significant experimental measurements, and that many of these measurements are of dubious precision.


### Profound theories with shaky foundations

Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity (usually abbreviated by physicists as GTR, to distinguish it from many other relativistic theories of gravitation) is, of course, the prime example.
The key idea expressed by the theory, relating gravitation to a curvature of space, is an elegant one despite the tensor language which makes it difficult for many to understand.
It reduces to the more generally comprehended Newtonian form in most cases where measurements can be made.
And further contributions to its tacit acceptance by most present-day physicists have come from the experimental checks of Einstein&#39;s three famous predictions made on the basis of it: the gravitational redshift of light, the gravitational bending of light, and the precession of the perihelion of the orbit of the planet Mercury.
We have in GTR a widely accepted theory, elegant beyond most others, based on very little critical evidence.

### Strategy and tactics in experimentation

How can we remedy this lack?
What can the earth-bound experimenter do to investigate the nature of gravitation?
Most often, in view of the extreme weakness of the force, he will need to use as his power source astronomical bodies which have sufficiently strong gravitational fields.
Instead of a laboratory experiment in which all of the significant variables are under his control, some or all of the effects he seeks may be associated with planetary systems, stars, galaxies, or the universe as a whole.
Two examples of this approach (to which we&#39;ll return) are the Princeton group&#39;s recent refinement of the classic E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment, which used the sun as a source of a gravitational field, and Weber&#39;s suggested study of elastic oscillations in the earth, on the idea that they may be caused by gravitational waves coming, perhaps, from an exploding supernova.


There are roughly three categories into which experiments on gravitation may be placed.
First and most important are highly precise null experiments, such as the classic experiment devised by the Hungarian nobleman and physicist Baron von E&ouml;tv&ouml;s.
By balancing on a torsion balance the inertial forces arising from the earth&#39;s rotation against gravitational forces due to the earth&#39;s mass (Fig. 1-1) he was able to show to a precision of a few parts in 10* that all materials and masses fell with the same acceleration.
This was an amazing accuracy for his day, and one that two of us (Roll and Dicke) have had to work hard for several years to improve by just two orders of magnitude!
Null checks of this sort seek to balance against each other two quantities, which are expected from GTR to be equal or almost equal, in order to obtain an upper limit on the magnitude of any inequality and thus place clear limits on the applicability of the theory.


The second experimental category seeks to improve the accuracy of the three experimental verifications of the predictions of GTR mentioned above.
These values can and should be improved as we&#39;ll show later.
But limited as they are, they do provide valuable insights into the kind and number of fields associated with the all-pervading force called gravity.


The third class of experiments deals with gravitational radiation.
In 1916 Einstein studied the approximate solutions of his gravitational-field equations and concluded that gravity waves ought to exist.
But only recently has it become technologically possible even to attempt to detect the minute effects of such waves in the laboratory, as is being done by the Maryland group with equipment like that shown in Fig. 1-2.


What we&#39;ve said so far suggests that experimental programs in gravity and relativity exist at only two places&mdash;Princeton and Maryland.
That very nearly is the case.
Miscellaneous experiments, some highly important, have of course been carried out elsewhere; we&#39;ll mention one of them later on.
And the air in recent years has turned thick with glamorous proposals for &ldquo;critical&rdquo; one-shot experiments. But&mdash;to our knowledge&mdash;no other institutions in the world are following a consistent and continuing experimental program guided by the rigorous theoretical framework which guides our efforts.


The null-experiment program at Princeton, for instance, considers Einstein&#39;s GTR as only one theory in a large class of relativistic theories, any one of which can account for gravitational effects equally well with the limited, low-quality experimental evidence presently available.
Our program aims at narrowing down possibilities in this large class.


### What gravity seems to be

All relativistic requirements suggest that gravitational effects&mdash;like electromagnetic ones&mdash;are due to the interaction of matter with one or more of three kinds of classical field.
(1) Matter could interact with a scalar field.
Perhaps the most familiar such field is the sound field associated with fluctuations in air pressure.
The air pressure itself is a scalar quantity, a number whose value at any point is independent of the coordinates used to label the point.
(2) Matter could interact with a vector field.
A familiar three-dimensional example of this is a flowing fluid, in which the streaming velocity at each point is a vector quantity.
(3) Matter could interact with one or more tensor fields.
The stress distribution in an elastic body is one example of a simple three-dimensional tensor field.
The stress at any point in the body has no single value, but varies with the direction considered.
For this reason we must specify six quantities to characterize the stress at each point.
More exactly, the scalar, vector, and tensor fields which concern us are all in four-dimensional space, and they cannot be as readily visualized as in these three-dimensional examples.

The classic E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment and the recent Princeton version of it that raised its accuracy two orders of magnitude, both shown above, prove that all masses fall with the same acceleration to within the accuracies achieved.
This result is necessary&mdash;but not sufficient by itself&mdash;to validate the theory of general relativity which ascribes gravitational interactions to tensor field interactions in curved space.

Detection cylinder is 2 ft in diameter &times; 6 ft long, and is suspended on acoustic bricks to null out extraneous vibration.
Wiring leads to piezo-electric quartz sensors embedded in detector, that convert its oscillations to voltages.
The hope is that if gravity waves with frequencies near the natural frequency of the detector (1657 cps) impinge upon it, its natural frequency will be reinforced.

In the experimental effort at Princeton we hope to eliminate one or more of these four-dimensional fields&mdash;scalar, vector, and tensor&mdash;as possible contributors to gravitation.
If we could demonstrate, for example, that all fields could be eliminated except a single tensor field with suitable properties, Einstein&#39;s GTR would receive strong support.
As of this writing, null experiments which have been performed at Princeton and other places do seem to drastically narrow down the number of possible combinations of fields permitted by relativistic theories&mdash;and hence the possible theories themselves&mdash;to a smaller class which still includes the GTR.
Vector fields of any appreciable strength, for example, can be excluded from the gravitational interaction by the Princeton E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment.
And the same experiment appears to exclude more than one scalar field from gravitational interactions.
Arguments based upon another experiment, performed by Vernon Hughes and collaborators at Yale University, appear to exclude more than one tensor field from contributing to gravitational interactions.


Thus, by this unspectacular process of experimental elimination, gravitation is being increasingly revealed as primarily due to a single tensor field, as the GTR requires, although a substantial contribution from a scalar field, which some other relativistic theories permit, cannot yet be excluded.


### Null experiments don&#39;t prove &ldquo;nothin&rdquo;

Of the various null experiments, perhaps the most important is the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment confirming that all masses and all materials have the same gravitational acceleration.
A null result is necessary (but not sufficient) for GTR (and Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation) to be valid.
The most precise version of this experiment, completed recently at Princeton University ([Figure [1-1](#fig1-1) and [1-3](#fig1-3)), showed that the acceleration toward the sun of test masses of gold and aluminum differs by no more than 1 part in 10<sup>11</sup>, an improvement of two orders of magnitude over E&ouml;tv&ouml;s&#39; original experimental precision of 3 parts in 10<sup>9</sup>. 


The results of this experiment are highly significant for ascertaining that various forms of energy (which are related to the inertial mass of a body via Einstein&#39;s well-known formula E = Mc<sup>2</sup>) are indeed equivalent to the gravitational mass of the body.
(The gravitational mass is defined as that property of matter on which gravity acts.)
To see this, consider the energy associated with the strong nuclear forces which bind the atomic nuclei of our gold and aluminum test masses against the disruptive effects of electrostatic repulsive forces.
Nuclear binding energy makes up 11.0&times;10<sup>&minus;3</sup> of the total mass of a gold atom and 9.7&times;10<sup>&minus;3</sup> of the total mass of an aluminum atom.
Hence, recalling the accuracy of 1 part in 10<sup>11</sup> of the new E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment, its result says that&mdash;to within about 1.3 parts in 10<sup>8</sup>&mdash;the gravitational acceleration of the inertial mass (which is equivalent to nuclear binding energy) is the same as the gravitational acceleration of all the other mass-energy contributions to the total masses of gold and aluminum.
The other contributions come from neutrons, protons, electrons, electrostatic energy, and other still smaller contributors to the total mass of an atom.
Moreover, since gold and aluminum atoms differ not only in nuclear binding energy and total mass, but also in many other significant respects&mdash;such as total electron mass, electron binding energy, nuclear electrostatic energy, and energies concentrated in the electron-positron pair field surrounding the nucleus&mdash;similar arguments may be advanced to set small upper limits on any nonequivalence among all of these different forms of energy in their gravitational interactions.


So the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment establishes with considerable precision a different form of the principle of equivalence than the strong one we discussed earlier; it establishes a weak form which states that gravitational acceleration is the same for all important contributions to the mass-energy of a small body like an atomic nucleus.


But what of the strong version of this same principle, upon which GTR is founded?
This requires that the form and numerical content of all physical laws be the same in all freely falling, nonrotating laboratories.
The more precise null result of our E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment verifies the strong principle of equivalence, too, for strongly interacting particles and fields such as the electro-magnetic and nuclear-force fields and their associated particles, positron-electron pairs, and pi mesons.
But the experiment fails to verify the strong equivalence principle for interactions as weak as the universal Fermi interaction (involved in the beta decay of atomic nuclei) or the gravitational interaction itself.


### Tactics of the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment

One of the fundamental differences between the Princeton experiment and that of E&ouml;tv&ouml;s was our use of the gravitational acceleration toward the sun, balanced by the corresponding centrifugal acceleration due to revolution of the earth in orbit about the sun ([Figure 1-1](#fig1-1), bottom).
Although these accelerations are somewhat less than those which E&ouml;tv&ouml;s used&mdash;his were due to the earth&#39;s mass and its rotation on its axis, remember&mdash;ours had the great advantage of appearing with a 24-hour period because, in effect, the sun moves around the earth once each day.
Thus any gravitational anomalies on our torsion balance would have appeared with a sinusoidal 24-hour periodicity.
By recording the rotation or torque on our balance remotely and continuously, then using a digital computer to analyze the record for a 24-hour periodicity with the proper phase, all of the extraneous effects which can produce small torques with other periods or the wrong phase could be discarded.


One additional difficulty with which E&ouml;tv&ouml;s had to contend was the sensitivity of his torsion balance to gradients in the gravitational field, such as those produced by the good Baron himself sitting at the telescope.
The Princeton experiment minimized such problems not only by remote observation ([Figure 1-3](#fig1-3)) but by making the torsion balance triangular in shape, with the two aluminum weights and one gold weight suspended from the corners of a triangular quartz frame.
This threefold symmetry made it insensitive to nonuniformities in the gravitational field.

Fig. 1-3. 
The optical-lever system shown here was used to detect rotation of the triangular torsion balance used in Princeton version of the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s experiment, shown in Fig. 1-1.
Output of the detector had to be fed back to the torsion balance, throvgh an appropriate filter network, in order to damp out long-period non-gravitational disturbances of the torsion balance caused by ground vibrations.
Because balance was suspended in high-vacuum chamber (10<sup>&minus;8</sup> mm) there were no natural mechanisms to damp such extraneous oscillations in periods of time less than several months.

Our torsion balance evolved to its final form over a period of several years, and the final data were obtained between July 1962 and April 1963 in some 39 runs, lasting from 38 to 86 hours each.
We could detect angular rotations of about 10<sup>&minus;9</sup> radians, corresponding to a torque of about 2.5&times;10<sup>&minus;10</sup> dyne/cm, which in turn was 1&times;10<sup>&minus;11</sup> times the gravitational torque of the sun on one of the balance weights.
As you may have discerned, we&#39;re rather proud of our results. 
They were not easy to get; but they buttress our fragile theoretical edifice a bit more firmly.
