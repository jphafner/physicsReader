<span class="textsc">After 1676</span> Newton gave over contending for his theory of colors and withdrew into his alternate posture of renunciation.
&ldquo;I had for some years past,&rdquo; he wrote in 1679, &ldquo;been endeavouring to bend myself from philosophy to other studies in so much that I have long grutched the time spent in that study unless it be perhaps at idle hours sometimes for a diversion.&rdquo;
It is not known in detail how he spent those years.
On theology and biblical antiquities certainly, on mathematics probably, on chemistry and on perfecting his optics perhaps, for it is in character that he should have nursed his disenchantment in public and continued his work in private.
In 1679 he was recalled to science, but to dynamics this time, by a further letter from Hooke, now become Secretary of the Royal Society. 
Hooke approached him on two levels.
Privately, the letter was an olive branch. 
Officially, it was the new secretary bespeaking the renewed collaboration of the most potent of his younger colleagues, sulking in his tent. 


Newton answered, correctly enough in form, but not very frankly, not at all cordially, affecting ignorance of an &ldquo;hypothesis of springiness&rdquo; (Hooke&#39;s law of elasticity) on which Hooke had invited his opinion.
So as to disguise without taking the edge off his snub, he threw in as a crumb &ldquo;a fancy of my own,&rdquo; the solution of a curious problem he had toyed with in one of those idle hours. 
It concerned the trajectory of a body falling freely from a high tower, supposing the earth permeable and considering only the diurnal rotation.
This was in fact a famous puzzle suggested by the Copernican theory, the same problem which Galileo had so curiously and erroneously answered with a semi-circle to the center of the earth.
Since then it had been much discussed in obscure and learned places.
And having brought it up himself, as if to flex a mental muscle in Hooke&#39;s face, Newton gave an answer as wrong as Galileo&#39;s.
The trajectory, he casually said and drew it, will be a spiral to the center of the earth. 


Now, Hooke did not know the right answer.
The forces are in fact complex: the force of gravity increases by the inverse square relationship as far as the surface of the earth and thereafter as the first power of the distance. 
Hooke, along with many others, surmised the former (though he was too feeble a mathematician to handle gravity other than as constant) but was ignorant&mdash;as Newton then was&mdash;of the latter fact.
He did have the happy thought of eliminating Coriolis forces by putting his tower on the equator.
But Hooke did not need to solve the problem correctly to perceive that the initial tangential component of motion will not only, as Newton pointed out with an air of correcting vulgar errors, carry the body east of the foot of the tower, but by the same reasoning will insure that one point which the body can never traverse, either on a spiral or on any other path, is the center of the earth.
Hooke was not the man to resist this opportunity.
He had invited Newton to a private correspondence.
He communicated Newton&#39;s reply to the Royal Society, and corrected his error publicly. 


It would be tedious to follow the ensuing correspondence: the outward forms of courtesy, the philosophical tributes to truth as the goal, the underlying venom, the angry jottings in the margin.
Newton &ldquo;grutched&rdquo; admitting error far more than the time spent on philosophy. 
He never did solve the problem. But he left it as the most important unsolved problem in the history of science. 
For it drew his mind back to dynamics and gravity, back to where he had left those questions thirteen years before.
And in the course of these geometrical investigations, he solved the force law of planetary motion: &ldquo;I found the Proposition that by a centrifugal force reciprocally as the square of the distance a Planet must revolve in an Ellipsis about the center of the force placed in the lower umbilicus of the Ellipsis and with a radius drawn to that center describe areas proportional to the times.&rdquo;
He would prove the point mass theorem only after 1685.
But he had proved the law of gravity on the celestial scale, not just approximately for circular orbits as in 1666, but as a rigorous geometric deduction combining Kepler&#39;s laws with Huygens&#39; law of centrifugal force.
And he told no one, &ldquo;but threw the calculations by, being upon other studies.&rdquo; 


It is one of the ironies attending the genesis of Newton&#39;s <em>Principia</em> that no one knew beforehand of his work on celestial mechanics.
In inviting Newton&#39;s correspondence, Hooke may even have thought that he was taking his rival onto his own ground.
For the problem of gravity was constantly under discussion.
Hooke had certainly surmised that a gravitating force of attraction was involved in the celestial motions, and that it varied in power inversely as the square of the distance.
So, too, had Christopher Wren, then one of the most active of the virtuosi, and the young astronomer, Edmund Halley.
But none of them was mathematician enough to deduce the planetary motions from a force law. 


Far more than Boyle, Hooke was the complete Baconian. 
The only plausible explanation of his later conduct is that he truly did not understand the necessity for mathematical demonstration.
He relied uniquely upon experiment to sort out the good from the bad ideas that crowded out of his fertile imagination.
He seems to have been prepared to build even celestial mechanics out of experiments on falling bodies like those improvised to test out Newton&#39;s spiral.
Nor could he see that the rigorous geometrical demonstrations of the <em>Principia</em> added anything to his own idea.
They gave the same result.
Once again, thought Hooke on seeing the manuscript, Newton had wrapped his intellectual property in figures and stolen it away. 


Halley was more sophisticated.
He was also an attractive and sympathetic young man.
In August 1684 he went up from London to consult Newton.
An account of this visit by John Conduitt, who later married Newton&#39;s niece, is generally accepted.

Without mentioning either his own speculations, or those of Hooke and Wren, he at once indicated the object of his visit by asking Newton what would be the curve described by the planets on the supposition that gravity diminished as the square of the distance.
Newton immediately answered, an Ellipse. Struck with joy and amazement, Halley asked him how he knew it? Why, replied he, I have calculated it; and being asked for the calculation, he could not find it, but promised to send it to him. 
</blockquot>


While others were looking for the law of gravity, Newton had lost it.
And yielding to Halley&#39;s urging, Newton sat down to rework his calculations and to relate them to certain propositions <em>On Motion</em> (actually Newton&#39;s laws) on which he was lecturing that term.
He had at first no notion of the magnitude of what he was beginning.
But as he warmed to the task, the materials which he had been turning over in his mind in his twenty-five years at Cambridge moved into place in an array as orderly and planned as some perfect dance of figures.
Besides proving Halley&#39;s theorem for him, he wrote the <em>Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy</em>.
The <em>Principia</em>, it is always called, as if there were no other principles.
And in a sense there are none. 
For that book contains all that is classical in classical physics. 
There is no work in science with which it may be compared. 


&ldquo;I wrote it,&rdquo; said Newton, &ldquo;in seventeen or eighteen 
months.&rdquo; He employed an amanuensis who has left an 
account of his working habits. 

<blockquote>
I never knew him to take any recreation or pasttime either in riding out to take the air, walking, bowling, or any other exercise whatever, thinking all hours lost that was not spent in his studies, to which he kept so close that he seldom left his chamber except at term time, when he read in the schools as being Lucasianus Professor.
&hellip; He very rarely went to dine in the hall, except on some public days, and then if he has not been minded, would go very carelessly, with shoes down at heels, stockings untied, surplice on, and his head scarcely combed.
At some seldom times when he designed to dine in the hall, [he] would turn to the left hand and go out into the street, when making a stop when he found his mistake, would hastily turn back, and then sometimes instead of going into the hall, would return to his chamber again. 
</blockquote>


Mostly Newton would have meals sent to his rooms and forget them.
His secretary would ask whether he had eaten.
&ldquo;Have I?&rdquo;
Newton would reply.  


The Royal Society accepted the dedication, undertook to print the work, and like a true learned organization found itself without funds.
The expense, therefore, as well as the editing came upon Halley.
He was not a rich man, but he bore both burdens cheerfully, with devotion and tact.
He had the disagreeable task of informing Newton that upon receipt of the manuscript Hooke had said of the inverse square law, &ldquo;you had the notion from him,&rdquo; and demanded acknowledgment in a preface.
Upon this Newton threatened to suppress the third book, the climax of the argument, which applied the laws of motion to the system of the world.
He was dissuaded, as no doubt he meant to be, but one can understand how his feeling for Hooke turned from irritable dislike to scornful hatred: 


<blockquote>
Now is not this very fine?
Mathematicians, that find out, settle, and do all the business, must content themselves with being nothing but dry calculators and drudges; and another that does nothing but pretend and grasp at all things, must carry away all the invention, as well of those that were to follow him, as of those that went before.
Much after the same manner were his letters writ to me, telling me that gravity, in descent from hence to the centre of the earth, was reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the altitude, that the figure described by projectiles in this region would be an ellipsis, and that all the motions of the heavens were thus to be accounted for; and this he did in such a way, as if he had found out all, and knew it most certainly. 
And, upon this information, I must now acknowledge, in print, I had all from him, and so did nothing myself but drudge in calculating, demonstrating, and writing, upon the inventions of this great man.
And yet, after all, the first of those three things he told me of is false, and very unphilosophical; the second is as false; and the third was more than he knew, or could affirm me ignorant of by any thing that past between us in our letters. 
</blockquote>


The provocation was great, as was the strain under which it was given.
A few years after completing the <em>Principia</em> Newton suffered a nervous collapse.
He wrote very strange letters.
One of them accused Locke of trying to embroil him with women&mdash;Newton, who was as oblivious to women as if they were occult qualities.
Alarmed, his friends had arranged a move to London, to bring him more into company.
He gave up solitude in Cambridge with no regrets, became after a few years Master of the Mint, then President of the Royal Society which once he had held at such a haughty distance.
Knighted in 1705 he lived out his years until 1727, the incarnation of science in the eyes of his countrymen, a legend in his own lifetime. 

But he did very little more science.
