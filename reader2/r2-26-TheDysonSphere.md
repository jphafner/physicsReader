To discuss another possible modification of the cosmos by the activities of intelligent beings, consider the following question: Is it possible that in the future&mdash;perhaps the distant future&mdash;man could so change the solar system that his activities would be visible over interstellar distances? 
In Chapter 11, we discussed the difficulties in the detection of planets about even the nearest stars, with present techniques. 
But what of the future? 
Is it possible that someday we shall be able to conclude, from observed characteristics, that a star is accompanied by a planet populated by an advanced technical civilization? 
Let us consider some of the ideas of Constantin Edwardovich Tsiolkovskii, an illustrious Russian pioneer in problems of space exploration. 


Three quarters of a century ago, this remarkable man suggested a plan for the rebuilding and reorganization of the solar system. 
In his book Dreams of the Earth and Sky, published in 1895, he pointed out that the Earth receives only 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>19</sup> of the total flux of solar radiation. 
He speculated that eventually mankind would make use of all the heat and light of the Sun by colonizing the entire solar system. 
Tsiolkovskii suggested that first the asteroids be rebuilt. 
The intelligent beings of the future, he predicted, would control the motion of these small planets &ldquo;in the same way that we drive horses.&rdquo; 
The energy necessary to maintain the inhabitants of the asteroids would come from &ldquo;solar motors.&rdquo; 
Thus, we see that over 70 years ago, Tsiolkovskii predicted the invention of the solar battery, a device which is presently used to provide energy for space vehicles. 


The transformed asteroids would form a chain of space cities. 
The construction materials would initially come from the asteroids themselves, &ldquo;the mass of which would be dismantled in a day.&rdquo; 
&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> Tsiolkovskii&#39;s ideas on the re-engineering and relocation of the asteroids have been echoed in recent years by the American engineer Dandridge Cole, of the General Electric Corporation. 
&#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup--> After the asteroidal material is exhausted, Tsiolkovskii envisions the rebuilding of the Moon. 
He allows several hundred years for this project. 
Then, the Earth and the larger planets would be reorganized. 
According to Tsiolkovskii, the entire transformation of the solar system would require hundreds of thousands&mdash;perhaps millions&mdash;of years. 
This plan would provide enough heat and light to support a population of 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>21</sup> manlike beings&mdash;approximately 10<sup>14</sup> more people than presently inhabit the Earth. 


Although to his contemporaries the daring ideas of Tsiolkovskii seemed to be merely the daydreams of a provincial school-teacher, his brilliant foresight is readily appreciated today. 
The eminent American theoretical physicist Freeman J. Dyson, of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, basing his theories on the achievements of contemporary science, has recently independently repeated many of Tsiolkovskii&#39;s ideas, without knowing anything of the Russian&#39;s work. 

Dyson, in a most interesting article published in 1960, attempted to perform a quantitative analysis of the problem of rebuilding the solar system. 
He first discussed the fact that scientific and technological development takes place very rapidly, after a society has entered its technological phase. 
The timescale of such development is insignificant, compared with astronomical and geological time-scales. 
Dyson concluded that the one important factor which restricts the scientific and technical development of an intelligent society is the limited available supply of matter and energy resources. 
At present, the material resources which can be exploited by man are limited roughly to the biosphere of the Earth, which has a mass &#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> estimated variously between 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;grams and 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;grams&mdash;that is, less than 10<sup>&minus;8</sup> the mass of the Earth. 
The energy required by contemporary mankind per year is approximately equal to that which is liberated in the combustion of 1 to 2 billion tons of hard anthracite coal per year. 
In terms of heat, we find that contemporary man is expending an average of 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;erg per second. 
The Earth&#39;s resources of coal, oil, and other fossil fuels will be exhausted in a few centuries. 


The question of our reserves of matter and energy becomes more acute when we consider the prospective long-term technological development of our society. 
Even if we assume that the average annual growth rate in production is only one-third of a percent (a very small figure, when compared to the annual growth rate &#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> of a few percent in modern industrial societies A), our productivity will double in about a century. 
In 1,000 years, the rate of manufacture will increase by 20,000 times; and in 2,500} years, by 10 billion times. 
This means that the energy requirements in 2,500} years will be 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;erg per second, or approximately 0.01 percent of the entire luminosity of the Sun. 
This figure is approaching cosmic proportions. 
Will all of our energy resources have been exhausted by the time we achieve this level of productivity? 


To answer this question, let us now consider the material resources which are conceivably available to mankind in the future. 
We shall&mdash;perhaps optimistically&mdash;assume that we will be able to achieve controlled thermonuclear reactions. 
The total amount of hydrogen in the Earth&#39;s hydrosphere is approximately 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;grams, while the amount of deuterium is approximately 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>19</sup> grams. 
Deuterium would be the basic fuel of a thermonuclear reactor. 
The amount of energy released by reaction of all the available deuterium would be about 5&nbsp; &times;&nbsp;10<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;ergs. 
In 2,500 years, this amount of energy&mdash;still assuming an increase in production of one-third of a percent per annum&mdash;would be sufficient for only a 50 year period. 
Even if we assume that controlled thermonuclear fusion can eventually be fueled by ordinary hydrogen, and that 10 percent of the world&#39;s oceans can be utilized as an energy source&mdash;to burn more would probably be inexpedient&mdash;in 2,500 years we would be able to provide only enough energy for another few thousand years. 

Another possible energy source would be the direct utilization of solar radiation. 
Each second, approximately 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;erg of solar radiation fall upon the surface of the Earth. 
This is almost 100,000 times more than the current production of all forms of energy. 
Yet it is 100,000 times less than the estimated energy requirements for the year 4500 a.d. 
Thus, direct solar radiation is inadequate to support a stable and sustained increase in production of only one-third of a percent per annum, over a long period of time. 
From this discussion, we can conclude that the energy resources of the Earth are insufficient to fulfill the long-term requirements of a developing technological society. 

Before considering this question further, let us make a slight digression. 
A hypercritical reader may claim that the above calculations are similar to the discussions of the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. 
This is, however, not the case. Malthus predicted that world population growth would outstrip the development of productive forces, and that this would lead to a progressive deterioration of living conditions. 
His proposed solution was that the poorer classes&mdash;that is, the working classes&mdash;lower their birthrate. 
Malthus&#39; views are invalid, because in an intelligent, organized society, the increase of productive forces always outstrips the increase in population. 
The population of a nation is related, sometimes in a complex way, to its productivity, and in fact is ultimately determined by it. 
Our discussion of future energy budgets bears no relation to the Malthusian doctrine. 
We have been discussing only the possibilities of the increase in the productive capacities of a society, which is naturally limited to the material and energy resources available. 

&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> The exponential increase in the population of the Earth during historical times is indicated schematically in Fig. 34-1. 
The required future productive capacity of our society is dramatically illustrated&mdash;assuming no major population self-limitation occurs&mdash;by extrapolation of the curve to the future.
&#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup-->

Let us ask another question: Will there in fact be any appreciable increase in the future productive capability of our society? 
What is the basis for assuming that mankind&#39;s progress will be directly related to an increase in his productive capacity? 

<figure>

</figure>

Perhaps development will be in terms of qualitative, not quantitative, changes. 
These problems are philosophical in nature and cannot be discussed in detail here. 
However, I would like to state that I believe it to be impossible for a society to develop without a concurrent increase in production, both qualitatively and quantitatively. 
If an increase in productivity were eliminated, the society would eventually die. 
Note that if a society were to consciously interrupt its productive development, it would have to maintain a very precise level of production. 
Even the slightest progressive decrease would, after thousands of years reduce the technological potential to essentially nothing. 
Over these timescales, any civilization which consciously resolves to maintain a constant level of productivity would be balancing on a knife-edge. 


Let us now return to the subject of the material resources available to a developing society. 
After reaching a high state of technical development, it would seem very natural that a civilization would strive to make use of energy and materials external to the planet of origin, but within the limits of the local solar system. 
Our star radiates 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;ergs of energy each second, and the masses of the Jovian planets constitute the major potential source of material. 
Jupiter alone has a mass of 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;grams. 
It has been estimated that about 10<sup>41</sup> ergs of energy would be required to completely vaporize Jupiter. 
This is roughly equal to the total radiation output of the Sun over a period of 800 years. 

According to Dyson, the mass of Jupiter could be used to construct an immense shell which would surround the Sun, and have a radius of about 1 A.U.  ( 150 million kilometers).
&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> How thick would the shell of a Dyson sphere be? 
The volume of such a sphere would be <span class="math">4&pi; r<sup>2</sup>S</span>, where <span class="math">r</span> is the radius of the sphere, 1 A.U., and <span class="math">S</span> is its thickness. 
The mass of the sphere is just the volume times its density, <span class="math">&rho;</span>, and the mass available is approximately the mass of Jupiter. 
Thus, <span class="math">4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>&rho;S</span> &approx; 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>30</sup> grams.
Thus, we find that <span class="math">&rho; S</span> &asymp; 200 gm cm<sup>&minus;2</sup> &#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup--> of surface area would be sufficient to make the inner shell habitable. 
We recall that the mass of the atmosphere above each square centimeter of the Earth&#39;s surface is close to 1,000 grams.
&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> If the over-all density of the shell were 1 gram per centimeter cubed or slightly less, the thickness of the shell, <span class="math">S</span>, would be a few meters. 
A Man today, for all practical purposes, is a two-dimensional being, since he utilizes only the surface of the Earth. 
It would be entirely possible for mankind in the future&mdash;say, in 2,500 to 3,000} years&mdash;to create an artificial biosphere on the inner surface of a Dyson sphere. 
After man has accomplished this magnificent achievement, he would be able to use the total energy output of the Sun.
&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> Every photon emitted by the Sun would be absorbed by the Dyson sphere, and could be utilized productively. 
A The inside surface area of the Dyson sphere would be approximately 1 billion times greater than the surface area of the Earth. 
The sphere could sustain a population great enough to fulfill the predictions made by Tsiolkovskii three quarters of a century ago. 


We shall not at this time enter into a discussion of how such a sphere would be constructed, how it would rotate, or how we would guarantee that the inhabitants would not fall into the Sun. 
The fact is that the sphere would have different gravitational characteristics from those of a solid body. 
These problems, although complex, are not the principal problems. 
Dyson himself gave special attention to one interesting circumstance: A number of completely independent parameters&mdash;the mass of Jupiter, the thickness of an artificial biosphere, the total energy of the solar radiation, and the period of technological development&mdash;all, in Dyson&#39;s words,

<blockquote>
have consistent orders of magnitude. &hellip; It seems, then, a reasonable expectation that harring accidents, Malthusian pressures will ultimately drive an intelligent species to adopt some such efficient exploitation of its available resources. 
One should expect that within a few thousand years of its entering the stage of industrial development, any intelligent species should be found occupying an artificial biosphere which completely surrounds its parent star.
</blockquote>

Up to this point, Dyson&#39;s speculations have been essentially the same as those of Tsiolkovskii, but based upon more recent scientific knowledge. 
At this point, Dyson introduces an idea novel &#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> even to Tsiolkovskii A: How will a civilization living on the inner surface of a sphere surrounding its star appear from outside?  Dyson says: 

<blockquote>
If the foregoing argument is accepted, then the search for extraterrestrial intelligent beings should not be confined to the neighborhood of visible stars. 
The most likely habitat for such beings would be a dark object having a size comparable to the Earth&#39;s orbit, and a surface temperature of 200 kelvin to 300 kelvin. 
Such a dark object would be radiating as copiously as the star which is hidden inside it, but the radiation would be in the far infrared, at about 10<sub>&mu;</sub> wavelength. 
</blockquote>

If this were not the case, then the radiation produced by the star inside the shell would accumulate, and produce catastrophically high temperatures. 


Since an extraplanetary civilization surrounded by a Dyson sphere would be a very powerful source of infrared radiation, and since the atmosphere of the Earth is transparent to radiation between <span class="math">8</span> and 13<sub>&mu;</sub>, it would be possible to search for such infrared stars with existing telescopes on the Earth&#39;s surface. 
&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> The sensitivity of contemporary infrared detectors is such that with the use of large telescopes, Dyson spheres could be detected over distances of hundreds of light-years even today. 
However, there is not necessarily any way of distinguishing a Dyson sphere detected at 8&minus;13<sub>&mu;</sub> from a natural object such as a protostar, contracting towards the main sequence, and emitting infrared radiation with the same intensity. 
If the sky were mapped in the infrared for possible Dyson spheres, each radiation source could then be investigated by other techniques for characteristic radiation of an intelligent species&mdash;for example, at the 21 cm radio frequency.
&#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup-->

It is also possible that Dyson civilizations might be detected by existing optical techniques. 

<blockquote>
    Such radiation might be seen in the neighborhood of a visible star, under cither of two conditions: A race of intelligent beings might be unable to exploit fully the energy radiated by their star because of an insufficiency of accessible matter, or they might live in an artificial biosphere surrounding one star of a multiple system, in which one or more component stars are unsuitable for exploitation and would still be visible to us. 
    It is impossible to guess the probability that either of these circumstances could arise for a particular race of extraterrestrial intelligent beings, but it is reasonable to begin the search for infrared radiation of artificial origin by looking in the direction of nearby visible stars, and especially in the direction of stars which are known to be binaries with invisible companions. 
</blockquote>

Dyson&#39;s idea is notable for the fact that it presents a specific example of how the activity of an intelligent society might change a planetary system to such an extent that the transformation would be detectable over interstellar distances. 
But a Dyson sphere is not the only way a civilization can utilize the available energy resources of its planetary system. There are other sources which may be even more effective than the complete utilization of local solar radiation. 


First we shall consider using the mass of the large planets as a fuel for thermonuclear reactors. 
The Jovian planets consist primarily of hydrogen. 
The mass of Jupiter is 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;grams, and the store of energy which would be released from the conversion of this quantity of hydrogen into helium would be approximately 10<sup>49</sup> ergs, a vast amount of energy comparable to that released in a supernova explosion. 
If this energy were liberated gradually, over a long period of time&mdash;for example, at a rate of 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;erg per second, comparable to the present solar luminosity&mdash;it would last for nearly 300 million years, a time span most likely greater than the life of the technical civilization itself. 


Perhaps a highly developed civilization could also use a fraction of its own star as an energy source. 
For example, it might be possible to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; a few percent of the solar mass without any significant decrease in luminosity. 
Certainly, we do not yet know the methods for arranging such a loan, but it would probably be accomplished gradually. 
The conversion of, say, 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;grams of solar hydrogen&mdash;25 times more than the mass of Jupiter&mdash;would provide some 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;ergs, an energy supply adequate to satisfy the requirements of a technical civilization for several billion years. 


It is also conceivable, but much less likely, that such utilization of the mass of a star would occur at a more rapid pace, perhaps regulated so that the lifetime of the star would correspond to the lifetime of the civilization. 
The spectral characteristics of such a star would slowly vary. 
At the time that the star finally was turned off, the civilization would cease to exist.
&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> But while we can imagine such a cosmic Gotterdammerung, it is not likely to be staged often.
&#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup-->

If intelligent use is made of the enormous stores of energy available in the solar system, it would not be necessary to construct a Dyson sphere about the Sun. 
Assume, for example, that half the mass of the Jovian planets were used to construct artificial satellites, the &ldquo;space cities&rdquo; of Tsiolkovskii. 
These cities would be established in orbits close to the Sun. 
We may imagine thermonuclear reactors installed in these satellites and fueled by the remaining material in the Jovian planets. 
This picture preserves the essential direction of the development of a technical civilization envisioned in Dreams of the Earth and Sky, but it adds controlled thermonuclear reactions as an energy source. 


Now given these enormous controlled energy sources, civilizations could expand their activities on a much larger scale. 
We shall presently consider several additional ways in which a civilization might announce its presence over interstellar distances. 
These methods seem fantastic. 
We wish to emphasize that we are not saying that such methods are actually in existence; but the probability of their existence is not zero. 
&#9662;<!--\bigtriangledown--> And what we have encompassed as fantastic has declined progressively with the centuries. 
&#9650;<!--\bigtriangleup--> The fundamental point is that the possibilities open to advanced technical civilizations are almost unlimited.
