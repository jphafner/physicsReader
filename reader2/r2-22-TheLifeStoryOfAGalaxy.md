A fairly coherent picture has been built up of the evolution and life-history of single stars; can we make such a coherent picture of the evolution or life-history of a galaxy? 
At the moment our success is not as clear-cut as in the case of the life-history of a star. 
For example, you have seen in Chapter VI that there can be opposite points of view about the radio stars; in one interpretation two galaxies are colliding; in the other, a single galaxy is splitting into two parts. 
At the moment, we have no physical theory or explanation which could fit this second suggestion. 
In fact, the whole problem of the probable course of evolution of a galaxy is more difficult and complex than for a star.
This is not to say that we shall not solve it in the comparatively near future; after all, the evolution of stars was only poorly understood ten years ago. 
Since then most of the story (Chapters III and IV) has been put together, and who knows what the next ten years will bring to our understanding of the evolution of galaxies. 


Chapter V describes the different kinds of galaxies that we see in the sky: spiral galaxies, irregular galaxies without much structure to them, and the smooth ones that we call elliptical galaxies. 
All these different kinds of galaxies are made up of three components&mdash;gas, dust, and stars. 
There is more gas and dust in irregulars and spirals than in the ellipticals, which have almost none. 
In trying to trace out the life-history of a galaxy, one way to begin is to look for a time sequence between these different kinds of galaxies. 
Might one kind of galaxy change into another? 
If so, which are younger? 
Which are older? 


## From Gas to Galaxy

In Chapter V two alternative cosmological theories were described. 
According to the &ldquo;Big-Bang&rdquo; Theory the universe was created at some definite time in the past; matter was then very much closer together in space. 
Somewhat later all the galaxies might have been formed at one time. 
By contrast, according to the &ldquo;Steady-State&rdquo; Theory, the universe has been about the same all along, and galaxies must be forming now. 
In either case it is likely that the material out of which the galaxies formed was originally all gas, containing no stars or dust, and spread more or less uniformly throughout space. 
If a gas is uniformly spread through space, it tends to &ldquo;clot.&rdquo; 
If any little fluctuation takes place, one region by chance becoming a bit more dense than another, then the denser region tends to grow, attracting to itself more material by gravitational force. 
The clots would grow and might easily turn into galaxies. 


On this basis, we shall sketch in quite general fashion what might be the life-history of a galaxy&mdash;not what can be proved, but what would be reasonable. 
Starting, then, with a gas spread uniformly throughout all space, fluctuations begin to form what we will call &ldquo;proto-galaxies.&rdquo; 
At some stage there will be smaller fluctuations inside a proto-galaxy, and out of these smaller fluctuations stars could form. We will call these &ldquo;first-generation stars&rdquo;&mdash;the first stars to form in a galaxy&mdash;and the gas they formed from might have been pure hydrogen, according to the view that the chemical elements have been built up in the stars, as discussed in Chapter IV. 
The &ldquo;Steady-State&rdquo; Theory, of course, suggests that the gas was not pure hydrogen but had a slight mixture of heavier elements ejected from earlier generations of stars and galaxies that had always been around in space. 


In either case, the gas that formed the first generation of stars in a new galaxy would have very little of the heavier elements. 
It would be mostly hydrogen. 
From the early stages of a star&#39;s life discussed in Chapter IV, we know that the more massive a blob of matter that starts condensing, the faster it will contract under its own gravitation to form a star. 
During contraction, the gas becomes quite hot because of the release of gravitational energy as the gas falls in toward the center. 
Just as gravitational energy is released in the condensation of a star, so gravitational energy will be released in the formation of a galaxy; therefore the gas at an early stage in the proto-galaxy might be quite hot. 


## The Youth of a Galaxy


Because the large, hot, blue stars form rapidly, they will generally be imbedded in thinner gas that has not yet condensed into stars. 
The radiation from these hot stars would cause the gas they are imbedded in to shine quite brightly. 
Patches of glowing gas like this will show up very well in a galaxy and are seen in many irregular and spiral galaxies. 
This is the sort of situation we would expect in a young galaxy, and one that we see in the irregular galaxies shown in Figures V-2 and VII-1. 
There is no pattern; an irregular galaxy is just an unorganized collection of blobs of hot gas shining because they are lit up by massive blue stars imbedded in them.
So we might think that an irregular galaxy would be quite young, though there are possible pitfalls in this suggestion, as noted later on. 


What would happen next in a young galaxy after the first generation of large, hot stars has formed? 
These first, massive stars will go through their life-histories fairly quickly, in the manner described in Chapter III, using up all their nuclear fuel. 
Ten or twenty million years later, at the end of their lives, they should turn into white dwarfs, but they are each so massive that the whole star cannot shrink to a white dwarf without losing a large part of its mass. 
So these first-generation stars would have to put back into the interstellar material of the galaxy a good deal of the material of which they were made. 
And this material will have become enriched in the chemical elements &ldquo;cooked up&rdquo; in the interiors of the stars: elements such as helium, carbon, nitrogen, and iron.

Some of these heavier elements, once they get out into the space between the stars, can stick together and form dust grains, which pure hydrogen cannot do. 
(Two hydrogen atoms can stick together in a hydrogen molecule, but these molecules will not form solid dust particles.) 
And, once the oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and so on, make dust grains, the gas, now with a mixture of dust in it, can cool. 
We saw that, in the early history of a galaxy, the gas would be hot; once some dust has formed, the gas can cool because the dust helps the gas to radiate away its heat energy. 
As the gas in a galaxy becomes cool, the pressure drops and it can fall together&mdash;condense under its own gravitational attraction&mdash;much more easily and rapidly. 
Thus it is much easier to form the second and later generations of stars from small density fluctuations. 


## Order Produced by Rotation


In Chapter V, it was shown that galaxies rotate about their axes. 
What would happen to an irregular galaxy if it rotates? 
Could it remain irregular? Star formation is going on, gas is contracting under its own gravitation, and the whole assemblage is rotating as well. 
We can expect a symmetrical and orderly structure to be produced from this formless mass of material just as a shapely vase can be made of formless clay. 
It is difficult to make a symmetrical object out of a lump of clay unless you have a potter&#39;s wheel to rotate the clay; then it is quite easy. 
So, we can understand how a galaxy could become more symmetrical-looking from its rotation. 
An irregular galaxy that started out with relatively few massive blue stars, and no pattern whatever in its structure, would gradually begin to take on a regular, symmetrical shape, with more of the mass collected at the center, and a generally circular outline. 
The cooling of the gas left over after the stars form would help this gas to contract toward the central or equatorial plane of the galaxy, and soon all of the gas and dust would lie in a thin layer or sheet in the central plane, as described in Chapter VI. 

%% TODO
While this was happening&mdash;while the new galaxy was shrinking and speeding up its rotation, forming a more regular pattern&mdash;star formation would be going on continuously. 
As each generation of stars forms, the brightest members (which would be the most massive, high-temperature stars) will evolve and go through their lives most rapidly, come to the end stage, and return most of their substance to the space between the stars. 
But each generation will also contain some stars with a small mass. 
These small-mass stars, stars like our sun or smaller, with very long lifetimes, will not complete the full cycle that the hot bright stars go through&mdash;the cycle from dust to dust and gas to gas. 
Therefore, there should be a gradual using-up of the material of the galaxy; matter would gradually become locked up in low-mass stars whose lifetimes are so long that they take little part in the interchange between interstellar gas and stars.


## Signs of a Galaxy&#39;s Age


There are also the stellar remains&mdash;skeletons, if you like&mdash;the white dwarfs left over after the massive stars have gone through their life cycle.
An increasing fraction of the material of the galaxy will gradually get locked up in the form of white dwarfs; and that fraction can take no further part in the interchange between interstellar gas and stars. 
Thus, the gas in a galaxy will gradually get used up, until eventually there will be none left to form any new stars; in such an aged galaxy we expect only fairly cool stars of small mass, a few red giants into which such stars evolve, and some white dwarfs.


All this suggests that there are indicators of the evolutionary age of a galaxy&mdash;things which could be observed and measured from a large distance.
We need features that can be measured from great distances if we are to get information about a large part of the universe, and about conditions billions of years ago&mdash;for we see the distant galaxies as they were then. 
We could measure, in the first place, the color of a galaxy. 
In Chapter II we saw how the colors of stars can be measured; the colors of galaxies, which are whole collections of stars, can be measured in the same way. 
If a galaxy has a red color it is likely to be made up mostly of old stars all of which have a reddish color&mdash;stars of a smaller mass than the sun and the red giant stars into which they would evolve.
On the other hand, a young, irregular galaxy would have a bluer color because it is largely made up of hot, blue stars. Color thus would be an indicator of the evolutionary age of a galaxy. 


We can also measure the spectrum of a galaxy, made up of the spectra of all the stars in it&mdash;an average or composite spectrum that might reveal the kinds of stars that make up a galaxy.

Another thing to measure is the mass of a galaxy, determined by studying how fast it is rotating (Chapter V). 
Having measured the mass of a galaxy, and the total light it puts out, we can determine the ratio: the mass divided by the luminosity. 
If we do this for a single star&mdash;the sun, for example&mdash;we get a certain value of tons mass per billion kilowatts of radiation. 
For a star cooler than the sun we find that the mass divided by the light is a larger number because of the way in which the luminosity depends so strongly on mass (Chapters III and IV). 
Stars of low mass put out relatively very little light, whereas stars of high mass are much more spendthrift of their energy. 
Hence the mass of a galaxy divided by its luminosity is a fairly good indication of the average kind of stars in that galaxy. 
Of course, it would be better if we could actually study the individual stars, but unfortunately galaxies are so far away that we can only study the brightest individual stars in a few of the nearest ones. 
What we need is a great deal of information about a very large number of galaxies. 


A galaxy that we might think of as being at a somewhat later stage in its life history is shown in Figure I-10. 
This spiral galaxy still has many bright patches in it which we find to be patches of hot gas lit by bright stars. 
These are spread all through it, just as they are spread through an irregular galaxy. 
But this spiral has a clearly defined center, a fairly circular outline, and characteristic spiral arms. 
The color of a spiral like this is a little redder than an irregular galaxy, and from its composite spectrum it seems to have a higher proportion of yellow stars like the sun than does an irregular galaxy. 
All of this indicates that a loose spiral galaxy is at a later stage in its life-history than an irregular one. 
Figure V-1 shows a tighter spiral galaxy (M31) where things have settled down and become still more orderly. 
M31 looks quite tidy; it has a nice bright little center, then a smooth region, and then the spiral arms neatly wound. Even in a galaxy like M31 there are many patches of gas not yet condensed into stars, which are lit up by nearby hot stars. 


## Factors that May Influence the Evolution of Galaxies

Finally, the elliptical galaxies in Figure V-4 are quite smooth.
They are much brighter in the center than in their outer parts but they have no bright patches of gas, and seem to be made up entirely of stars. 
All the gas has been used up. 
Elliptical galaxies have the reddest color of all, and their composite spectra show that their stars are, on the average, low-mass stars like the sun and the red giants into which such stars evolve. 
What about the ratio of mass to luminosity? 
Unfortunately, we do not have much information yet on the masses of elliptical galaxies, but the average for a few shows that they have a much higher ratio of mass to luminosity than the spiral and irregular galaxies. 
This again suggests that they are at a later stage in their life-history. 


Can we now say that an irregular galaxy will turn into a spiral galaxy and, when all the gas is used up, the spiral will turn into an elliptical galaxy? Can we say that we have an evolutionary sequence, irregular types evolving into spirals, and spirals evolving into ellipticals? 
Harlow Shapley, the famous Harvard astronomer, first suggested about a decade ago that this was happening. 
But we must keep in mind the warning example set by studies of the evolution of stars. 
We know that there are many different kinds of stars in the sky, but that we cannot put all these stars into one evolutionary sequence; we have seen in Chapter IV that the life-histories of stars of different masses are very different. 
In fact, if we want to make sense of the life-history of stars, we have to sort the stars first into groups with the same age but different masses. 
We cannot say that a high-temperature, massive star will evolve into a star like the sun. 
But in this first attempt at the life-history of a galaxy we are trying to arrange all the different kinds of galaxies in a single evolutionary sequence. 
Perhaps this is not right&mdash;perhaps the mass of a galaxy plays an important role in determining its life-history, just as the mass of a star is very important in its life-history. 


Although we know the masses of only a few galaxies as yet, it does seem that irregular galaxies and spiral galaxies are, on the average, less massive than elliptical galaxies. 
How, then, could an irregular galaxy become a spiral galaxy and then an elliptical galaxy, with an increase in mass? 


There is further evidence from the double galaxies&mdash;galaxy twins, so to speak. 
For instance, the irregular galaxy M82 lies quite close in space to the large spiral galaxy, M81, and may have been formed out of the same general patch of material. 
It ought to have the same age, just as the stars in any one cluster are likely to have the same age. 
Is the irregular galaxy M82 the same age as the spiral galaxy M81 near it? 
M82 is probably a little less massive than the spiral galaxy M81, but it is rotating, and before very long it should surely settle down to a spiral structure. 
Why is M82 still an irregular galaxy? 
What stopped it from becoming a spiral galaxy like M81?

There must be other factors, then, that determine the way in which a galaxy evolves, beside the mass it had to start with. 
The magnetic field is a possible factor, since magnetic fields are needed (Chapter VI) to explain those galaxies that are radio sources, and it is quite likely that there are magnetic fields in all galaxies, including our own.
These magnetic fields are quite small in comparison to the magnetic field on the surface of the earth that causes a compass needle to point north. 
The magnetic field in our galaxy is only a few hundred-thousandths of this. 
Nevertheless, a magnetic field of this strength spread out through a whole galaxy involves a great deal of energy. 


If magnetic fields are stronger in some galaxies than in others, this might have an effect upon the speed at which interstellar gas could form into stars. 
A strong magnetic field could delay star formation because magnetic fields tend to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; a conducting gas, making it behave more like a solid, and would tend to keep apart a blob of gas that was about to contract under its own gravitation into a star. 
In this way the magnetic fields in a galaxy may be important in determining its life-history. 


Another factor that might be important is the original density of the gas that contracted to form a galaxy. 
Suppose gas is contracting, and that, before it has achieved high average density, some fluctuations initiate star formation. 
This might lead to a slower over-all rate of formation than if all the gas forming a galaxy collapsed at once, reaching high density throughout before the first generation of stars formed. 

## The Origin of S-Zero (S0) Galaxies

Another objection to the idea that a spiral galaxy may turn into an elliptical one is connected with rotation. 
Looking at a spiral galaxy edge-on as in Figure I-11, we see how flat it is. 
Elliptical galaxies are never that flat. 
Once a galaxy has become extremely flat, it is difficult to see how it can round out again, as would be necessary if a spiral galaxy were to evolve into an elliptical galaxy. 
However, there is a kind of galaxy that has no spiral arms and yet is more flattened than the elliptical galaxies, and these are called So galaxies (see Chapter V). 
There are many galaxies of this sort in some of the giant clusters of galaxies, and it has been suggested that they were formed by chance collisions. 
In such a collision the stars of each galaxy just pass each other, simply because there is so much empty space between them.
But the interstellar gas and dust clouds in the two galaxies will collide, and be separated from the stars. 
So collisions will sweep the gas out of spirals. 
S-zero galaxies, which are flat but have no interstellar clouds, might therefore be either the results of collisions between spiral galaxies, or simply aged spiral galaxies that have used up their gas and dust in forming stars. 


<em>Figure V1I-2</em> shows an S0 galaxy in which a small amount of gas remains. 
You can see that there is a very thin line of dust through the center, the region where the spiral arms used to be. 
The gas that makes spiral arms is mostly gone, leaving just stars and the remnants of stars. 


## Winding Up of Spiral Arms

Let us now consider the spiral arms in galaxies. 
They are fairly symmetrical, and this has a bearing on how they might be &ldquo;wound up.&rdquo; 
The central region of a galaxy rotates faster than the outer regions. 
An early idea about the formation of spiral arms, known as the &ldquo;coffee-cup&rdquo; theory, was based on the analogy of a cup of coffee stirred near the middle of the cup. 
The central part of the coffee goes around faster than the outer parts, and at the rim of the cup the coffee is not moving at all. 
A little thick cream poured in makes beautiful spiral arms, and it does not matter what shape the blobs of cream start with; the different speeds of rotation will spin them out into spiral shapes.

    Compare it with Figure I-9 to see why the stars of the Milky Way are considered to form a similar object&mdash;a galaxy.

</figure>


It is easy, then, to understand how spiral arms are formed by the different rates of rotation in a galaxy; the difficulty is just the opposite: why don&#39;t all galaxies have much more extended spiral arms? 
If the galaxies are very old they must have rotated a great many times; an average galaxy will rotate, about halfway out from its center, once in perhaps a hundred million years, and will turn a large number of times in its full life (estimated to be ten billion years). 
We would expect to see spiral arms completely wound up in hundreds of turns, whereas the actual spiral galaxies (Figures I-10, V-1, V-3) usually have arms making just one or two turns. 
It seems that there must be some process that renews or preserves short spiral arms; otherwise the observed rotations of galaxies would wind them out of existence. 
Here again, it is tempting to assume that magnetic fields stiffen the material of a galaxy and prevent a spiral arm from winding up too far. 
They may also play some part in the formation or renewing of spiral arms. 


In addition to the ordinary spiral galaxies, as noted in Chapter V, there is the class of &ldquo;barred spirals&rdquo;&mdash;galaxies that have a bar across the center and two spiral arms starting from the ends of the bar {Figure V-3). 
The bar in such a galaxy rotates more or less like a solid wheel, but just beyond the end of the bar the material rotates more slowly so that the arms get trailed out. 
Something must &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the straight bar into a rigid form so that it does not wind up into spiral arms. 
But Figure VII-3 shows a different sort of barred spiral. 
It has a bar and two large spiral arms, but in the very center there is another little spiral, which turns out to be rotating very fast. 
It is hard to see how the bar could last very long without getting wound up in the central spiral. 
There are several other barred spirals like this, and there is a great deal to be learned before we can hope to understand them.

## Are Galaxies Forming Now?

Finally, do we see any galaxies that we think are really young&mdash;actually young in years? 
The &ldquo;Steady-State&rdquo; cosmological theory predicts that we should see some galaxies formed very recently; the &ldquo;Big-Bang&rdquo; Theory, although it does not say that there could be no young galaxies, must explain them in some special way. 
Figure VII-4 shows one of the few galaxies we can claim are fairly young. 
It is a very odd thing&mdash;an ordinary elliptical galaxy accompanied by nearby patches of gas that must have bright, hot stars in them. 
A galaxy like this could not last very long in its present stage; perhaps this elliptical galaxy, moving through space, captured some left-over material&mdash;a blob of gas in which no stars had formed. 
As a result of the capture, this blob of gas could contract a little, until it was dense enough in some places for stars to form. 
That is, a young galaxy was formed in the presence of an old one. 


<em>Figure VII-5</em> shows two galaxies rather far away from us and located in one of the big clusters of galaxies, the Coma cluster.
A long tail sticks out of the upper galaxy, and another tail from the lower one. 
You would think such tails must wind up; a tail cannot remain just sticking out into space from a galaxy if that galaxy is rotating at all. 
And these galaxies are rotating rapidly, as measured by Doppler shifts in their spectra (see Chapter II). 
That is, a straight, protruding tail makes it very likely that such a galaxy is very young.

    Its shape gives an impression of rotation, but since it takes hundreds of millions of years to turn once around, we cannot hope to detect changes in this view during one man&#39;s lifetime, or even during the whole history of astronomy.

Another queer thing is shown in Figure VII-6; it looks unlike the galaxies we are used to and yet it certainly is a galaxy. 
It has two strings of material and a kind of loop. 
One would expect such an unstable structure soon to change; hence it is also likely to be young. 


In summary, it is difficult to understand in detail how one sort of galaxy can evolve into another, yet in a general way we know that it must happen. 
We know that the stars in a galaxy are ageing (Chapters III and IV), and that the shapes of certain galaxies (Figures VII-5 and VII-6) cannot last, as the motions in each galaxy go on&mdash;motions we have measured by Doppler shifts. 
This reasoning leads us to think that elliptical galaxies are older than spirals and irregular galaxies. 
But if we go on to say that all irregular galaxies turn into spirals after 100 million years, and that all spirals turn into ellipticals after a billion years, how can we explain mixed groups or close pairs of one spiral with one elliptical? How can elliptical galaxies be heavier than spirals? 
(Where did the added mass come from as a galaxy aged?)

One possible explanation is that ageing does not always proceed at the same rate. 
Perhaps in the &ldquo;young&rdquo; spirals we see among &ldquo;old&rdquo; ellipticals, something prevented for a long time the formation and ageing of stars. 
Perhaps the mass of a galaxy has an effect on how rapidly it ages, so that most of the heavy ones have already become &ldquo;old&rdquo; ellipticals. 
Irregular &ldquo;young&rdquo; galaxies seen close to &ldquo;older&rdquo; spirals or elliptical galaxies suggest that, whatever the cause, evolution goes on at different rates in different galaxies even when they are located close to each other in space. 
Two close galaxies in a double may be at widely different stages in their life-histories, even though they have the same age in years. 
In fact, there could well be many even younger galaxies that we cannot see&mdash;dark blobs of matter in which stars have not yet formed because of magnetic fields or low density or some other peculiar condition. 
These ideas of the evolution of galaxies can be fitted equally well into either the &ldquo;Big-Bang&rdquo; Theory or the &ldquo;Steady-State&rdquo; Theory. 


From all this you can see that we do not have an adequate theory of how galaxies evolve. 
More observations and much more theoretical study is needed. 
The subject of evolution of galaxies is a field in which we can expect great changes in the next few years.
