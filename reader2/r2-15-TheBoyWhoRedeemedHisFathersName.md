<blockquot>
With a homemade telescope that cost only $22.32, Kaoru Ikeya searched the skies for 109 nights, until he made a discovery that brought honor to his family
</blockquot>

As she had done many times, Mrs. Ikeya woke when her son Kaoru did and, unnoticed by him, saw him preparing for sky-watching.
All the other children, stretched out beside her on the <em>tatami</em> matting, slept soundly under their quilts.
Only her eldest son, mainstay of this fatherless house, refused to take his full rest before going to work the next morning.
Winter nights are cold in Japan.
Moving quieUy, Kaoru drew on his leather windbreaker, heavy work pants, wool scarf and gloves.
Carrying his bed quilt with him, he left the house to climb an outside ladder to his rooftop perch beside his telescope.


Mrs. Ikeya closed her eyes and tried to go back to sleep, but couldn&#39;t.
Instead, she lay listening to the bitter wind as it swept in from the Pacific and blew across Lake Hamana, just outside the door.


No matter how bizarre his behavior might seem to others, Mrs. Ikeya felt that she owed her son understanding and acceptance.
Yet when she saw him, pale, too thin, and haggard from lack of sleep, she often had to stifle a protest.


By this night of January 2, 1963, 19-year-old Kaoru Ikeya had logged a total of 335 hours and 30 minutes of observing the sky in a period of 109 nights; and there had been countless nights before he began his official log.
Yet each time he peered through the eyepiece of the telescope he had made with his own hands, his pulse quickened in expectation.
Kaoru had set himself a goal. More than anything else, he wanted to be the discovered of a new comet.

Kaoru adjusted the eyepiece and almost at once sighted in the sky a misty object he had never noticed before.
He consulted his sky maps.
They showed nothing in that location.
Thoroughly roused, he rechecked its position meticulously, then remained glued to his telescope, half-convinced that what he was seeing must be a delusion.
But the small, round, diffuse glow remained in the sky, and observing its gradual movement among the stars, Kaoru positively identified it not as a faint star cluster but a coma, the head of a comet.


But was it his comet?
Or was he witnessing the return of a comet already recorded?
Only when the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory had checked out his data would he know whether he had made a discovery.


Next morning Kaoru waited outside the telegraph office before it opened to dispatch a wire to the observatory reporting the comet&#39;s position three degre southwest of star Pi in the constellation Hydra, its 12th-magnitude brightness and its direction of movement.
Then, mounting his bicycle, he pedaled off to work.

Before the whistle blew at 8 a.m., hundreds of workers from surrounding towns had parked their bicycles within the gates of the huge plant of the Kawai Gakki Company, manufacturers of pianos.
In visored cap and factory coveralls, Kaoru Ikeya, a slight figure standing five feet four inches and weighing a bit under 125 pounds, was at once absorbed into the anonymity of the assembly fine, where as an ungraded, or unskilled, worker he polished the white celluloid sheaths for piano keyboards at a salary of 13,000 yen, or about \$35, per month.
But Kaoru&#39;s thoughts were not on factory work.
He had refused special training to upgrade himself at the piano company, and once again he was grateful that his job demanded so little of him Polishing celluloid was mechanical; he could think of other things.


&ldquo;A steady fellow,&rdquo; his personnel card read.
&ldquo;Reliable Quiet.
Middle school education only.
Nonparticipant in company sports or hobby clubs. &hellip; Lacks ambition and initiative.&rdquo;


Within a few days after Kaoru received his reply wire from the Tokyo Observatory, the international news services were flashing quite another profile:


&ldquo;Self-taught 19-year-old amateur astronomer Kaoru Ikeya, using a reflector telescope he constructed by himself at a cost of $22.32, has discovered the New Year&#39;s first comet, officially designated Comet
Ikeya 1963a and now the subject of observation and tracking by astronomers in both hemispheres.&rdquo;

A spate of publicity greeted Kaoru&#39;s discovery. 
His home was invaded by news photographers; he was led before TV cameras and radio hookups; he received more than 700 letters from amateur astronomers seeking his advice; he &ldquo;was awarded a gold medal by the Tokyo Observatory; and he watched in polite silence a professional actor portray him in a hackneyed, melodramatic version of his life story, an &ldquo;inspirational&rdquo; 40-minute movie short called Watching the Stars, which was to be shown to the school children of Japan.


Aglow with pride at the honors heaped on her son, Mrs. Ikeya saw the film through rose-colored glasses.


But Kaoru did not share her bias. 
&ldquo;This movie is a novel, a fiction about me,&rdquo; he commented wryly. &ldquo;Why isn&#39;t the truth good enough?&rdquo;


The truth was neither hackneyed nor melodramatic.
To begin with, if his father had not moved the family from the large industrial city of Nagoya to the town of Bentenjima when Kaoru was six years old, Kaoru would probably have acquired a city boy&#39;s indifference to the sky, observing it only in bits and patches between buildings. 
But their house fronted on Lake Hamana, a salt-water lake fed by the Pacific, and the flat roof offered a perfect platform for observing a far-flung canopy of the heavens. 
As the family grew and Kaoru sought to escape from the noisy clamor of three younger brothers and a sister, he often mounted to the quiet rooftop to look at the stars.


In addition, there were Japanese holidays that had stimulated his interest in the stars. 
For as long as he could remember, he had joined with other boys and girls in hanging strips of colored papers bearing poems and pictures on stalks of bamboo that had been set up outdoors. 
These were directed to the two celestial lovers, the Weaver Star and the Cowherd Star, who, so the story goes, live on either side of the Milky Way and meet only once a year, on the night of the festival.
In the middle of or in late September of each year there was also Tsukimi, a special holiday when all Japan makes offerings of trays of rice dumplings and clusters of seven autumn flowers to the new full moon. 

<br />
<span class="textsc">By the time he was 11 years old Kaoru was highly &ldquo;sky conscious.&rdquo;
He was so enthralled with the mystery of the heavens that he had begun to look for books in his school library that would tell him more about the stars, and to trace maps and diagrams of the skies into his school notebook. 
Tentatively at first, then widi deepening familiarity, he began to distinguish among the galaxies and constellations and to wish to see more than he could with his naked eye. 
What fascinated him most were comets, those ghostly celestial bodies so nebulous as to be commonly described in his books as &ldquo;the nearest thing to nothing that anything can be and still be something.&rdquo;
Kaoru made up his mind. 
It was a new comet that he longed to discover&mdash;a comet of his own, with its fuzzy head surrounding a bright nucleus, its long, ephemeral tail pointing away from the sun and its journey through the skies lasting from three to thousands of years.


There was still another holiday that made an impression on Kaoru during his early years. 
Every May 5th, on the national holiday known as Boys&#39; Day, the Ikeya family, along with others among their neighbors who were fortunate enough to have sons, held a special celebration. 
On tall poles next to their houses they displayed el,, (I, streamers In five colors made in the image of Japan&#39;s favorite fish, the river carp. 
Proudly the Ikeya pole flew six carp. one for each son of the house and one foi each parent. 
Poor Fumiko, the sole daughter of the house, was given new dolls to placate her.


Then Mr. Ikeya lined up his sons and exhorted them to grow up to be good citizens. 
In emulation of the carp&#39;s brave, vigorous struggle upstream, he said, they must aspire ever higher in their own lives.


<br />
<span class="textsc">By</span> the time Kaoru was 12 and had had the six years of elementary school, he had determined to build his own telescope. 
Although his father&#39;s fish market was prospering, Kaoru was reluctant to ask him to buy one.
Already diere was tension between them. 
Instead of applying himself to learning the family&#39;s business, his father complained, Kaoru&#39;s head was &ldquo;always in the stars.&rdquo;


Mr. Ikeya was still moored to the old, prewar attitudes. 
&ldquo;Sound sense should show you, my son,&rdquo; he insisted, &ldquo;that astronomy does not belong to our station in life.&rdquo;


How, Kaoru wondered silently, did his father&#39;s annual Boys&#39; Day message square with this contention?
How much higher could one aspire than to the stars?
In contrast to his father, Kaoru was growing up in a postwar Japan heavily influenced by the Americans who occupied the country. 
In response to reforms enacted in the New Education Law of 1947, his teachers from first grade on rejected the old emphasis on passive, rote learning and memorizing. 
Instead, they encouraged questions and discussions and created projects that his father called a foolish waste of time.


<br />
<span class"textsc">The</span> new way also widened Kaoru&#39;s horizons outside the classroom. 
In the spring and fall he was among die hundreds of thousands of school children who took off on excursions to parks, monuments, temples and shrines. 
The Get-To-Know-Japan program, under which the participants were chaperoned by teachers and billeted at hostels and inexpensive inns, was so inexpensive that by contributing pennies into the class travel fund each week, Kaoru could afford to take advantage of it. 


In middle school, where he completed the nine years of compulsory education, Kaoru was a good student, ranking fifth in a class of 50 students. 
But he had no favorite subjects. &ldquo;Except, of course, the one I thought about and worked at by myself,&rdquo; he says.


Astronomy was not taught in middle school, but Kaoru haunted the school library, reading texts on astronomy and studying the principles of optics, physics and chemistry involved in telescope-making. 
With his meager savings he also managed to buy a number of do-it-yourself manuals on how to build a telescope. 
He was barely 14 when, reading an astronomy journal, he came ac toss the name of Dr. Hideo Honda, an ophthalmologist in Nagoya who held monthly meetings for amateur astronomers in his clinic. 

Kaoru wrote to Dr. Honda that he was planning to construct a Newtonian reflector telescope with a 20 cm or 8 inch mirror&mdash;die most popular and feasible for do-it-yourself amateurs. 
Noting that his young correspondent was only 14, Dr. Honda didn&#39;t think the bov would have either the skill or the stamina to see his project through. 
On the other hand, he was reluctant to discourage Kaoru.


&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he replied cautiously, &ldquo;that you are very likely too young to make a 20 cm mirror. 
Your idea presents many difficulties and I shall tell you all I know about them. 
But so many young men in Japan after the war are impatient, especially with regard to making observations. 
Although many have high-priced tele- scopes, they rarely observe the stars. 
They use their fine instruments only to watch an eclipse of the sun or some other show in the heavens. 
Few of them would be able to take the pains to construct their own instruments.&rdquo;


Kaoru reflected that Dr. Honda could not possibly understand how prepared he really was&mdash;at least to take infinite pains. 
He continued with his studies and gradually began to acquire the materials needed for making his telescope. 
It was at about this time that misfortune struck the Ikeya family.


For some time Mr. ikeya&#39;s fish market had been failing. 
The reasons he ascribed to this were &ldquo;price-fixing by ignorant and officious Japanese and American policy makers,&rdquo; but also, he pointed out, it was retribution by the gods, who were angered by the way Shinto beliefs were being shunted aside.


Discouraged and embittered, Mr. Ikeya began to lounge about the cafes, drinking sake, increasingly reluctant to face his family or five young children. 
Early in 1958 he resolved his dilemma by disappearing, abandoning them all.


Perhaps nowhere else in the world does a father&#39;s desertion so cruelly punish those he leaves behind as in Japan, where the concept of on heavily influences individual behavior. 
<em>On</em> refers to the obligations each person incurs through contact with others by the mere fact of his existence. 
The most basic form of <em>on</em> is <em>ko</em>, the obligation to one&#39;s parents for the daily care and trouble to which they are put; even by offering un- wavering loyalty, obedience and reverence, no more than one ten-thousandth of this debt can ever be paid.
This particular duty, ko, also imparts the same obligations to descendants. 
A Japanese proverb says: &ldquo;Only after a person is himself a parent does he know how indebted he is to his own parents.&rdquo;
It follows, then, that a significant part of <em>ko</em> is to one&#39;s own parents in giving as good or better care to one&#39;s children.


In deserting his family, Mr. Ikeya not only failed utterly in his duty as a parent but violated his most sacred on of filial duty to his own parents. 
He placed an oppressive burden of shame on them all and tarnished the family name, perhaps for generations.


&ldquo;We could think of nothing else, my mother and I,&rdquo; Kaoru says, &ldquo;but that our family was disgraced, our house destroyed.&rdquo;


The first and hardest impact of the disaster was on Mrs. Ikeya.
Sadly Kaoru watched his mother go to work at the hotel near the Bentenjima railroad station, cooking and cleaning for strangers instead of in the seclusion of her own house and family. 
But, as she observed to him, at least the older children were safe in school during the day and she could keep the baby, four-year-old Yasutoshi, with her on the job. 
Although she was under five feet tall and even in her bulky, padded house jacket, trousers and coverall apron looked slight as a sparrow, her strength and fortitude in dealing with this family crisis were immense. 
What she told herself was that the money she earned, around 17,000 yen a month, or about $47, ensured food for her children. 

Kaoru felt the weight of his love and duty toward his mother. 
But until he completed the compulsory third year of middle school he could do no more to lighten her burden than to take a part-time job, rising at five a.m. to deliver morning newspapers before school, then returning after classes to deliver the evening edition. 
Of course, attendance at high school was barred to him. 
The family could not afford either the time or the fees, which amounted to about $25 for registration and about $8 per month.


Mrs. Ikeya&#39;s and Kaoru&#39;s combined efforts were inadequate to keep up payments on their comfortable, roomy house. 
The bank foreclosed and permitted them to move, virtually rent-free, into a far less adequate house a few doors away.


This house provided a narrow entry-way, an all-purpose eating-sleeping-living room, a tiny kitchen, a catchall cubicle and a lavatory at the back. 
But in common with most Japanese houses it was orderly and simple to keep clean, since shoes, which might track up the tatami on which families bed down at night, are never worn inside Japanese houses. 
In the Ikeya home the furniture consisted of a bureau, a square low tabic with floor cushions, Kaoru&#39;s worktable, and two rough shelves that he constructed to hold his small collection of books and manuals. 
No Japanese houses have central heating, and the Ikeyas relied on a large porcelain jar filled with heated charcoal briquets. 
Even well-to-do families have nothing more than a <em>hibachi</em>, a pit in the floor filled with charcoal.


The feature of the house that most concerned Kaoru was the flat roof, which provided as good a platform and as good a sky to view as before. 
On his shoulders rested the responsibility not only of replacing his father as breadwinner and head of the house, but of some-how removing from the family name the stigma his father had attached to it. 
More than ever he thought about his comet. 
What if one day he could attach the dishonored name to the tail of a new comet and write that name across the sky? New comets were generally named after their discoverers.
&ldquo;Comet Ikeya!&rdquo; The name had a fine, proud ring to it!

<br />
<span class="textsc">In</span> June, 1959, when he graduated from middle school, Kaoru was deeply immersed in his thoughts about telescope building, but he paused long enough to get a job at the Kawai Gakki piano Factory, a few miles from home. 
Since degree of education is directly and, on the whole, inflexibly related to earning power in the Japanese economic scale, Kaoru was classified as an ungraded or unskilled worker at base pay.  
Kaoru wasn&#39;t disturbed. 
&ldquo;It&#39;s a simple job,&rdquo; he reported to his mother. 
&ldquo;It will not bother me.&rdquo;


Mrs. Ikeya also was content. 
Although the Japanese are now more concerned with money-making and worldly success than before World War II, with its postwar Western influences, many still place greater emphasis on the reflective life and spiritual values. 
On the practical side of her ledger, Kaoru&#39;s base pay and regular annual raises, together with her own earnings, were enough for the necessities of life. 
Soon, too, Ta- dashi, her second son, only two years younger than Kaoru, would also become a wage earner. 
She didn&#39;t attempt, though, to budget the spiritual side of the ledger. 
She would be a poor mother indeed if she offered Kaoru anything but encouragement and the greatest freedom, within the confines imposed on him by necessity, to follow his own pursuits. 
Who knew?  
Perhaps he would even attain Buddhahood through the ordeals he imposed on himself.


Kaoru set to work grinding the high-precision surface for the main mirror that would go into his telescope. 
Shopping around in secondhand supply stores, he obtained the last-minute materials he needed. 
Bit by bit, and after trial and error, Kaoru, still thinking for himself and going it alone, completed the preliminary work, and then began the final process of assembling and mounting his telescope on the roof. 
In August, 1961, he was ready to begin once more to search the skies. 
Since starting work at the factory he had put nearly two years of off-work hours of labor into achieving his telescope, at a total out-of-pocket cost of 8,000 yen, or about $22.


<br />
<span class="textsc">In</span> Japan, the best hours for viewing are from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., but of course, not every sky is fit for observation. 
On cloudy mornings Kaoru caught up on the sleep he lost during clear mornings, when the predawn spectacles thrilled him. 
He logged his watches meticulously and checked back with his sky maps, but six months after he had begun to search regularly, Kaoru felt deeply discouraged. 
The search for a new comet seemed futile. 
More and more often he began to fall into a mood of profound depression.


&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; Mrs. Ikeya said, &ldquo;you are too much alone with your thoughts. 
Is there no one you could talk to who would give you advice?&rdquo;


Perhaps she was right. 
Kaoru broke out of his solitude to establish communication with someone who had known not only the trials of comet-seeking but also the rewards. 
He wrote to the astronomer Minora Honda, discoverer of nine comets, about his lack of success, pleading between the lines for a word of encouragement.


At first the reply seemed to him almost a rebuff. 
Then, pondering it, Kaoru seized eagerly on its meaning.


&ldquo;To observe the skies solely to seek a new comet is a hopeless task which demands a great deal of time and hard labor,&rdquo; Minora Honda wrote. 
&ldquo;But to observe the brilliant heavens for their own sake without thought of a discovery may bring good luck to your cometseeking. 
You must have humility and not be too ambitious, for, after all, you are quite young and only an amateur.&rdquo;


Kaoru returned to his sky watches. 
He tried to maintain a humbler and more relaxed attitude. 
He still had a great deal to learn about the heavens, and instead of searching for a comet in particular, he concentrated on the whole sky, trying to become as familiar with its plan as he was with the streets and byways of Bentenjima.  


On December 31, 1962, Mrs. Ikeya counted a total of 16 months since Kaoru had begun his night vigils with his new telescope.


&ldquo;Surely, Kaoru,&rdquo; she pleaded, &ldquo;this first night of the holidays you will take your full rest. 
It is Omisoka, after all, the Grand Last Day of the year! 
Both of us have worked hard. 
We have honorably settled all our debts, and can start the new year with a clean record.
Let us stay awake until midnight, listening to the temple bells, and then sleep late in the morning.&rdquo;


To please her, Kaoru didn&#39;t climb to the roof that night, and all through New Year&#39;s Day he remained with the family, enjoying his mother&#39;s holiday meal of ozoni (rice cake soup), playing her favorite game of cards, karuta, and then joining her for a visit to a nearby shrine to pray for good luck in 1963.


It was on the following night of January 2, 1963, while he was still in a relaxed, holiday mood, that Kaoru made his 109th search and discovered his comet.


At the Harvard Observatory, the western hemisphere&#39;s clearinghouse for astronomic information, all the data on Comet Ikeya 1963a, together with a projection of its orbit, were placed on announcement cards and sent to observatories, journals of astronomy and a network of professional and amateur astronomers around the world.  


The comet changed its form and brightness nighdy as it reached its maximum visibility at perihelion, or closest passage to the sun, calculated to take place on March 21st. 
At this point Comet Ikeya would be 59 million miles distant from the sun and some 93 million miles from the earth. 
Then the celestial spectacle it offered would be over until late spring, when it would become visible again in the morning sky, a considerably fainter object on the far side of the sun. 
Finally, traveling in an elliptical orbit out beyond the farthest planets, it would disappear, to return anywhere from 100 to 10,000 years hence.


Comet Ikeya 1963a was at first described as dim, but a few weeks after Kaoru sighted it, reports from Tokyo, the Yerkes Observatory, in Wisconsin, and the U.S. 
Naval Observatory&#39;s station at Flagstaff, Arizona, indicated that it was moving rapidly southward and brightening.


By February and early March, 1963, Comet Ikeya was providing an exciting spectacle for southern hemisphere watchers. 
In four weeks, beginning February 13th, it had traveled northward a quarter of the way around the sky and become an object visible to the naked eye.


An American physicist then working in Sydney, Australia, wrote to the journal Sky and Telescope of his experience with the comet:


&ldquo;On February 14th I had my children in the back yard to show them 47 Tucani, a very beautiful globular cluster. 
My daughter Judy was looking through binoculars and remarked that what she saw was between the Magellanic Clouds. 
When I looked, I realized that she had not been viewing 47 at all, but a new comet&mdash;actually Ikeya&#39;s.&rdquo;


Kaoru kept in touch with his comet through a widening circle of fellow observers, but his most immediate source was the Tokyo Observatory and its staff members, notably Dr. Masahisa Tarao, distinguished astronomer and vice-president of the Japanese Astronomical Society, on whose behalf he presented Kaoru with the gold medal for achievement.


&ldquo;We professional astronomers cannot watch the heavens all the time,&rdquo; Dr. Tarao said. 
&ldquo;We need the assistance of amateurs in the observation of artificial satellites, solar explosions, meteors, comets and other phenomena of our universe. 
You, Kaoru Ikeya, by your patience and diligence, have added to our knowledge of the solar system.&rdquo;


<br />
<span class="textsc">All</span> this while, Kaoru reported for his job at the piano factory, quietly and reliably. 
Only when the press requested interviews with Kaoru did the company learn of his achievement. 
The company&#39;s response was to initiate a collection among the workers to help Ikeya continue his work. 
A certificate lauding Kaoru&#39;s off-the-job zeal and dedication together with a check for about $300, a lordly sum in Japan, were presented to him at a ceremony at the plant. 
The company also financed the movie short about Kaoru&#39;s life, and paid him 30,000 yen, or about $80, for permission to make the film.


Kaoru made no effort to capitalize on his publicity.
To have achieved a magnificent &ldquo;first&rdquo; in comet-hunt-ing was all the reward he needed, and his appreciation of it deepened when he learned of other amateur astronomers such as Dr. Floyd L. Waters, of Hugo, Oklahoma, who very nearly made it, but did not quite.  


&ldquo;On the morning of January 26th,&rdquo; Dr. Waters wrote Kaoru, &ldquo;at about 5 a.m., temperature 10 above zero, I discovered this object in the south. 
1 became quite excited, wired my finding to Harvard Observatory, and found out later that day that what I had reported was the Comet Ikeya that had been discovered by a boy in Japan on January 2nd. 
All amateur astronomers would be very thrilled to discover a comet but of course do not have the perseverance to spend 335 hours trying to find one!&rdquo;


But Comet Ikeya was not the last of Kaoru&#39;s discoveries. 
As if especially favored by the gods, Kaoru made a second discovery in June, 1964. 
Working with a new, improved telescope with a 17.5 cm mirror, which he had made at a cost of 5,000 yen, or about $13, he
discovered a second comet&mdash;Comet 1964f.


Still in the same job at the factory, Kaoru has neither sought after nor been offered the reward of advancement. 
For him the greatest advancement, according to his Buddhist faith, would be to find that &ldquo;limitless, ever-expanding path, an eternal path to tranquility.&rdquo;
For the rest, his richest reward has been that in the span of his 21 years he has made partial payment on his ko, or primary duty to his mother and to his family, by taking a dishonored name and writing it across the skies.
