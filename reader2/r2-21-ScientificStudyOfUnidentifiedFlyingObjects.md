## Introduction

If, as many people suspect, our planet is being visited clandestinely by spacecraft, manned or controlled by intelligent creatures from another world, it is the most momentous development in human history. 


Opinion surveys indicate that several million Americans believe they have seen objects that could be described as unidentified flying objects (UFOs), or &ldquo;flying saucers.&rdquo;
What, in fact, have they seen? 


It appears that the Central Intelligence Agency, in 1953, was party to a scheme to &ldquo;debunk&rdquo; the UFOs. 
(The previously-secret document relating to this proposal is Appendix U in this book.) 
Has the government, in fact, been aware for some years that earth was under surveillance and has there been an effort to avoid panic by concealing the fact? 


Or has the Air Force, in fulfilling its responsioility to deny our skies to hostile vehicles, been too lax to recognize the threat? 
Project Blue Book, the Air Force office responsible for assembling UFO reports at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, is a low-priority operation, long manned by one officer, a sergeant and secretary. 


In 1966 rumblings of discontent, both on Capitol Hill and among the public at large, led the Air Force to seek an independent assessment of the situation. 
It was a remarkable fact that, despite the enormous public interest in UFOs, the big guns of science had never been brought to bear on the problem.


Now for the first time a full-fledged scientific study has been carried out. 
Over a two-year period hundreds of cases were investigated. 
Case studies on 59 of the most important or most representative are presented in this report. 
Of these, ten relate to incidents that occurred before the project but were sufficiently well documented to merit pursuit. 


A number of alleged UFO photographs have been analyzed in depth, with measurements being made at the scenes where the photographs were taken and of the film itself. 
Some have been explained, but at least one, showing a disk-shaped object in flight over Oregon, (plates 23 through 26), is classed as difficult to explain in a conventional way. 


The study, at a cost of about half a million dollars, was carried out by the University of Colorado under the direction of Dr. Edward U. Condon. 
He was clearly chosen, not only because of his scientific eminence, but because of his unquestionable independence. 
He has served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Physical Society and as head of the National Bureau of Standards. 
The latter operated a complex of laboratories in Boulder, home of the University of Colorado. 
They now come under the recently-created Environmental Science Services Administration. 
Also in Boulder, on a mesa overlooking the town, is the National Center for Atmospheric Research. 
These centers offered Dr. Condon a wide range of experts in many fields of science. 


Dr. Condon has the build of a football halfback. 
In his mid-sixties, he is a bit old for the game. 
Nevertheless, as the reader will see in this report, he has a tendency in scientific matters to lower his knowledgeable head and charge the line. 


His independence has been many times demonstrated in his support of liberal (and sometimes unpopular) causes. 
He was one of the few who tangled with the House Committee on Un-American Activities and, to all intents and purposes, came out on top. 
Richard M. Nixon was associated with attempts to challenge his security clearance, and early in 1969 the Air Force, mindful that little love was lost between the two men, clearly wanted to get the Condon Report out of the way before Nixon became President. 


The report concludes that there is no evidence to justify a belief that extraterrestrial visitors have penetrated our skies and not enough evidence to warrant any further scientific investigation. 
As Condon himself anticipated, this will not gladden UFO enthusiasts. 
There is no question but that a great many people want to believe the extraterrestrial hypothesis. 


Why they do so is beyond the scope of the report&mdash;or this introduction. 
The feeling has been attributed to a hope that some sort of superior beings are watching over our world, prepared to intervene if things get too bad. 
Some people, too, are suspicious of &ldquo;The Establishment&rdquo; or resentful of what seems to them arrogant disregard by scientists of &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; for the existence of UFOs. 


Although people have been reporting &ldquo;flying saucers&rdquo; for more than 20 years, there has been no machinery for bringing to bear on such sightings the many techniques for objective analysis available to modern science. 
When a citizen saw a UFO he tended to call the police who, in many cases, had no idea what to do about it. 
Those who knew that the nearest Air Force base was responsible for investigating such reported intrusions into American air space often found that the man at the base assigned to such duty was preoccupied with other tasks. 


Some private organizations of concerned citizens, notably the National Investigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) and the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) did the best they could. 
However, their resources were limited and they were handicapped, particularly in their dealings with government agencies, by their unofficial status and the fact that their membership consisted largely of people sympathetic to the view that UFOs may be controlled by an alien civilization (the so-called ETI, or Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, hypothesis). 


For the University of Colorado study, experts in radar, in plasma physics, in mirages, in photographic analysis and problems of perception were called in. 
Upon receipt of a promising UFO report scientists armed with a variety of observational tools flew to the scene, in some cases to witness the phenomena themselves. 


The result has been a series of case histories that reads like a modern, real-life collection of Sherlock Holmes episodes. 
The cases range from the eerily perplexing to the preposterously naive. 
The reader is given a taste of the scientific method, even though the cases are often such that they defy anything approaching deductive analysis. 


The reader can also exercise his own judgment by comparing this report with efforts to dispute it. 
For example a book has been published by a former member of the University of Colorado project who was dismissed. 
He and his co-author argue that the project may have been organized&mdash;without the knowledge of most of its staff&mdash;as a cover to divert attention from the real nature of UFOs. 


He supports this conspiracy hypothesis with what he considers evidence that two members of a panel of top scientists convened by the government in 1953 to assess the UFO situation refused to sign the resulting report. 
That report found there was no threat to the nation in the UFOs and urged that they be stripped of their &ldquo;aura of mystery.&rdquo; 
The panel feared that an enemy could exploit the tendency of the public toward hysterical behavior through &ldquo;clogging of channels of communication by irrelevant reports.&rdquo; 
Real indications of hostile action would then be ignored. 


The chairman of the panel was Dr. H. P. Robertson of the California Institute of Technology. 
According to surviving members of the panel no one dissented from its findings, although the name of one member was deleted before the report was declassified in 1966. 
The time was one of sensitivity about involvement of the Central Intelligence Agency in activities beyond its intelligence-gathering role and all references to the CIA&#39;s role in the panel&#39;s work, as well as names of its employees and others involved in intelligence work, were deleted. 


Apart from these deletions, this document (Appendix U), like all other aspects of this report, is uncensored. 
Some of the documents presented here, as well as many of the UFO episodes, are offered to the public for the first time. 


Despite the efforts of some UFO enthusiasts to discredit the report in advance, a panel of the nation&#39;s most eminent scientists, chosen by the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, has examined it, chapter by chapter, and given it &ldquo;straight As,&rdquo; so to speak. 


This &ldquo;grading&rdquo; of the report was performed at the request of the Air Force, which foresaw charges of &ldquo;whitewash&rdquo; if&mdash;as it earnestly expected&mdash;the Colorado study echoed earlier findings that even the most mysterious UFOs have not been shown to be of exotic origin. 


Concurrence by the Academy, representing the nation&#39;s most distinguished scientists, would help divert such criticism. 
It was understood originally that the Academy panel would be asked merely to assess the working methods of the Colorado team, rather than to endorse its conclusions, but the panel went further than that. 
It expressed clear-cut agreement with the findings. 


&ldquo;We are unanimous in the opinion,&rdquo; the panel said, &ldquo;that this has been a very creditable effort to apply objectively the relevant techniques of science to the solution of the UFO problem. 
The report recognizes that there remain UFO sightings that are not easily explained. 
The report does suggest, however, so many reasonable and possible directions in which an explanation may eventually be found, that there seems to be no reason to attribute them to an extraterrestrial source without evidence that is much more convincing. 
The report also shows how difficult it is to apply scientific methods to the occasional transient sightings with any chance of success. 
While further study of particular aspects of the topic (e.g., atmospheric phenomena) may be useful, a study of UFOs in general is not a promising way to expand scientific understanding of the phenomena. 
On the basis of present knowledge the least likely explanation of UFOs is the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitations by intelligent beings.&rdquo; 


The Chairman of this panel was Dr. Gerald M. Clemence of Yale University, former Scientific Director of the United States Naval Observatory. 
The others included leading specialists in fields relevant to the UFO problem&mdash;astronomy, atmospheric physics, meteorology and psychology. They were: 


Dr. Horace R. Crane, Professor of Physics, University of Michigan. 

Dr. David M. Dennison, Professor of Physics, University of Michigan. 

Dr. Wallace O. Fenn, physiologist and former Director of the Space Science Center at the University of Rochester. 

Dr. H. Keffer Hartline, biophysicist, Professor at Rockefeller University and 1967 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology. 

Dr. Ernest R. Hilgard, Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. 

Dr. Mark Kac, mathematician, Professor at Rockefeller University. 

Dr. Francis W. Reichelderfer, former head of the United States Weather Bureau. 

Dr. William W. Rubey, Professor of Geology and Geophysics at the University of California at Los Angeles. 

Dr. Charles D. Shane, Emeritus Astronomer at the Lick Observatory in California. 

Dr. Oswald G. Villard, Jr., Director of the Radio Science Laboratory, Stanford University. 


The panel did a certain amount of homework, in addition to reviewing the Colorado report. 
It read scientific papers prepared by outspoken scientific protagonists on both sides of the controversy. 
Two of these, Dr. William Markowitz, former head of the time service at the Naval Observatory, and Dr. 
Donald H. Menzel, former director of the Harvard College Observatory, have scoffed at the extraterrestrial hypothesis. 
Another author, Dr. James E. McDonald of the University of Arizona, has argued that UFOs are one of the biggest scientific puzzles of our time and that visitations from afar are the best explanation for UFOs that cannot otherwise be explained. 


In forwarding the panel&#39;s assessment to the Air Force Dr. Frederick Seitz, President of the Academy, said: &ldquo;Substantial questions have been raised as to the adequacy of our research and investigation programs to explain or to determine the nature of these sometimes puzzling reports of observed phenomena. 
It is my hope that the Colorado report, together with our panel review, will be helpful to you and other responsible officials in determining the nature and scope of any continuing research effort in this area.&rdquo; 


The panel report was copyrighted to prevent its appearance in unauthorized publications. 
The review was done, Dr. Seitz said, &ldquo;for the sole purpose of assisting the government in reaching a decision on its future course of action. 
Its use in whole or in part for any other purpose would be incompatible with the purpose of the review and the conditions under which it was conducted.&rdquo; 


Apparently the Academy and its panel members did not want their review to appear between the covers of some of the more far-out UFO books. 
However, the review was distributed to the press on January 8, 1969, with the Colorado report itself, for release the next day. 


The report is a memorable document. 
While the case histories read like detective stories, it is also a scientific study. 
There are sections here and there that most readers will find technical and difficult to follow. 
They are easily skipped.  
However, in the technical sections there are also nuggets that no one will want to miss. 
For example in Chapter 7, on atmospheric electricity and plasma interpretations of UFOs, there are accounts of collisions of Soviet and American aircraft with a peculiar phenomenon known as ball lightning, as well as a description of the extraordinary behavior of lightning inside a tornado. 
Also of special interest is the section describing UFOs observed by astronauts (all presumably manmade objects in earth orbit). 


Efforts have been made by UFO enthusiasts to blunt the effect of this report by arguing that Dr. Condon and his colleagues were too biased for a meaningful finding. 
These attempts to discredit the report have concentrated in large measure on an episode that occurred when much of the on-the-spot investigation had been done. 


Early in the project things seemed to be going smoothly. 
The two largest quasi-scientific organizations of UFO &ldquo;buffs&rdquo; cooperated by tipping off the Colorado project to new sightings. 
They also made available samples from their files of interviews, photographs and the like. 


Then, however, a certain amount of infighting developed. 
One of the UFO groups, NICAP, is headed by Donald Keyhoe who, as author of Flying Saucers Are Real, has a vested interest in the confirmation of his thesis. 
Various statements attributed to Dr. Condon suggested to NICAP that he did not take very seriously the possibility that UFOs come from another civilization. 


In this respect it should be pointed out that Dr. Condon is a somewhat garrulous soul who loves to spin a good yarn. 
The inquiry into UFOs was a rich source of such material and he found it hard, on various occasions, not to recount some of the sillier episodes. 


This infuriated those, like Dr. McDonald at the University of Arizona, who believed in the possibility of an extraterrestrial origin. 
They charged that the Colorado project was wasting its time on crackpot reports and turning its back on the more solid evidence. 
Anyone who reads the following pages will see that this is untrue. 
It is obvious that the project concentrated on the best documented and most substantial cases and it did not hesitate to conclude that, on the basis of available evidence, some are difficult to explain by conventional means. 


The most severe blow to the project came when one of its staff members, going through the files, came across a memorandum written by Robert J. Low before the University undertook the project.
Low, who was serving as project coordinator, had been an assistant dean in the graduate school. 
His memo, to University officials, sought to analyze the pros and cons of the Air Force proposal. 
Could the University undertake the project in a manner that would satisfy public concern, yet not subject the University to ridicule by the academic community? 
He argued that the study would perforce be done almost entirely by nonbelievers and, while the project could never &ldquo;prove&rdquo; that no UFOs have ever come from another world, it could contribute impressive evidence for such a conclusion. 
&ldquo;The trick,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to the public, it would appear a totally objective study but, to the scientific community, would present the image of a group of nonbelievers trying their best to be objective, but having an almost zero expectation of finding a saucer.&rdquo; 


He proposed, to this end, that the emphasis be on the psychological and sociological investigation of those reporting UFOs, rather than on checking out the physical evidence for alleged visitations. 


Condon apparently never saw this memo at the time it was written and, in fact, rejected suggestions that the emphasis be on the psychology of UFO witnesses. As the case histories in this report show, the stress was on the search for physical evidence and physical explanations. 
However, the Low memo fell into the hands of Dr. McDonald and of NICAP. 
it was brought to the attention of John G. Fuller, author of two books (Incident at Exeter and Interrupted Journey) supporting the extraterrestrial explanation for UFOs. 
In an article in Look magazine, which had published parts of his two books, Fuller quoted the memo and reported dissension among staff members of the Colorado project. 
His article was entitled &ldquo;Flying Saucer Fiasco,&rdquo; with the subtitle: &ldquo;The Extraordinary Story of the Half-Million-Dollar &#39;Trick&#39; to Make Americans Believe the Condon Committee Was Conducting an Objective Investigation.&rdquo; 


Two men whom Condon considered responsible for leaking the memo to disgruntled UFO believers were discharged from the project. 


In exploring possible roots of this controversy the journal Science quoted a statement by James and Coral Lorenzen, who run the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) in Tucson, Arizona, which rivals NICAP as a comparatively sober association of UFO buffs. 
They sug- gested that there was &ldquo;a strong attempt by the NICAP group (McDonald and Saunders are both close to NICAP) to control the study. 
When they found they couldn&#39;t control it, they attempted to scuttle it.&rdquo; 


Whatever the merits of this analysis, the Condon Report and the challenges to it must stand or fall on their own merits&mdash;not on the degree of squabbling that may, or may not have occurred in its preparation. 
That Condon, an old scientific pro, was well aware of this shines forth from the pages of this document. 


There is probably no such thing as a scientific researcher without bias. 
It is rare indeed for someone to undertake an experiment with no inkling as to its outcome. 
More commonly the scientist has formulated a hypothesis and he carries out a series of experiments that, he hopes, will convince himself&mdash;and all the world&mdash;of its correctness. 
Those experiments, to assure him of a place in scientific history, must, insofar as possible, be such that any other scientist can confirm his results. 


The extent to which such tests can be applied to UFOs is limited. 
More often, as the case histories show, the judgement must be based on common sense. 
If, for example, it can be shown that a UFO photograph could have been faked, and if the story told by the person who took the picture displays suspicious inconsistencies, then Condon and his colleagues have tended to reject the picture as evidence. 
Those inclined to be believers might be more willing to accept the picture as genuine, but they could not use it as &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. 


A reading of the case histories in this report forces on the reader a certain humility regarding human perception. 
We do not see only with our eyes and hear only with our ears. 
We see and hear with that complex and little-understood organ, the brain, crammed with memories and earlier impressions. 


It is the ingenuity of this brain that enables us to read fast or recognize a friend at a glance. 
If we had to read every letter of every word, or had to scrutinize the entire physiognomy of a person to recognize him, the pace of our lives would be slow indeed. 
Instead we have learned to deduce entire words or phrases and entire people from a limited number of observed clues. 


However, when the circumstances are unusual we can easily be fooled by misleading clues. 
Nicolaas Tinbergen, Professor of Animal Behavior at Oxford and a founder of the young science of ethology (the study of animal behavior in the wild), told me of a personal experience that illustrates this. 


In east Greenland he was once atop a mountain a number of miles inland. 
Offshore wind had blown the pack ice beyond the horizon some days earlier and now, to his horror, he saw the distant sea in violent motion. 
Giant waves were racing toward shore. &ldquo;We must get down off the mountain,&rdquo; he told his Eskimo companion excitedly. &ldquo;That gale could hit any minute and blow us off the mountain!&rdquo; 


Then suddenly the motion of the sea stopped as though a moving picture had been brought to a halt. 
This occurred at the moment when his mind realized that he was looking at pack ice that had blown back onshore, not at waves. 
The motion was a fiction of his brain. 


It was not many generations ago that ghosts seemed plausible, and night visions, be they wisps of luminous gas rising from a swamp, or play of moonlight on a blowing curtain, could raise palpitations in the most stalwart heart. 
Today, if one hears a creak in the night or sees a peculiar glow, the usual reaction is to investigate, rather than duck under the covers. 
However, UFOs are often too far away for such intimate checking. 


This report, in showing the fallibility of even such sober observers as policemen, airline pilots and radar operators, raises questions as to the role of conditioning in many other fields of human activity. 
The purveyors of advertising are well versed in the techniques of conditioning, but one wonders to what extent this phenomenon affects such basic attitudes as our nationalism, our theological point of view and our moral standards. 


Are they really founded on logic and the ultimate truth? 


One cannot help but view our points of view on a great many things with new skepticism. 


Anyone who reads this study will, I believe, lay it down with a new perspective on human values and limitations.

Section I 
## Conclusions and Recommendations
Edward U. Condon 



We believe that the existing record and the results, of the Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects of the University of Colorado, which are presented in detail in subsequent sections of this report, support the conclusions and recommendations which follow. 


As indicated by its title, the emphasis of this study has been on attempting to learn from UFO reports anything that could be considered as adding to scientific knowledge. 
Our general conclusion is that nothing has come from the study of UFOs in the past 21 years that has added to scientific knowledge. 
Careful consideration of the record as it is available to us leads us to conclude that further extensive study of UFOs probably cannot be justified in the expectation that science will be advanced thereby. 


It has been argued that this lack of contribution to science is due to the fact that very little scientific effort has been put on the subject. 
We do not agree. We feel that the reason that there has been very little scientific study of the subject is that those scientists who are most directiy concerned, astronomers, atmospheric physicists, chemists, and psychologists, having had ample opportunity to look into the matter, have individually decided that UFO phenomena do not offer a fruitful field in which to look for major scientific discoveries. 


This conclusion is so important, and the public seems in general to have so little understanding of how scientists work, that some more comment on it seems desirable. 
Each person who sets out to make a career of scientific research, chooses a general field of broad specialization in which to acquire proficiency. 
Within that field he looks for specific fields in which to work. To do this he keeps abreast of the published scientific literature, attends scientific meetings, where reports on current progress are given, and energetically discusses his interests and those of his colleagues both face-to-face and by correspondence with them. 
He is motivated by an active curiosity about nature and by a personal desire to make a contribution to science.
He is constantly probing for error and incompleteness in the efforts that have been made in his fields of interest, and looking for new ideas about new ways to attack new problems. 
From this effort he arrives at personal decisions as to where his own effort can be most fruitful. 
These decisions are personal in the sense that he must estimate his own intellectual limitations, and the limitations inherent in the working situation in which he finds himself, including limits on the support of his work, or his involvement with other pre-existing scientific commitments. 
While individual errors of judgment may arise, it is generally not true that all of the scientists who are actively cultivating a given field of science are wrong for very long. 


Even conceding that the entire body of &ldquo;official&rdquo; science might be in error for a time, we believe that there is no better way to correct error than to give free reign to the ideas of individual scientists to make decisions as to the directions in which scientific progress is most likely to be made. 
For legal work sensible people seek an attorney, and for medical treatment sensible people seek a qualified physician. 
The nation&#39;s surest guarantee of scientific excellence is to leave the decision making process to the individual and collective judgment of its scientists. 


Scientists are no respecters of authority. 
Our conclusion that study of UFO reports is not likely to advance science will not be uncritically accepted by them. 
Nor should it be, nor do we wish it to be. For scientists, it is our hope that the detailed analytical presentation of what we were able to do, and of what we were unable to do, will assist them in deciding whether or not they agree with our conclusions. 
Our hope is that the details of this report will help other scientists in seeing what the problems are and the difficulties of coping with them. 


If they agree with our conclusions, they will turn their valuable attention and talents elsewhere. 
If they disagree it will be because our report has helped them reach a clear picture of wherein existing studies are faulty or incomplete and thereby will have stimulated ideas for more accurate studies. 
If they do get such ideas and can formulate them clearly, we have no doubt that support will be forthcoming to carry on with such clearly-defined, specific studies. 
We think that such ideas for work should be supported. 


Some readers may think that we have now wandered into a contradiction. 
Earlier we said that we do not think study of UFO reports is likely to be a fruitful direction of scientific advance; now we have just said that persons with good ideas for specific studies in this field should be supported. 
This is no contradiction. Although we conclude after nearly two years of intensive study, that we do not see any fruitful lines of advance from the study of UFO reports, we believe that any scientist with adequate training and credentials who does come up with a clearly defined, specific proposal for study should be supported. 


What we are saying here was said in a more general context nearly a century ago by William Kingdon Clifford, a great English mathematical physicist. 
In his &ldquo;Aims and Instruments of Scientific Thought&rdquo; he expressed himself this way: 

<blockquote>
    Remember, then, that [scientific thought] is the guide of action; that the truth which it arrives at is not that which we can ideally contemplate without error, but that which we may act upon without fear; and you cannot fail to see that scientific thought is not an accompaniment or condition of human progress, but human progress itself.
</blockquote>

Just as individual scientists may make errors of judgment about fruitful directions for scientific effort, so also any individual administrator or committee which is charged with deciding on financial support for research proposals may also make an error of judgment. 
This possibility is minimized by the existence of parallel channels, for consideration by more than one group, of proposals for research projects. 
In the period since 1945, the federal government has evolved flexible and effective machinery for giving careful consideration to proposals from properly qualified scientists. 
What to some may seem like duplicated machinery actually acts as a safeguard against errors being made by some single official body. 
Even so, some errors could be made but the hazard is reduced nearly to zero. 


Therefore we think that all of the agencies of the federal government, and the private foundations as well, ought to be willing to consider UFO research proposals along with the others submitted to them on an open-minded, unprejudiced basis. While we do not think at present that anything worth-while is likely to come of such research each individual case ought to be carefully considered on its own merits. 


This formulation carries with it the corollary that we do not think that at this time the federal government ought to set up a major new agency, as some have suggested, for the scientific study of UFOs. 
This conclusion may not be true for all time. If, by the progress of research based on new ideas in this field, it then appears worthwhile to create such an agency, the decision to do so may be taken at that time. 


We find that there are important areas of atmospheric optics, including radio wave propagation, and of atmospheric electricity in which present knowledge is quite incomplete. 
These topics came to our attention in connection with the interpretation of some UFO reports, but they are also of fundamental scientific interest, and they are relevant to practical problems related to the improvement of safety of military and civilian flying. 


Research efforts are being carried out in these areas by the Department of Defense, the Environmental Science Services Administration, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and by universities and nonprofit research organizations such as the National Center for Atmospheric Research, whose work is sponsored by the National Science Foundation. 
We commend these efforts. By no means should our lack of enthusiasm for study of UFO reports as such be misconstrued as a recommendation that these important related fields of scientific work not be adequately supported in the future. 
In an era of major development of air travel, of space exploration, and of military aerospace activities, everything possible should be done to improve our basic understanding of all atmospheric phenomena, and to improve the training of astronauts and aircraft pilots in the recognition and understanding of such phenomena. 


As the reader of this report will readily judge, we have focussed attention almost entirely on the physical sciences. 
This was in part a matter of determining priorities and in part because we found rather less than some persons may have expected in the way of psychiatric problems related to belief in the reality of UFOs as craft from remote galactic or intergalactic civilizations. 
We believe that the rigorous study of the beliefs&mdash;unsupported by valid evidence&mdash;held by individuals and even by some groups might prove of scientific value to the social and behavioral sciences. 
There is no implication here that individual or group psychopathology is a principal area of study. 
Reports of UFOs offer interesting challenges to the student of cognitive processes as they are affected by individual and social variables. 
By this connection, we conclude that a content-analysis of press and television coverage of UFO reports might yield data of value both to the social scientist and the communications specialist. 
The lack of such a study in the present report is due to a judgment on our part that other areas of investigation were of much higher priority. 
We do not suggest, however, that the UFO phenomenon is, by its nature, more amenable to study in these disciplines than in the physical sciences. 
On the contrary, we conclude that the same specificity in proposed research in these areas is as desirable as it is in the physical sciences. 


The question remains as to what, if anything, the federal government should do about the UFO reports it receives from the general public. 
We are inclined to think that nothing should be done with them in the expectation that they are going to contribute to the advance of science. 


This question is inseparable from the question of the national defense interest of these reports. 
The history of the past 21 years has repeatedly led Air Force officers to the conclusion that none of the things seen, or thought to have been seen, which pass by the name of UFO reports, constituted any hazard or threat to national security. 


We felt that it was out of our province to attempt an independent evaluation of this conclusion. 
We adopted the attitude that, without attempting to assume the defense responsibility which is that of the Air Force, if we came across any evidence whatever that seemed to us to indicate a defense hazard we would call it to the attention of the Air Force at once. 
We did not find any such evidence. We know of no reason to question the finding of the Air Force that the whole class of UFO reports so far considered does not pose a defense problem. 


At the same time, however, the basis for reaching an opinion of this kind is that such reports have been given attention, one by one, as they are received. 
Had no attention whatever been given to any of them, we would not be in a position to feel confident of this conclusion. 
Therefore it seems that only so much attention to the subject should be given as the Department of Defense deems to be necessary strictly from a defense point of view. 
The level of effort should not be raised because of arguments that the subject has scientific importance, so far as present indications go. 


It is our impression that the defense function could be performed within the framework established for intelligence and surveillance operations without the continuance of a special unit such as Project Blue Book, but this is a question for defense specialists rather than research scientists. 


It has been contended that the subject has been shrouded in official secrecy. 
We conclude otherwise. We have no evidence of secrecy concerning UFO reports. 
What has been miscalled secrecy has been no more than an intelligent policy of delay in releasing data so that the public does not become confused by premature publication of incomplete studies of reports. 


The subject of UFOs has been widely misrepresented to the public by a small number of individuals who have given sensationalized presentations in writings and public lectures. 
So far as we can judge, not many people have been misled by such irresponsible behavior, but whatever effect there has been has been bad. 


A related problem to which we wish to direct public attention is the miseducation in our schools which arises from the fact that many children are being allowed, if not actively encouraged, to devote their science study time to the reading of UFO books and magazine articles of the type referred to in the preceding paragraph. 
We feel that children are educationally harmed by absorbing unsound and erroneous material as if it were scientifically well founded. 
Such study is harmful not merely because of the erroneous nature of the material itself, but also because such study retards the development of a critical faculty with regard to scientific evidence, which to some degree ought to be part of the education of every American.
Therefore we strongly recommend that teachers refrain from giving students credit for school work based on their reading of the presently available UFO books and magazine articles. 
Teachers who find their students strongly motivated in this direction should attempt to channel their interests in the direction of serious study of astronomy and meteorology, and in the direction of critical analysis of arguments for fantastic propositions that are being supported by appeals to fallacious reasoning or false data.
We hope that the results of our study will prove useful to scientists and those responsible for the formation of public policy generally in dealing with this problem which has now been with us for 21 years.
