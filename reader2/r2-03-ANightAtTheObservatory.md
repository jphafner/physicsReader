    A reporter spends a night on Mt. Palomar talking about astronomy with Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein as he photographs star spectra with the 200 inch telescope. 
intro: An article from <em>Horizon</em>, 1967. 
---


A year ago last summer, I was invited out to Mount Palomar, the big observatory in southern California, to spend a night on the two-hundred-inch telescope.
A member of the observatory&#39;s staff wrote me exuberantly, &ldquo;The scientists here feel that the last couple of years have been the most exciting in astronomy since Galileo.&rdquo;
He was referring to observations of the quasars, most of which had been made at Mount Palomar.
Quasars are thought to be tremendously distant objects that may be almost as old as the universe itself; as yet, not a great deal is known about them.
&ldquo;Dr. Jesse L. Greenstein.  Executive Officer of the Department of Astronomy at Cal Tech, will be going down to Palomar soon, and he says he will be glad to have you go along,&rdquo; my correspondent continued.
&ldquo;He says to warn you not to expect any great discoveries.&rdquo;
That was an acceptable condition. As a final admonition, he added that the telescope is extremely delicate, and before I went out I had to promise to do my best not to break it.
This, I thought, would be an easy promise to keep, since the telescope is as big as a small freighter. 


On my way to Palomar, I stopped in Pasadena at the California Institute of Technology, which runs the observatory.
A smog that made one&#39;s eyes smart hung over the city.
I found that Dr. Greenstein was already at Palomar, a hundred and thirty-five miles to the south and fifty-six hundred feet up in the clearer, cooler air.
I headed south, too.
The road wound through ranches and forest up and up a mountain.
Soon I saw across a valley, perched on the edge of a plateau, the glistening aluminum dome of the observatory.
The huge slit for the telescope to peer through was shut like a closed eyelid.

On top of the plateau, which was dotted with nine sturdy yellow cottages, I headed toward the Monastery, where I expected to find Dr. Greenstein.
The Monastery is the dormitory where the astronomers stay when they are using the two-hundred-inch telescope or the smaller forty-eight-inch Schmidt telescope.
The Monastery is a solid building fitted out with black leather blinds for daytime sleeping.
It was six o&#39;clock in the evening.
Dr. Greenstein, who had been up all the night before, was in the dining room having a solitary supper; a stocky, graying man in his mid-fifties who sported a tiny, pencil-thin moustache, he was the only astronomer on the mountain.
Dr. Greenstein complained about not being able to sleep.
&ldquo;The first night I&#39;m down here, I can&#39;t sleep at all,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;It isn&#39;t until the fifth day that I get a full night&#39;s, or rather morning&#39;s, sleep, and then it&#39;s time to go back to Pasadena.&rdquo;
I asked him how often he had to go through this sleepless state, and he answered that in his case it was about thirty-five nights a year. 


&ldquo;I get up here whenever I can,&rdquo; he went on, planting an elbow next to a half-empty coffee cup.
&ldquo;Time on the telescope is so valuable that you snatch at it whenever you can get it.
Just having the two-hundred-inch telescope puts Cal Tech in a tough spot.
It&#39;s a national asset, so we can&#39;t do anything trivial.
Any reasonably good astronomer would have to try hard in order not to make an interesting discovery with it.
In practice it is used mainly by the members of the Department of Astronomy, and even with just sixteen of us, we are forever feuding to get time on the telescope.
Cloudy time can be a real disaster.&rdquo; 


I said I hoped Dr. Greenstein wouldn&#39;t be clouded out tonight, and he replied that he didn&#39;t think he would be.
Since he had some preparations to make for the evening&#39;s work, I accompanied him along a path from the Monastery through a dry, prickly field toward the dome.
It was partially hidden over the brow of a hill; for all anyone could tell, a big silver balloon had crash-landed there.


I asked Dr. Greenstein whether he had been involved with quasars lately.
He shrugged. &ldquo;I feel that my work, which is mostly the composition of stars within our galaxy, is more important; and current interpretations of quasars may be obsolete by next week.&rdquo;
Although Dr. Greenstein is best known for his studies of the evolution of stars and galaxies, and of the elements within the stars, he is a top quasar man, too, and he has made observations to learn what their composition might be. 


Quasars were first noticed in 1960 by radio astronomers as invisible sources of radio waves.
One of these sources, 3C-48, was identified with what appeared to be a tiny, sixteenth-magnitude star.
Three years later Dr. Maarten Schmidt, at Palomar, managed to concentrate on film enough of the feeble light from a quasar to get a spectrum.
It appeared that quasars were not tiny stars within our own galaxy, as had been thought, but instead probably were intense and incredibly distant sources of light and radio waves.
Quasar 3C-48 appears to be almost four billion light-years away, and subsequently other quasars have been measured out to almost nine billion light-years away; this is four-fifths of the way back to the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; with which the universe supposedly began. 


By studying the quasars, it may be possible to learn whether the universe will expand indefinitely; or whether it will stop some day; or whether it will fall back in upon itself for another big bang&mdash;and if so, when these events will take place.
But a great deal more information is needed about the quasars, including the answer to why they shine so much more brightly than even the brightest galaxies.
This is a problem that Dr. Greenstein is working on.


&ldquo;As it happens, I don&#39;t like working with quasars,&rdquo; Dr. Greenstein continued as we trudged along.
&ldquo;They&#39;re tricky little things. I don&#39;t even like the word &lsquo;quasar.&rsquo;
It was invented by a Chinese astronomer in New York who doesn&#39;t speak English well.
Chinese is like Hebrew, which has no vowels.
He saw the letters QSRS, which stand for quasi-stellar radio source, on a chart, and called them &lsquo;quasars.&rsquo;
We shouldn&#39;t have a vocabulary for what we don&#39;t know, and when we do know what the quasars are, we will have a better word for them.
Quasar sounds as if it&#39;s short for quasi-star, and that&#39;s the one thing we know a quasar isn&#39;t.&rdquo; 
Dr. Greenstein observed that the sky, darkening fast now, was beautifully clear.
The moon, about half full, was rising in the east, clear crystal against the dark blue background, which, Dr. Greenstein said, augured well for seeing tonight.
The setting sun glinted red on the dome. 
Dr. Greenstein glanced at the cirrus clouds in the west, which were reddening as the sun sank.
&ldquo;Sunsets are nice,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you haven&#39;t seen anything until you see a sunrise at Palomar.&rdquo; 


The dome, which is nine stories tall and as much as that in diameter, rises from a round, yellow, cement drum.
Dr. Greenstein fitted a key in a latch, and soon we were blinking our eyes inside a cavernous, pitch-black room three stories below the telescope.
Dr.  Greenstein said he had some work to do in his darkroom and suggested I go to the third floor and take a look at the telescope. 


<figure>
<figcaption>
    In operation the Hale telescope resembles nothing so much as a large bucket made to gather light The mirror collects light and bounces it fifty-five feet up to a focal point where the prime-focus cage is located For spectrographic analysis, the light is reflected back down and out to the room at lower right.
</figcaption>
</figure>


The inside of the dome was stuffy, dim, mysterious, and silent except for the echo of some approaching footsteps.
The telescope loomed in the center of the room, shadowy and intricate, its works mostly exposed, like a fine timepiece under a glass bell.
The telescope, Dr. Greenstein had told me, works something like a clock.
Its tube has to keep time exactly with the movement of the stars so that a star&#39;s light can stay riveted to a photographic plate for several hours at a stretch.
The telescope, with its reflecting mirror two hundred inches in diameter, serves as a sort of bucket to catch as much light as possible from a star and concentrate it on film: it could pick up the light of a ten-watt bulb a million miles away.
The purpose of the telescope is not to magnify, for no matter how great the magnification, no star would ever show up as more than a point of light. 


The footsteps I had heard belonged to the night assistant for the telescope, Gary Tuton, a lean young man with short, wavy hair.
Tuton is the technician who runs the telescope for the astronomers.
He walked over to a control console and pressed a button.
The telescope sprang into life. 
The big mirror, which weighs almost fifteen tons, rests at the bottom of the telescope tube, an open steel cylinde some sixty feet long. 
The tube swivels north and south inside a huge frame called the yoke, and the yoke swivels from east to west on two enormous bearings, so that the tube, with the mirror at its bottom, can aim at any point in the sky. 


Now the yoke spun to the east and the tube swiveled to the north, only, since both these motions happened simultaneously, the movement was one smooth undulation. 
The tube can be locked on a star, just as the pencil in a compass can be locked at any given radius. 
Then the star can be tracked along its path simply by turning the yoke, which is fixed on the North Star as if it were the dot at the center of a circle. 
The movement of the yoke has to be very delicate. 
Tuton explained that the huge bearings at either end of the yoke are floated on thin films of oil so that the telescope, which weighs five hundred tons, can be turned by hand. 
The oil pumps under the enormous bearings whined. 
The observatory sounded like a very active railroad yard. 


Slowly and ponderously the two-hundred-and-twenty-five-ton doors that covered the slit in the dome pulled aside, revealing a widening band of dark blue sky. 
It was like being inside the eye of an awakening animal. 
&ldquo;Some-times, in winter, when the dome is covered with snow, 1 have to go up top and sweep the snow off the slit,&rdquo; Tuton said. 
&ldquo;One night last winter it got so cold that the gears on the doors that cover the slit in the dome froze. 
No matter what I did, one shutter would shut and the other wouldn&#39;t, and there was a snowstorm coming. 
But by and large the weather is pretty good up here. Last year we used the telescope on three hundred and ten nights.&rdquo; 


A door banged and Dr. Greenstein appeared, struggling under a load of lenses and photographic film. 
Since it was still too early to begin taking pictures. 
Dr. Greenstein said that he was going up into the prime-focus cage at the top of the telescope tube and invited me to come along. 
&ldquo;I want to take a look at a group of stars, a globular cluster called Messier 13,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;There&#39;s a peculiar star in it that I want to get a spectrum of later on. 
It&#39;s in with such a mass of other stars that I want to make sure I get my bearings straight.&rdquo; 


Dr. Greenstein explained that the prime focus was the simplest and most direct way of looking through the telescope. 
There are several different ways, and none of them is the conventional one, used with binoculars or refractor telescopes, of holding the telescope up to your eyes. 
Instead of focusing light through a lens, the big mirror bounces the light back up the tube and concentrates it at a point fifty-five feet above. 
The exact spot is called the prime focus. 
The astronomer sits in the prime-focus cage, which is like a balloonist&#39;s basket high inside the telescope tube, and from this vantage point he can photograph the image directly.

&ldquo;I like it in the prime-focus cage,&rdquo; Dr. Greenstein concluded. 
&ldquo;You feel closer to the stars.&rdquo; 
Then he frisked himself and me, removing any hard objects, such as coins and pens, that might fall on the mirror and damage it. 
It had taken eleven years to polish the mirror into exactly the right configuration; a scratch could mean years more polishing. 
We climbed to a balcony, boarded the dome elevator, and began a long, hair-raising ascent as the elevator rose upward and outward, following the overhanging contour of the dome.
Through the slit we could see the ground several stories below, and several thousand feet below that, the lights of the valley floor. 
The dome elevator is a peculiar, unenclosed contraption like a long spoon; we stood at the outer end of it where the bowl would be. 
After a bumpy ride, the elevator deposits the astronomer, like a dollop of medicine, inside the mouth of the telescope. 
At this point, the astronomer is about seventy feet above the floor of the dome, with very little to hang on to. 


&ldquo;People have gotten killed on telescopes,&rdquo; Dr. Greenstein said with what I thought was poor timing as we lurched unevenly up and out. 
&ldquo;Sometimes astronomers get squashed by a telescope slewing about, but that doesn&#39;t happen very often.&rdquo; 


I gripped the railing of the elevator, fixed my eyes firmly on the top of the dome, and asked Dr. Greenstein to tell me more about the peculiar star in Messier 13. 
&ldquo;Globular clusters, like Messier 13, are sort of suburbs of our galaxy which contain some of the oldest stars, and for this reason they might have a bearing on the quasars, which are supposed to be primordial objects, too,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;However, the star I want to look at now is blue, a color usually associated with younger stars, so in this case it must represent a peculiar stage of evolution. 
Although this star&mdash;Barnard 29&mdash;is blue, it has a peculiar energy distribution. 
Its spectrum is too much in the red, and one possibility I want to check tonight is whether it couldn&#39;t in fact be a close pair, a double star, one blue and one red.&rdquo; 


<br />
<!--NOTE: TODO: letterine-->
Soon we were directly on top of the telescope tube, and Dr. Greenstein flung open a flimsy gate at the end of the elevator platform. 
The prime-focus cage&mdash;a bucket perhaps five feet in diameter and five feet deep&mdash;was about eighteen inches below us. Dr. Greenstein explained that the elevator couldn&#39;t go all the way to the cage because of the danger of collision with the telescope: we would have to travel across the remaining gap ourselves. 
So saying, he flung himself into the void and disappeared into the mouth of the telescope. 


Inside the bucket was a chair and an empty well that looked straight down at the mirror: the astronomer fits his instruments into the well.
When Tuton was sure that we were safely installed, and that nothing could drop on the mirror, he opened the diaphragm that covered it.
Slowly, like a water lily, the petals of the diaphragm lifted, revealing what looked like a pond of rippling, shimmering water beneath. 
The stars, which wouldn&#39;t stay still, were streaking like meteors; the mirror, it seemed, was popping a few millionths of an inch with the change of temperature. 
Tuton slewed the telescope off in search of Messier 13 and Barnard 29. 
As one side of the bucket dipped suddenly down, the chair, which was on rails, moved around and down with gravity, so that the astronomer was always upright; the sensation was like riding very slowly in a Ferris wheel. 
Stars shot through the big mirror as we sailed along. 
The telescope came to a smooth halt, moving just fast enough to keep the stars still in spite of the rotation of the earth. 
Dr. Greenstein peered into the pool of light for a moment.
Then he maneuvered a tiny lens that looked like a magnifying glass&mdash;it was tied to the well with a string&mdash;until he found the exact spot where the image was clearest.
This was the prime focus.

&ldquo;We&#39;re right on the beam,&rdquo; Dr. Greenstein said, handing the lens to me.
As I looked down, I felt my glasses begin to slide down my nose; I grabbed them just before they dropped down the well toward the mirror.
The lens resolved the chaotic splotches of dancing light, and I saw an enormous rash of stars, each one a point of hard, brilliant light.
I couldn&#39;t make out Barnard 29. Dr. Greenstein was able to converse with Tuton over an intercom, and he asked him to slop the telescope&#39;s tracking drive.
No sooner had the telescope stopped moving than Messier 13 and Barnard 29 slipped out of the field of vision.
Other stars whizzed across the mirror, following Messier 13 into seeming oblivion; a given star crossed the mirror in about ten seconds, before vanishing.
That, Dr. Greenstein said, showed how fast the earth, with the telescope, was turning.
Tuton&#39;s voice crackled through the microphone, asking how I felt.
I replied that I was getting a little dizzy.
Tuton started up the tracking device; the telescope passed all the stars that had been whipping by.  and soon we were safely back with Messier 13. 


&ldquo;Did Dr. Greenstein tell you about the time I was stuck up there?&rdquo; 
Tuton asked; and his voice crackled on, &ldquo;I was in the prime-focus cage when the power for the telescope shorted out. 
It was a cold winter night. 
I had to climb down, which was the hairiest thing I ever did. 
What made me do it was not the cold so much as what the men who came in the morning would say. 
I&#39;d never have lived it down.&rdquo; 


<br />
At last Tuton wafted the telescope toward the elevator platform for us to board. 
I fixed my eye on the top of the dome again. 
Dr. Greenstein glanced at his watch and said that he wished the elevator would hurry, because it was already dark enough to start using the spectrograph. 
He shouted down to Tuton to start setting up the telescope for the coude focus. 
The coude focus is in a room outside the telescope altogether, and the light from a star is deflected to it by a mirror&mdash;called the coude flat&mdash;which bounces the starlight in a thin beam down through a hole in the southern foundation of the telescope and into the coude room one floor below, where the spectrographs are kept. 
The film to record the spectrum of a star is in this room, which serves something of the purpose of an old Brownie box camera. As we reached the ground, an electronic engine whirred and the coude flat, weighing a ton and a half, lifted slowly into position just below the prime-focus cage. 
It glittered like a jewel inside a watch Dr. Greenstein fetched the films he had brought with him and disappeared down the steps into the coude room, a tiny chamber that descends steeply in line with the yoke, pointing at the North Star. 
It was already after eight o&#39;clock. 
Barnard 29 was nestled among so many stars that the final zeroing in had to be done by dead reckoning.  
&ldquo;There&#39;s a sort of triangle of stars,&rdquo; said Dr. Greenstein, who had returned to the control room at the top of the steps. 
&ldquo;See it? There ought to be a double star on the upper left. 
Got it?&rdquo; 
He sounded like a man finding his way with a road map. 
Tuton said he had it.  
&ldquo;Do you know what the most difficult object to find is?&rdquo; 
Tuton asked as he turned a knob for fine adjustment; I said I didn&#39;t. 
&ldquo;It&#39;s the moon.
The moon is so close, and it&#39;s moving so fast, that it&#39;s like trying to aim a rifle at a moving target close by, instead of at the trees standing behind it.&rdquo; 


All of a sudden, Barnard 29 disappeared from view. 
It was as if the telescope had gone dead. 
Tuton raced out into the dome and peered up at the sky through the slit; a long, wispy cloud was obstructing the view. 
&ldquo;Looks like it&#39;s going to-be a cloud-dodging night,&rdquo; he said. 
Quickly Tuton and Greenstein flipped the telescope to another star, called HD 165195, which was in a cloudless part of the sky. 


<br />
I asked Dr. Greenstein whether we would see any quasars that night. 
&ldquo;The moon is up, so we can&#39;t work on anything as dim as quasars,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;That&#39;s probably just as well. 
There isn&#39;t much you can tell by looking at a quasar anyway. 
Instead, I will be doing long exposures on some of the oldest stars in the galaxy. 
The procedure is much the same as with quasars; and in fact part of what we&#39;ll be doing is related to quasars. 
There is a theory that has to be explored that the quasars are a remnant of the first formation of galaxies. 
According to this theory, during the contraction of the gases that formed the galaxies, some super-massive objects formed within them. 
These objects may have become extremely dense and pulled themselves together so rapidly that they exploded. 
Perhaps that is what the quasars are. 
I don&#39;t know. 
I&#39;m fairly neutral on the subject.  
There is evidence in our own galaxy of a superexplosion far greater than the explosion of a supernova, but less. 
I think, than a quasar explosion. 
In any event, if the quasars represent monumental explosions within. 
galaxies during the half-billion years or so that the galaxies and the stars were condensing out of primeval gas clouds, then you would expect that the oldest stars, the first to condense from the gases, would be heavily contaminated by the elements in the quasars. 
They would have been loaded with the products of quasar evolution.&rdquo;


Dr. Greenstein turned out the lights in the control room and pressed a button to start the exposure. 
The control room was lit only by the soft-green glow of the dials on the control panel, like the cockpit of an airplane at night. 
&ldquo;So 1 will be looking at some of the oldest stars in our galaxy, like this one, to see whether they have the same elements and in roughly the same proportions, as the quasars. 
We don&#39;t know yet the exact composition of the quasars, but we may be able to do something with oxygen or iron. 
If they have the same elements, it might indicate quasars were the raw material in forming stars. 
But if there are other elements aside from those found in quasars, it might prove that the quasars are not important in star evolution, for the oldest stars don&#39;t seem to have manufactured many new elements after their formation, such as metals.
But if I find a trace of metal in HD 165195, I have to decide whether it might have been cooked within the star after all. 
or whether the metal was part of the original gases of which the star was composed. 
The chances are we won&#39;t know much more after tonight. 
I&#39;ll need this type of information on hundreds of stars before I can begin to get anywhere.&rdquo; 


The lime was eight-thirty. 
I found myself standing in the path of the slender stream of light from HD 165195. and Dr. Greenstein asked me to step out of the way, which wasn&#39;t easy, since the control room was cramped and narrow A licking sound filled the room. 
Dr. Greenstein said that the ticking came from the photoelectric scaler, which counts the number of photons coming from a star, like a light meter, hach tick meant twenty thousand photons of light. 
A dial kept count of the ticks, and Dr. Greenstein said that, for this exposure, he wanted about thirty-three hundred. 


<br />
He invited me to look through the eyepiece of the spectrograph. 
A spectrograph, an apparatus in the control room that intercepted the light coming from HD 165195. 
refracts and spreads out the light from a star into its component wave lights, giving a spectrum something like the light from a prism. 
The lines in a spectrum show the elements in a star. 
They also show how fast an object is receding from the earth by how much the lines are shifted to the red end of the spectrum. 
This is called the red shift, and it was in this way that Schmidt first decided the quasars were tremendously distant objects. 
Through the eyepiece, the star appeared as a fuzzy, bright-green spark; the star&#39;s light had been shattered by passing through a slit and some gratings inside the spectrograph.
Dr. Greenstein said the light had left the star ten thousand years ago. 
Tuton darted across to the telescope&#39;s control panel and slowed down the telescope&#39;s tracking drive by a tiny fraction. 
&ldquo;We want to make the star trail along the slit in the spectrograph,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;This is what we have to do with faint objects. 
It&#39;s like painting one brush stroke over another, until you get the proper intensity on the plate.&rdquo; 


With everything squared away, Tuton settled down by the eyepiece, stretched, yawned, and tuned in a radio to a rock-&#39;n&#39;-roll station in San Bernardino. 
He kept an ear cocked to make sure the ticking didn&#39;t stop, and every once in a while he checked the eyepiece to make sure the star was still there. 
I asked Dr. Greenslein why he and the other astronomers couldn&#39;t stay in Pasadena, and phone down to Tuton whenever they wanted a plate taken of a star. 
&ldquo;There are loo many things that can go wrong,&rdquo; Dr. Greenstein said. &ldquo;I wouldn&#39;t know whether a plate was any good or not unless I was here.&rdquo; 
Tuton concurred with him. 
&ldquo;I&#39;ve never been trained in astronomy,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;I can run the telescope all right, and find a star, but when it comes to astronomy, I just haven&#39;t the foggiest idea what&#39;s going on. 
The astronomer never says what he&#39;s doing.
Half the time he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s done until he&#39;s gotten back to Pasadena. 
I didn&#39;t know anything about quasars until I read about them in the papers.&rdquo; 
Then Tuton pulled out a magazine, which he squinted at by the light of the dials. 


Dr. Greenstein suggested that we go out on the catwalk. 
Except for a gentle breeze, the plateau was absolutely still. 
I could see the smaller dome of the Schmidt telescope about half a mile to the east. 
Dr. Greenstein pointed out a spot between the two domes where an Air Force bomber had crashed four years earlier, killing the crew and two horses that belonged to the superintendent of the observatory but miraculously doing no damage to the telescope. 
Away to the northwest, the smog over Los Angeles glowed&mdash;possibly in something of the way the outer gases of the quasars shine, powered by some mysterious force inside. 
There was a light mist on the mountain, and the half-moon glowed overhead. 
&ldquo;Only spectrograph work can be done in full moonlight, and even that is terribly difficult.&rdquo; Dr. Greenstein said. 
&ldquo;You have to be very careful that the moonlight doesn&#39;t contaminate your plate. 
I thought I&#39;d made a great spectrographic discovery once, only to find that it was the light of the moon, and not of the star. 
There is a gadget called a moon eliminator. I wish we could get rid of the moon for good!&rdquo; 


<br />
Dr. Greenstein glanced at his watch.  
It was eleven o&#39;clock. 
&ldquo;The night&#39;s young yet,&rdquo; he said energetically. 
He went inside, bustled into the control room, checked the dial that counted the ticks, and shut down the spectrograph. 
Tuton slewed the telescope to another star. 
%BD 39°4926. which Dr.  Greenstein explained was also very old and might shed light on whether quasars had to do with galaxy formation. 
Then, since the exposure would last for three hours. 
Dr. Greenstein went downstairs to his darkroom to develop the plate on HD 165195.

Amid a sloshing of water and the acrid odor of hypo Dr. Greenstein said, &ldquo;I don&#39;t really believe that the older stars are residues of quasars.
I don&#39;t believe the quasars are a part of galaxies, and therefore I don&#39;t happen to believe that they have anything to do with star evolution.
There is evidence of giant explosions in galaxies now, but whether these caused quasars or not, we don&#39;t know.
But what we know of quasars really isn&#39;t conducive to the formation of stars.
I don&#39;t believe quasars come from explosions, though other astronomers do.
Speculation is like the stock market.
I feel that the quasars instead may be in some kind of balance condition, like a star, and that they are isolated objects, and that they are formed of matter between galaxies.
Other people feel they are little things which have been blown out of galaxies.
Another group believes that the quasars are extremely dense objects and that their red shifts are caused by gravity, rather than by speed or distance.
I don&#39;t know.
The best we can do is to test the different theories, which is what I&#39;m trying to do now.&rdquo; 


Just after midnight. Dr. Greenstein came up from the darkroom. 
He checked the star, which was ticking away nicely on the slit, and sat on a table. 
&ldquo;That&#39;s all the developing I do tonight,&rdquo; he said. 
&ldquo;It&#39;s too risky when you&#39;re tired.&rdquo; 
He had evidently lost his second wind. 
I asked him if he had been able to tell anything about HD 165195, and he said he hadn&#39;t. 
&ldquo;It&#39;s too late at night for discoveries,&rdquo; he said with a yawn. 
&ldquo;There&#39;s nothing like making a great discovery that you might absent-mindedly wipe off the plate with a wet finger. 
I make it a rule never to make great discoveries after midnight.&rdquo; 


Dr. Greenstein yawned again. 
I followed him over to a couple of reclining chairs by the control console under the north bearing. 
Just visible in the starlight, he lay back with his arms folded behind his head as a pillow and his eyes shut. 
The moon, for the time being, was obscured, so it was unusually dark inside the dome. 
As I became more accustomed to the darkness&mdash;it was much darker than in the control room, which contained a number of luminous dials&mdash;I could make out more and more of the telescope.
Dr.  Greenstein opened his eyes. &ldquo;I could look at it forever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No matter how long you look at it, it always looks different. 
It looks different now, when you can barely see it in the dim starlight, from what it did a few minutes ago in the light of the half-moon. 
It&#39;s different from whatever side you look at it. 
Right now, it just sits there and broods. 
It is a remarkable subordination of brute force for delicate ends. 
All this mechanism is for is to move one piece of glass; and all the glass is for is to carry one thin layer of aluminum that reflects starlight. 
I wish it were quieter! We must get rid of those oil pumps.&rdquo;

At last Dr. Greenstein&#39;s voice drifted off. 
He was fast asleep. 
After a time he sat bolt upright and looked at his watch. 
It was two fifteen. 
Above him, the telescope was almost completely on its side, as if it, too, had been asleep. 
Over the last three hours, its tracking of BD 39&deg; 4926 had caused it to assume this position. 
The ticking ceased abruptly when Dr. Greenstein checked the meter and ended the exposure. 
After rummaging around in the inky coude room to change plates. 
Dr. Greenstein came back to the control room and decided to return to Barnard 29. 
&ldquo;We need about three hours, though with this much moon, I doubt if we&#39;ll get it,&rdquo; he said briskly as he zeroed in the telescope. 
As he was talking, the ticking became more and more sporadic, slowing down; finally it stopped altogether. 
Tuton, who had had no nap, and who looked a little scruffy, went out under the dome and squinted up through the slit. 
Barnard 29 was obscured by clouds again.
&ldquo;What do we do now?&rdquo; Tuton asked Greenstein. 
Tuton said that what he would like to do now would be go home and go to bed. 


&ldquo;We&#39;re getting only about ten minutes&#39; exposure time to the hour, but as long as I can get even that much, I can&#39;t shut down,&rdquo; Dr. Greenstein said, and added unhappily, &ldquo;the telescope&#39;s time is more valuable than my own.&rdquo; 
It costs one thousand dollars a night to operate the telescope. 
Suddenly a great rift appeared in the clouds, and the moon emerged. 
It was greeted with a terrific burst of ticks. Dr. Greenstein shouted to Tuton to shut off the spectrograph. 
&ldquo;We&#39;re belter off wasting exposure time and not getting contamination,&rdquo;
Dr. Greenstein grumbled, exhaling a cloud of cigar smoke that glowed derisively in the moonlight. 
It was a little after two forty-five, and I had the impression that Dr. Greenstein was about to call it a night 


At three fifteen the sky cleared and Tuton started the exposure once more. 
Since he was stiff and tired. 
Dr.  Greenstein suggested another spin around the catwalk. 
There was low-lying mist on the plateau, and not far away a jay woke up raucously. 
The air was chill and damp. 
The east was as dark as ever, but Dr. Greenstein said he could see the zodiacal light, which heralds the dawn. &ldquo;We won&#39;t be able to keep the exposure going much longer,&rdquo; he went on. 
&ldquo;The sun is already beginning to heat up the atmosphere to the east, which makes it bubble a bit.&rdquo; 
Groggily. I looked for bubbles in the east, but saw none. 
A flush of pink appeared and spread rapidly; the stars to the east blinked out, though the ones to the west were, for the time being, as hard and brilliant as they had been for most of the night. 
Shadows grew where none had been before, and we could begin to see colors the green of the pines, the pink clay of the road. 
Dr Greenstein went back inside and called down to Tuton to turn off the exposure before it was contaminated. 


<br />
The inside of the dome was suffused with pink; the dome&#39;s interior, too, was of brilliant aluminum, and caught the dawn through the slit. 
The telescope was visible again, like a dinosaur emerging from a misty bog. 
&ldquo;This is my time on the telescope,&rdquo; Tuton said, &ldquo;the time after dawn, but before all the stars are washed out.
It&#39;s useless for spectrography or photography, so I just aim the telescope at what I want to look at. 
I think Saturn is in a good position for viewing.&rdquo; 


He consulted an astronomy book and quickly swung the telescope to a new position. 
He snapped the eyepiece into place, focusing it. 
He stepped aside, and I took a look. 
There was Saturn, as big as a football and, with its rings forming an oval around it, somewhat the same shape. 
Through the two-hundred-inch telescope, Saturn was so brilliant that it hurt the eyes Dr. Greenstein squinted through the eyepiece, grunting. 
&ldquo;I never particularly liked the solar system,&rdquo; he said, relinquishing the telescope. 
I looked again; Saturn was less brilliant than before, and it was fading fast in the sunlight. 
Soon it vanished altogether, like the Cheshire cat, leaving nothing behind but a patch of paleblue sky.
