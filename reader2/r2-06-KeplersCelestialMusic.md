Since Greek times scientists have insisted that Nature is simple. 
A familiar maxim of Aristotle is. &ldquo;Nature does nothing in vain, nothing superfluous.&rdquo;
Another expression of this philosophy has come down to us from a fourteenth-century English monk and scholar, William of Occam. 
Known as his &ldquo;law of parsimony&rdquo; or &ldquo;Occam&#39;s razor&rdquo; (perhaps for its ruthless cutting away of the superfluous), it maintains, &ldquo;Entities are not to be multiplied without necessity.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer&rdquo; perhaps sums up this attitude. 

We have seen Galileo assume a principle of simplicity in his approach to the problem of accelerated motion, and the literature of modern physical science suggests countless other examples. 
Indeed, present-day physics is in distress, or at least in an uneasy state, because the recently discovered nuclear &ldquo;fundamental particles&rdquo; exhibit a stubborn disinclination to recognize simple laws. 
Only a few decades ago physicists complacently assumed that the proton and the electron were the only &ldquo;fundamental particles&rdquo; they needed to explain the atom. 
But now one &ldquo;fundamental particle&rdquo; after another has crept into the ranks until it appears that there may be as many of them as there are chemical elements. 
Confronted with this bewildering array, the average physicist is tempted to echo Alfonso the Wise and bemoan the fact that he was not consulted first.

once that neither the Ptolemaic nor Copernican system 
was, in any sense of the word, &ldquo;simple.&rdquo; Today we know 
why these systems lacked simplicity: restricting celes- 
tial motion to the circle introduced many otherwise 
unnecessary curves and centers of motion. If astrono- 
mers had used some other curves, notably the ellipse, a 
smaller number of them would have done the job better. 
It was one of Kepler&#39;s great contributions that he stum- 
bled upon this truth. 

Tlie Ellipse and the Keplerian Universe 

The ellipse enables us to center the solar system on ihe 
true sun rather than some &ldquo;mean sun&rdquo; or the center of 
the earth&#39;s orbit as Copernicus did. Thus the Keplerian 
system displays a universe of siars fixed in space, a 
fixed sun, and a single ellipse for the orbit ol each 
planet, with an additional one for the moon. In actual 
fact, most of these ellipses, except for Mercury&#39;s orbit, 
look so much like circles that at first glance the Kep- 
lerian system seems to be the simplified Copernican 
system shown on page 58 of Chapter 3: one circle for 
each planet as it moves around the sun, and another for 
the moon. 

An ellipse (Fig. 22) is not as &ldquo;simple&rdquo; a curve as a 
circle, as will be seen. To draw an ellipse (Fig. 22A), 
stick two pins or thumbtacks into a board, and to them 
tie the ends of a piece of thread. Now draw the curve by 
moving a pencil within the loop of thread so that the 
thread always remains taut. From the method of drawing 
the ellipse, the following defining condition is apparent: 
every point P on the ellipse has the property that the sum 
of the distances from it to two other points F 2 and F t , 
known as the foci, is constant. (The sum is equal to the 
length of the string.) For any pair of foci, the chosen 
length of the string determines the size and shape of the 
ellipse, which may also be varied by using one string-

length and placing the pins near to, or far from, one 
another. Thus an ellipse may have a shape (Fig. 22B) 
with more or less the proportions of an egg, a cigar, or 
a needle, or may be almost round and like a circle. But 
unlike the true egg, cigar, or needle, the ellipse must al- 
ways be symmetrical (Fig. 23) with respect to the axes, 



Minor axis 




Fig. 23. The ellipse is always symmetrical with respect 
to its major and minor axes. 

one of which (the major axis) is a line drawn across the 
ellipse through the foci and the other (the minor axis) 
a line drawn across the ellipse along the perpendicular 
bisector of the major axis. If the two foci are allowed to 
coincide, the ellipse becomes a circle; another way of 
saying this is that the circle is a &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo; form of an 
ellipse. 

The properties of the ellipse were described in an- 
tiquity by Apollonius of Perga, the Greek geometer who 
inaugurated the scheme of epicycles used in Ptolemaic 
astronomy. Apollonius showed that the ellipse, the 
parabola (the path of a projectile according to Galilean 
mechanics), the circle, and another curve called the 
hyperbola may be formed (Fig. 24) by passing planes 
at different inclinations through a right cone, or a cone 
of revolution. But until the time of Kepler and Galileo, 
no one had ever shown that the conic sections occur in 
natural phenomena, notably in the phenomena of mo- 
tion.

Hyperbola 



Fig. 24. The conic sections are obtained by cutting a 
cone in ways shown. Note that the circle is cut parallel 
to the base of the cone, the parabola parallel to one 
side. 

In this work we shall not discuss the stages whereby 
Johannes Kepler came to make his discoveries. Not that 
the subject is devoid of interest. Far from it! But at pres- 
ent we are concerned with the rise of a new physics, as 
it was related to the writings of antiquity, the Middle 
Ages, the Renaissance and the seventeenth century. Aris- 
totle&#39;s books were read widely, and so were the writings 
of Galileo and Newton. Men studied Ptolemy&#39;s Alma- 
gest and Copernicus&#39;s De revolutionibus carefully. But 
Kepler&#39;s writings were not so generally read. Newton, for 
example, knew the works of Galileo but he probably did 
not read Kepler&#39;s books. He may even have acquired 
his knowledge of Kepler&#39;s laws at secondhand, very 
likely from Seth Ward&#39;s textbook on astronomy. Even 



54 



Kepler&#39;s Celestial Music 



today there is no major work of Kepler available in a 
complete English, French, or Italian translation! 

This neglect of Kepler&#39;s texts is not hard to under- 
stand. The language and style were of unimaginable 
difficulty and prolixity, which, in contrast with the clarity 
and vigor of Galileo&#39;s every word, seemetl formidable 
beyond endurance. This is to be expected, for writing 
reflects the personality of the author. Kepler was a tor- 
tured mystic, who stumbled onto his great discoveries in 
a weird groping that has led his most recent biographer,* 
to call him a &ldquo;sleepwalker.&rdquo; Trying to prove one thing, 
he discovered another, and in his calculations he made 
error after error that canceled each other out. He was 
utterly unlike Galileo and Newton; never could their 
purposeful quests for truth conceivably merit the descrip- 
tion of sleepwalking. Kepler, who wrote sketches of 
himself in the third person, said that he became a 
Copernican as a student and that &ldquo;There were three 
things in particular, namely, the number, distances and 
motions of the heavenly bodies, as to which I [Kep- 
ler] searched zealously for reasons why they were as they 
were and not otherwise.&rdquo; About the sun-centered sys- 
tem of Copernicus, Kepler at another time wrote: &ldquo;I certainly know that I owe it this duty: that since I have 
attested it as true in my deepest soul, and since I con- 
template its beauty with incredible and ravishing delight, 
I should also publicly defend it to my readers with all 
the force at my command.&rdquo; But it was not enough to de- 
fend the system; he set out to devote his whole life to 
finding a law or set of laws that would show how the 
system held together, why the planets had the particular 
orbits in which they are found, and why they move as 
they do. 

The first installment in this program, published in 
1596, when Kepler was twenty-five years old, was en-

titled Forerunner of the Dissertations on the Universe, 
containing the Mystery of the Universe. In this book 
Kepler announced what he considered a great discovery 
concerning the distances of the planets from the sun. 
This discovery shows us how rooted Kepler was in the 
Platonic-Pythagorean tradition, how he sought to find 
regularities in nature associated with the regularities of 
mathematics. The Greek geometers had discovered that 
there are five &ldquo;regular solids,&rdquo; which are shown in Fig. 
25. In the Copernican system there are six planets: 





Tetrahedron 



Cube 



Octahedron 




Dodecahedron 




Icosahedron 



Fig. 25. The &ldquo;regular&rdquo; polyhedra. Tetrahedron has 
four faces, each an equilateral triangle. The cube has 
six faces, each a square. The octahedron has eight 
faces, each an equilateral triangle. Each of the dodec- 
ahedron&#39;s twelve faces is an equilateral pentagon. The 
twenty faces of the icosahedron are all equilateral 
triangles. 

Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. Hence it 
occurred to Kepler that five regular solids might separate 
six planetary orbits. 

He started with the simplest of these solids, the cube. 



56 



Kepler&#39;s Celestial Music 



A cube can be circumscribed by one and only one 
sphere, just as one and only one sphere can be inscribed 
in a cube. Hence we may have a cube that is circum- 
scribed by sphere No. 1 and contains sphere No. 2. This 
sphere No. 2 just contains the next regular solid, the 
tetrahedron, which in turn contains sphere No. 3. This 
sphere No. 3 contains the dodecahedron, which in turn 
contains sphere No. 4. Now it happens that in this 
scheme the radii of the successive spheres are in more or 
less the same proportion as the mean distances of the 
planets in the Copernican system except for Jupiter— 
which isn&#39;t surprising, said Kepler, considering how far 
Jupiter is from the sun. The first Keplerian scheme (Fig. 
26), then, was this: 

Sphere of Saturn 

Cube 

Sphere of Jupiter 

Tetrahedron 

Sphere of Mars 

Dodecahedron 

Sphere of Earth 

Icosahedron 

Sphere of Venus 

Octahedron 

Sphere of Mercury. 

&ldquo;I undertake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to prove that God, in creating 
the universe and regulating the order of the cosmos, had 
in view the five regular bodies of geometry as known 
since the days of Pythagoras and Plato, and that He has 
fixed, according to those dimensions, the number of 
heavens, their proportions, and the relations of their 
movements.&rdquo; Even though this book fell short of un- 
qualified success, it established Kepler&#39;s reputation as a 
clever mathematician and as a man who really knew 
something about astronomy. On the basis of this per- 
formance, Tycho Brahe offered him a job.

together, was dearer to his heart than the three laws on

The Keplerian Achievement 

Galileo particularly disliked the idea that solar ema- 
nations or mysterious forces acting at-a-distance could 
affect the earth or any part of the earth. He not only 
rejected Kepler&#39;s suggestion that the sun might be the 
origin of an attractive force moving the earth and planets 
(on which the first two laws of Kepler were based), but 
he especially rejected Kepler&#39;s suggestion that a lu- 
nar force or emanation might cause the tides. Thus he 
wrote: 

&ldquo;But among all the great men who have philoso- 
phized about this remarkable effect, I am more as- 
tonished at Kepler than at any other. Despite his open 
and acute mind, and though he has at his fingertips 
the motions attributed to the earth, he has neverthe- 
less lent his ear and his assent to the moon&#39;s dominion 
over the waters, and to occult properties, and to such 
puerilities.&rdquo; 

As to the harmonic law, or third law, we may ask 
with the voice of Galileo and his contemporaries, Is this 
science or numerology? Kepler already had committed 
himself in print to the belief that the telescope should re- 
veal not only the four satellites of Jupiter discovered by 
Galileo, but two of Mars and eight of Saturn. The reason 
for these particular numbers was that then the number of 
satellites per planet would increase according to a regular 
geometric sequence: 1 (for the earth), 2 (for Mars), 
4 (for Jupiter), 8 (for Saturn). Was not Kepler&#39;s 
distance-period relation something of the same pure 
number-juggling rather than true science? And was not 
evidence for the generally nonscientific aspect of Kep- 
ler&#39;s whole book to be found in the way he tried to fit 
the numerical aspects of the planets&#39; motions and loca- 
tions into the questions posed in the table of contents 
for Book Five of his Harmony of the World?

"1. Concerning the five regular solid figures. 

2. On the kinship between them and the harmonic 
ratios. 

3. Summary of astronomical doctrine necessary for 
speculation into the celestial harmonies. 

4. In what things pertaining to the planetary move- 
ments the simple consonances have been ex- 
pressed and that all those consonances which are 
present in song are found in the heavens. 

5. That the clefs of the musical scale, or pitches of 
the system, and the genera of consonances, the 
major and the minor, are expressed in certain 
movements. 

6. That the single musical Tones or Modes are 
somehow expressed by the single planets. 

7. That the counterpoints or universal harmonies of 
all the planets can exist and be different from one 
another. 

8. That the four kinds of voice are expressed in the 
planets; soprano, contralto, tenor, and bass. 

9. Demonstration that in order to secure this har- 
monic arrangement, those very planetary eccen- 
tricities which any planet has as its own, and no 
others, had to be set up. 

10. Epilogue concerning the sun, by way of very 
fertile conjectures." 



Below are shown the &ldquo;tunes&rdquo; played by the planets in the 
Keplerian scheme.

Kepler&#39;s Celestial Music 
Surely a man of Galileo&#39;s stamp would find it hard to 
consider such a book a serious contribution to celestial 
physics. 

Kepler&#39;s last major book was an Epitome of Coperni- 
can Astronomy, completed for publication nine years 
before his death in 1630. In it he defended his depar- 
tures from the original Copernican system. But what is 
of the most interest to us is that in this book, as in the 
Harmony of the World (1619), Kepler again proudly 
presented his earliest discovery concerning the five regu- 
lar solids and the six planets. It was, he still maintained, 
the reason for the number of planets being six. 

It must have been almost as much work to disentangle 
the three laws of Kepler from the rest of his writings as 
to remake the discoveries. Kepler deserves credit for 
having been the first scientist to recognize that the Co- 
pernican concept of the earth as a planet and Galileo&#39;s 
discoveries demanded that there be one physics— apply- 
ing equally to the celestial objects and ordinary terres- 
trial bodies. But, alas, Kepler remained so enmeshed in 
Aristotelian physics that when he attempted to project 
a terrestrial physics into the heavens, the basis still came 
from Aristotle. Thus the major aim of Keplerian physics 
remained unachieved, and the first workable physics for 
heaven and earth derived not from Kepler but from 
Galileo and attained its form under the magistral guid- 
ance of Isaac Newton.
