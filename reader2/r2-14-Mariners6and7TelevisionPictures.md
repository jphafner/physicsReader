14 Mariners 6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary 
Analysis. 

R. B. Leighton and others* 

An article from Science, 1969. 



Before the space era, Mars was 
thought to be like the earth; after Mari- 
ner 4, Mars seemed to be like the moon; 
Mariners 6 and 7 have shown Mars to 
have its own distinctive features, un- 
known elsewhere within the solar 
system. 

The successful flyby of Mariner 4 
past Mars in July 1965 opened a new 
era in the close-range study of plane- 
tary surfaces with imaging techniques. 
In spite of the limited return of data, 
Mariner 4 established the basic worka- 
bility of one such technique, which in- 
volved use of a vidicon image tube, 
on-board digitization of the video sig- 
nal, storage of the data on magnetic 
tape, transmission to the earth at re- 
duced bit rate by way of a directional 
antenna, and reconstruction into a pic- 
ture under computer control. Even 
though the Mariner 4 pictures covered 
only about 1 percent of Mars&#39;s area, 
they contributed significantly to our 
knowledge of that planet&#39;s surface and 
history (1, 2, 19, 21). 

The objectives of the Mariner 6 and 
7 television experiment were to apply 
the successful techniques of Mariner 4 
to further explore the surface and at- 
mosphere of Mars, both at long range

and at close range, in order to deter- 
mine the basic character of features 
familiar from ground-based telescopic 
studies: to discover possible further 
clues as to the internal state and past 
history of the planet; and to provide 
information germane to the search for 
extraterrestrial life. 

The Mariner 6 and 7 spacecraft suc- 
cessfully flew past Mars on 31 July and 
5 August 1969, respectively: first results 
of the television experiment, based upon 
qualitative study of the uncalibrated 
pictures, have been reported (3, 4). The 
purpose of this article is to draw to- 
gether the preliminary television results 
from the two spacecraft: to present ten- 
tative data concerning crater size distri- 
butions, wall slopes, and geographic 
distribution: to discuss evidences of haze 
or clouds; to describe new, distinctive 
types of topography seen in the pic- 
tures; and to discuss the implications 
of the results with respect to the present 
state, past history, and possible biologi- 
cal status of Mars. 

The data presented here and in the 
two earlier reports were obtained from 
inspection and measurement of a par- 
tial sample of pictures in various stages 
of processing. As such, the results must 
be regarded as tentative, subject to con- 
siderable expansion and possible modi- 
fication as more complete sets, and 
better-quality versions, of the pictures 
become available over a period of sev- 
eral months. They are offered at this 



95 



time because of their unique nature, 
their wide interest, and their obvious 
relevance to the forthcoming Mariner 
1971 (orbiter) and Viking 1973 (lander) 
missions. 

Television System Design 

The experience and results of Mari- 
ner 4 strongly influenced the basic de- 
sign of the Mariner 6 and 7 television 
experiment. The earlier pictures showed 
Mars to be heavily cratered, but to 
have subdued surface relief and low 
photographic contrast, and possibly to 
have a hazy atmosphere. It was also 
found that a vidicon-type camera tube 
has a most important property: the 
"target noise," analogous to photo- 
graphic grain, is less than that of a 
photographic emulsion by perhaps a 
factor of 10 (2) and is the same from 
picture to picture. Thus the 64-level (6- 
bit) encoding scheme of Mariner 4 was 
able to cope with the extremely low 
contrast conditions because intensity 
calibration and contrast enhancement 
by computer techniques could be effec- 
tively applied to the data to produce 
pictures of useful quality. 

Early design studies for Mariner 6 
and 7 centered around 256-level (8-bit) 
encoding — at least a tenfold increase in 
data return over that from Mariner 4; 
overlapping two-color coverage along 
the picture track (similar to that of 
Mariner 4); use of two cameras of dif- 
ferent focal lengths to provide higher- 
resolution views of areas nested within 
overlapping, wider-angle frames; and 
use of the camera of longer focal 
length to obtain a few full-disk photo 
graphs showing all sides of Mars as the 
spacecraft approached the planet. A 
third filter color, "blue," was added to 
the "red" and "green" of Mariner 4 
for the purpose of studying atmospheric 
effects. 

Limitations of volume, money, and 
schedule prevented use of a suitable 
digital recorder system with the nec- 
essary data storage capacity, but. 
through a hybrid system which uses both 
digital and analog tape recorders, it ap- 



peared possible to achieve sufficient data 
storage capacity, albeit at the expense 
of complexity. 

In its final form, the television ex- 
periment employed a two-camera system 
in which the picture formats and elec- 
tronic circuits of the cameras were iden- 
tical (for economy and for efficient use 
of the tape recorders); a digital tape 
recorder to store the six lowest-order 
bits of an 8-bit encoded word for every 
seventh picture element ("pixel") 
along each TV picture line (referred to 
as 1/7 digital data; see 5); and a second, 
similar tape recorder to store analog 
data for all pixels (6). . . . 

Some technical data relating to the 
camera system are given in Leighton et 
al. (5), and more complete data will 
be given elsewhere (6). Briefly, one 
camera, called camera A, has a field of 
view 11° x 14° and a rotary shutter 
which carries four colored filters in the 
sequence red. green, blue, green, and 
so on. Alternating exposures with cam- 
era A is camera B, which has a focal 
length 10 times as great and a field of 
view l°.l x l.°4. Camera B carries 
only a minus-blue haze filter.... 

To illustrate the nature of the picture 
restoration process, we list some of the 
steps in the computer reduction: Restore 
the two highest-order bits to the digital 
data (7); remove effects of AGC and 
"cuber" in the analog data: combine 
digital and analog data; measure and 
remove electronic "pickup" noise (7); 
measure pixel locations of reseau marks 
on flight pictures and calibration pic- 
tures (8)\ bring pictorial calibration 
and flight data, by interpolation, into 
agreement with the known reseau pat- 
tern: measure and correct for optical 
distortions: measure and remove effects 
of residual image from calibration and 
flight data: evaluate the sensitometric 
response of each pixel from calibration 
data and deduce the true photometric 
exposure for each flight pixel (9); cor- 
rect for the effects of shutter-speed vari- 
ations and light leakage (camera B); 
and evaluate and correct for the modu- 
lation-transfer function of the camera 
system. . . .

Mission Design and 
Television Data Return 

As was described in Leighton et al. 
(3), the planetary encounter period for 
each spacecraft was divided into two 
parts: a far-encounter (FE) period be- 
ginning 2 or 3 days prior to, and ex- 
tending to within a few hours of, closest 
approach, and a near-encounter (NE) 
period bracketing the time of closest 
approach .... 

In all, 50 FE pictures, 26 NE 
pictures, and 428 useful (10) real-time 
1/7 digital pictures were returned from 
Mariner 6, and 93 FE pictures, 33 NE 
pictures, and 749 useful real-time digital 
pictures were returned from Mariner 7. 
This further ninefold increase in the 
number of FE pictures and 18 percent 
increase in the number of NE pictures 
over the original plan represents a total 
data return 200 times that of Mariner 
4, not counting the real-time digital 
frames. 

The pictures are designated by space- 
craft, camera mode, and frame number. 



Mariners 6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary Analysis 

Thus "6N17&#39; means Mariner 6 NE 
frame 17: "7F77" means Mariner 7 FE 
frame 77; and so on. The first NE pic- 
ture from each spacecraft was a camera- 
A, blue-filter picture. Thus, in near- 
encounter, all odd-numbered frames 
are camera-A (wide-angle, low-resolu- 
tion) frames. . . . 

The approximate near-encounter pic- 
ture locations for the two spacecraft are 
shown in Fig. 3, and the relevant data 
are given in Tables 1 and 2. The pic- 
ture tracks were chosen, in concert with 
investigators for other on-board experi- 
ments, on the basis of several consider- 
ations and constraints. First, the choice 
of possible arrival dates was limited by 
engineering considerations to the inter- 
val 31 July to 15 August 1969. Second, 
on any given arrival date, the time 
of closest approach was limited to an 
interval of about 1 hour by the require- 
ment that the spacecraft be in radio 
view of Goldstone tracking station dur- 
ing a period of several hours which 
bracketed the time of closest approach. 
These two constraints and the approxi- 
mate 24-hour rotation period of Mars

considerably limited the possible longi- 
tudes of Mars that could effectively be 
viewed; in particular, the most promi- 
nent dark area, Syrtis Major, could not 
be seen under optimum conditions. 
Fortunately, Meridiani Sinus, a promi- 
nent dark area almost as strong and 
permanent as Syrtis Major, and various 
other important features well known 
from Earth observation, were easily 
accessible. . . . 

The cameras and other instruments 
were mounted on a two-axis "scan plat- 
form" which could be programmed to 
point the instruments in as many as five 
successive directions during the near- 
encounter. The particular orbit and 
platform-pointing strategy adopted for 
each spacecraft was designed to achieve 
the best possible return of scientific 
data within a context of substantial 
commonality but with some divergence 
of needs of the various experiments. 
The television experimenters placed 
great weight upon viewing a wide va- 
riety of classical features, including the 
polar cap; continuity of picture cover- 
age; substantial two-color overlap and 
some three-color overlap if possible; 
stereoscopic overlap; viewing the planet 
limb in blue light; viewing the same area 
at two different phase angles; and see- 
ing the same area under different view- 
ing conditions at nearly the same phase 
angle. . . . 

The Mariner 6 picture track was 
chosen to cover a broad longitude range 
at low latitudes in order to bring into 
view a number of well-studied transi- 
tional zones between light and dark 
areas, two "oases" (Juventae Fons and 
Oxia Palus). and a variable light re- 
gion (Deucalionis Regio). The picture 
track of Mariner 7 was selected so that 
it would cross that of Mariner 6 on the 
dark area Meridiani Sinus, thereby pro- 
viding views of that important region 
under different lighting conditions. The 
track was also specifically arranged to 
include the south polar cap and cap 
edge, to intersect the "wave-of-darken- 
ing" feature Hellespontus, and to cross 
the classical bright circular desert 
Hellas 



Camera Operation and 
Picture Appearance 

The first impression of Mars con- 
veyed by the pictures is that the surface 
is generally visible and is not obscured 
by clouds or haze except perhaps in 
the polar regions and in a few areas 
marked by the appearance of afternoon 
"clouds." The classical martian features 
stand out clearly in the far-encounter 
pictures, and, as the image grows, these 
features transform into areas having 
recognizable relationships to the num- 
erous craters which mark the surface. 
The near-encounter pictures seem to 
show a Moon-like terrain. However, 
one must bear in mind the fact that 
the camera system was designed to en- 
hance the contrast of local brightness 
fluctuations by a factor of 3, and that 
the contrast of the pictures is often 
further enhanced in printing. Actually, 
although the surface is generally visible, 
its contrast is much less than that of the 
moon under similar lighting conditions. 
Fewer shadows are seen near the ter- 
minator. 

The determination of true surface 
contrast depends critically upon the 
amount of haze or veiling glare in the 
picture field. Although the pictures ap- 
pear to be free of such effects, more 
refined photometric measurements may 
well reveal the presence of veiling glare 
or a general atmospheric haze. Definite 
conclusions must await completion of 
the photometric reduction of the pic- 
tures, including corrections for vidicon 
dark current, residual images, shutter 
light leaks, and possible instrumental 
scattering 



Observed Atmospheric Features 

Aerosol scattering. Clear-cut evidence 
for scattering layers in the atmosphere 
is provided by the pictures of the north- 
eastern limb of Mariner 7. The limb ap- 
pears in frames 7N1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and 
in a few real-time digital A-camera 
frames received immediately prior to 
frame 7N 1 . . . .

Mariners 6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary Analysis 



The real-time digital data reveal an 
apparent limb haze near the south polar 
cap, and over the regions of Mare Ha- 
driaticum and Ausonia just east of Hel- 
las. The haze over these regions is not 
as bright as the haze discussed above, so 
it is unlikely that it is sufficiently dense 
to obscure surface features seen at NE 
viewing angles. A faint limb haze may 
also be present in the Mariner 6 limb 
frames. 

The "blue haze." Despite these evi- 
dences of very thin aerosol hazes, visi- 
ble tangentially on the limb, there is no 
obscuring "blue haze" sufficient to ac- 
count for the normally poor visibility 
of dark surface features seen or photo- 
graphed in blue light and for their 
occasional better visibility — the so- 
called "blue-clearing" phenomenon (11, 
12). 

The suitability of the Mariner blue 
pictures for "blue haze" observations 
was tested by photographing Mars 
through one of the Mariner blue filters 
on Eastman III-G plates, whose response 
in this spectral region is similar to that 
of the vidicons used in the Mariner 
camera. Conventional blue photographs 
on unsensitized emulsions and green 
photographs were taken for comparison. 
A typical result is shown in Fig. 5; the 
simulated TV blue picture is very simi- 
lar to the conventional blue photographs. 



The blue pictures taken by Mariners 
6 and 7 clearly show craters and other 



surface features, even near the limb 
and terminator, where atmospheric ef- 
fects are strong. Polar cap frame 
7N17 shows sharp surface detail very 
near the terminator. The blue limb 
frame 6N1 shows surface detail corre- 
sponding to that seen in the subsequent 
overlapping green frame 6N3. Figure 
6 includes blue, green, and red pictures 
in the region of Sinus Meridiani. Al- 
though craters show clearly in all three 
colors, albedo variations, associated 
both with craters and with larger-scale 
features, are much more pronounced 
in green and red than in blue. Blue 
photographs obtained from the earth 
during the Mariner encounters show 
the normal "obscured" appearance of 
Mars. 

South polar cap shading. Another 
possible indication of atmospheric haze 
is the remarkable darkening of the 
south polar cap near both limb and 
terminator in the FE pictures (Fig. 7). 
This darkening is plainly not due to 
cloud or thick haze since, during near- 
encounter, surface features are clearly 
visible everywhere over the polar cap. 
It may be related to darkening seen in 
NE Mariner 7 frames near the polar 
cap terminator, and to the decrease in 
contrast with increasing viewing angle 
between the cap and the adjacent mare 
seen in frame 7N11 (Fig. 8b). The 
darkening may be due to optically thin 
aerosol scattering over the polar cap, 
or possibly to unusual photometric be- 
havior of the cap itself. In either case,

it may be complicated by systematic 
diurnal or latitudinal effects. 

North polar phenomena. Marked 
changes seem to have occurred, between 
the flybys of Mariners 6 and 7, in the 
appearance of high northern latitudes. 
Some of these changes are revealed by 
a comparison of frames 6F34 and 7F73. 
which correspond to approximately the 
same central meridian and distance from 
Mars (Fig. 7). A large bright tongue 
(point 1 in frame 73) and a larger 
bright region near the limb (point 2) 
appear smaller and fainter in the Mari- 
ner 7 picture, despite the generally 
higher contrast of Mariner 7 FE frames. 
Much of the brightening near point 2 
has disappeared entirely between the 
two flybys; in fact, it was not visible at 
all on pictures taken by Mariner 7 
during the previous Mars rotation, al- 
though it was clearly visible in several 
Mariner 6 frames taken over the same 
range of distances. The bright tongue 
(point 1) increases in size and bright- 



ness during the martian day. as may be 
clearly seen from a comparison of 
frames 7F73 and 7F76 (Fig. 7). 

The widespread, diffuse brightening 
covering much of the north polar cap 
region (point 3) apparently corre- 
sponds to the "polar hood" which has 
been observed from the earth at this 
martian season (northern early au- 
tumn). The extent of this hood is small- 
er in Mariner 7 than in Mariner 6 
pictures: the region between, and just 
north of, points 1 and 2 appears to be 
covered by the hood in the Mariner 6 
frames, but shows no brightening in 
the Mariner 7 frames. 

The diffeient behaviors of the discrete 
bright regions and the hood suggest 
different origins for these features, al- 
though both apparently are either at- 
mospheric phenomena or else result 
from the interaction of the atmosphere 
and the surface. The discrete bright 
regions have fixed locations suggesting 
either surface frost or orographically

fixed clouds. The fluctuation in the 
areal extent of the diffuse hood suggests 
cloud or haze. An extensive cloud or 
haze composed of either CO_. or CO. 
and H..O ice would be consistent with 



viewing of overlapping regions whose 
stereo angles lie between 5° and 12°. 
Little or no illumination is evident near 
and beyond the polar cap terminator.

Search for local clouds and foi&gt;. All 
NE frames from both spacecraft were 
carefully examined for evidences of 
clouds or fog. Away from the south 
polar cap there are no evidences of such 
atmospheric phenomena. Over the polar 
cap and near its edge a number of bright 
features which may be atmospheric can 
be seen, although no detectable shadows 
are present and no local differences in 
height can be detected by stereoscopic 



and 13 (Fig. 8) show several diffuse 
bright patches suggestive of clouds near 
the polar cap edge. Also, on the cap 
itself a few local diffuse bright patches 
are present in frames 7N15 (green) 
and 7N17 (blue). Unlike most polar 
cap craters, which appear sharp and 
clear, a few crater rims and other 
topographic forms appear diffuse 
(frames 7NI7, 18. and 19). In frames 
7N17 (blue) and 7N19 (green), 
remarkable curved, quasi-parallel bright 
streaks are visible near the south pole 
itself. While these show indications

of topographic form or control, includ- 
ing some crater-like shapes, their pos- 
sible cloud-like nature is suggested by 
lack of shading. . . . 

Observed Surface Features 

A primary objective of the Mariner 
6 and 7 television experiment was to 
examine, at close range, the principal 
types of martian surface features seen 
from the earth. 

Mariners 6 and 7, while confirming 
the earlier evidence of a Moon-like 
cratered appearance for much of the 
martian surface, have also revealed sig- 
nificantly different terrains suggestive of 
more active, and more recent, surface 
processes than were previously evident. 
Preliminary analyses indicate that at 
least three distinctive terrains are repre- 
sented in the pictures, as well as a mix- 
ture of permanent and transitory surface 
features displayed at the edge of, and 
within, the south polar cap; these ter- 
rains do not exhibit any simple correla- 
tion with the light and dark markings 
observed from the earth. 

Cratered terrains. Cratered terrains 
are those parts of the martian surface 
upon which craters are the dominant 
topographic form (Fig. 6). Pictures from 
Mariners 4, 6, and 7 all suggest that 
cratered terrains are widespread in the 
southern hemisphere. 

Knowledge of cratered terrains in the 
northern hemisphere is less complete. 
Cratered areas appear in some Mariner 
frames as far north as latitude 20°. Nix 
Olympica, which in far-encounter 
photographs appears to be an unusually 
large crater, lies at 18°N. Numerous 
craters are visible in the closer-range 
FE frames. These are almost exclusively 
seen in the dark areas lying in the 
southern hemisphere, few being visible 
in the northern hemisphere. This differ- 
ence may result from an enhancement 
of crater visibility by reflectivity varia- 
tions in dark areas. However, poor pho- 
tographic coverage, highly oblique 
views, and unfavorable sun angles com- 
bine to limit our knowledge of the 
northern portion of the planet. 



Preliminary measurements of the 
diameter-frequency distribution of mar- 
tian craters in the region Deucalionis 
Regio were made on frames 6N19 to 
6N22 and are shown in Fig. 9a. The 
curves are based upon 104 craters more 
than 0.7 kilometer in diameter seen on 
frames 6N20 and 22, and upon 256 
craters more than 7 kilometers in diam- 
eter seen on frames 6N19 and 21. The 
most significant result is the existence of 
two different crater distributions, a 
dichotomy also apparent in morphology. 
The two morphological crater types are 
(i) large and flat-bottomed and (ii) 
small and bowl-shaped. Flat-bottomed 
craters are most evident on frames 
6N19 and 6N21. The diameters range 
from a few kilometers to a few hundred 
kilometers, with estimated diameter-to- 
depth ratios on the order of 100 to 1. 
The smaller, bowl-shaped craters are 
best observed in frames 6N20 and 
6N22 and resemble lunar primary- 
impact craters. Some of them appear to 
have interior slopes steeper than 20 
degrees .... 

On frame 6N20 there are low irregu- 
lar ridges similar to those seen on the 
lunar maria. However, no straight or 
sinuous rills have been identified with 
confidence. Similarly, no Earth-like tec- 
tonic forms possibly associated with 
mountain building, island-arc formation, 
or compressional deformation have been 
recognized. 

Chaotic terrains. Mariner frames 
6N6, 14, and 8 (Fig. 10a) show two 
types of terrain — a relatively smooth 
cratered surface that gives way abruptly 
to irregularly shaped, apparently lower 
areas of chaotically jumbled ridges. 
This chaotic terrain seems characteris- 
tically to display higher albedo than its 
surroundings. On that basis, we infer 
that significant parts of the overlapping 
frames 6N5, 7, and 15 may contain 
similar terrain, although their resolution 
is not great enough to reveal the general 
morphological characteristics. As shown 
in Fig. 10a, frames 6N6, 14, and 8 all 
lie within frame 6N7, for which an 
interpretive map of possible chaotic ter- 
rain extent has been prepared (Fig. 11).

cap edge, (b) Composite of poplar cap camera- A frames 7N11 to 7N19. The effects of AGC have been partially corrected, but con- 
trast is enhanced. The south pole lies near the parallel streaks in the lower right corner of frame 7N17. 



About 10 G square kilometers of cha- 
otic terrain may lie within the strip, 
1000 kilometers wide and 2000 kilo- 
meters long, covered by these Mariner 
6 wide-angle frames. Frames 6N9 and 
10 contain faint suggestions of similar 
features. This belt lies at about 20°S, 
principally within the poorly defined, 
mixed light-and-dark area between the 
dark areas Aurorae Sinus and Marga- 
ritifer Sinus. 

Chaotic terrain consists of a highly 
irregular plexus of short ridges and de- 
pressions, 1 to 3 kilometers wide and 2 



to 10 kilometers long, best seen in 
frame 6N6 (Fig. 10a). Although irregu- 
larly jumbled, this terrain is different in 
setting and pattern from crater ejecta 
sheets. Chaotic terrain is practically 
uncratered; only three faint possible 
craters are recognized in the 10 G -square- 
kilometer area. The patches of chaotic 
terrain are not all integrated, but they 
constitute an irregular pattern with an 
apparent N to N 30°E grain. 

Featureless terrains. The floor of the 
bright circular "desert," Hellas, cen- 
tered at about 40°S, is the largest area 



103 



of featureless terrain so far identified. 
Even under very low solar illumination 
the area appears devoid of craters down 
to the resolution limit of about 300 
meters. No area of comparable size and 
smoothness is known on the moon. It 
may be that all bright circular "deserts" 
of Mars have smooth featureless floors; 
however, in the present state of our 
knowledge it is not possible to define 
any significant geographic relationship 
for featureless terrains. . . . 

South polar cap features. The edge of 
the martian south polar cap was visible 
at close range over a 90° span of longi- 
tude, from 290 °E to 20 °E, and the cap 
itself was seen over a latitude range 
from its edge, at -60°, southward to, 
and perhaps beyond, the pole itself. 
Solar zenith angles ranged from 51° to 
90° and more; the terminator is clearly 
visible in one picture. The phase angle 
for the picture centers was 35°. The 
superficial appearance is that of a 
clearly visible, moderately cratered sur- 
face covered with a varying thickness of 
"snow." The viewing angle and the un- 
familiar surface conditions make quan- 
titative comparison with other areas of 
Mars difficult with respect to the num- 
ber and size distributions of craters. 
Discussion here is therefore confined to 
those qualitative aspects of the polar 
cap which seem distinctive to that 
region. 

The edge of the cap was observed in 
the FE pictures to be very nearly at 
60°S, as predicted from Lowell Observ- 
atory measurements (15); this lends 
confidence to Earth-based observations 
concerning the past behavior of the 
polar caps. 

The principal effect seen at the cap 
edge is a spectacular enhancement of 
crater visibility and the subtle appear- 
ance of other topographic forms. In 
frames 7N11 to 7N13, where the local 
solar zenith angle was about 53°, craters 
are visible both on and off the cap. How- 
ever, in the transition zone, about 2 
degrees of latitude in width, the popu- 
lation density of visible craters is sev- 
eral times greater, and may equal any 
so far seen on Mars. This enhancement 



of crater visibility results mostly from 
the tendency, noted in Mariner 4 pic- 
tures 14 and 15, for snow to lie prefer- 
entially on poleward-facing slopes. 

In frame 7N12 the cap edge is seen 
in finer detail. The tendency mentioned 
above is here so marked as to cause con- 
fusion concerning the direction of the 
illumination. There are several tiny 
craters as small as 0.7 kilometer in di- 
ameter, and areas of fine mottling and 
sinuous lineations are seen near the 
larger craters. The largest crater shows 
interesting grooved structure, near its 
center and on its west inner wall, which 
appears similar to that in frame 6N18. 

On the cap itself, the wide-angle views 
show many distinct reflectivity varia- 
tions, mostly related to moderately large 
craters but not necessarily resulting 
from slope-illumination effects. Often a 
crater appears to have a darkened floor 
and a bright rim, and in some craters 
having central peaks the peaks seem un- 
usually prominent. In frames 7N17 and 
7N19 several large craters seem to have 
quite dark floors.

In contrast, the high-resolution polar 
cap frames 7N14 to 7N20 suggest a 
more uniformly coated surface whose 
brightness variations are mostly due to 
the effects of illumination upon local 
relief. . . . 

Some of the classical "oases" ob- 
served from the earth have now been 
identified with single, large, dark-floored 
craters (such as Juventae Fons. see 4 
and Fig. 4) or groups of such craters 
(such as Oxia Palus, frame 7N5). At 
least two classical "canals" (Cantabras 
and Gehon) have been found to coincide 
with quasi-linear alignment of several 
dark-floored craters, shown also in 
frame 7N5 (Fig. 13). As reported else- 
where (4), other canals are composed of 
irregular dark patches. It is probable 
that most canals will, upon closer in- 
spection, prove to be associated with a 
variety of physiographic features, and 
that eventually they will be considered 
less distinctive as a class. . . . 



Mariners 6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary Analysis 
Inferences concerning Processes 
and Surface History 



The features observed in the Mariner 
6 and 7 pictures are the result of both 
present and past processes; therefore, 
they provide the basis of at least limited 
conjecture about those processes and 
their variations through time. In this 
section we consider the implications of 
(i) the absence of Earth-like tectonic 
features; (ii) the erosion, blanketing, 
and secondary modification evidenced in 
the three principal terrains; and (iii) 
the probable role of equilibrium be- 
tween CO., solid and vapor in the for- 
mation of features of the south polar 
cap. We also consider the possible role 
of equilibrium between HO solid and 
vapor as an explanation of the diurnal 
brightenings observed in the FE photo- 
graphs and biological implications.

tectonic features on Mars indicates 
that, for the time period represented by 
the present large martian topographic 
forms, the crust of Mars has not been 
subjected to the kinds of internal forces 
that have modified, and continue to 
modify, the surface of the earth. 

Inasmuch as the larger craters prob- 
ably have survived from a very early 
time in the planet&#39;s history, it is in- 
ferred that Mars&#39;s interior is, and prob- 
ably has always been, much less active 
than the earth&#39;s (79). Furthermore, 
a currently held view (20) is that the 
earth&#39;s dense, aqueous atmosphere may 
have formed early, in a singular event 
associated with planetary differentiation 
and the origin of the core. To the ex- 
tent, therefore, that surface tectonic 
features may be related in origin to the 
formation of a dense atmosphere, their 
absence on Mars independently suggests 
that Mars never had an Earth-like at- 
mosphere. 



Age implications of cratered terrains. 
At present, the ages of martian topo- 
graphic forms can be discussed only by 
comparison with the moon. Both the 
moon and Mars exhibit heavily cratered 
and lightly cratered areas, which evi- 
dently reflect in each case regional dif- 
ferences in the history of, or the re- 
sponse to, meteoroidal bombardment 
over the total life-span of the surfaces. 
The existence of a thin atmosphere on 
Mars may have produced recognizable 
secondary effects in the form and size 
distribution of craters, by contrast with 
the moon, where a significant atmo- 
sphere has presumably never been 
present. To the extent that relative 
fluxes of large objects impinging upon 
the two bodies can be determined, or 
a common episodic history established, 
a valid age comparison may be hoped 
for, except in the extreme case of a 
saturated cratered surface, where only 
a lower limit to an age can be found.

Mariners 

It is a generally accepted view that 
the present crater density on the lunar 
uplands could not have been produced 
within the 4.5-billion-year age of the 
solar system had the bombardment rate 
been no greater than the estimated 
present rate; that is, the inferred mini- 
mum age is already much greater than 
is considered possible. Indeed, it is 
found that even the sparsely cratered 
lunar maria would have required about 
a billion years to attain their present 
crater density. Unless this discrepancy 
is somehow removed by direct measure- 
ments of the crystallization ages of re- 
turned samples of lunar upland and 
mare materials, the previously accepted 
implication of an early era of high 
bombardment followed by a long pe- 
riod of bombardment at a drastically 
reduced rate will presumably stand. 

In the case of Mars, a bombardment 
rate per unit area as much as 25 times 
that on the moon has been estimated 
(27). However, even this would still 
seem to require at least several billion 
years to produce the density of large 
craters that is seen on Mars in the more 
heavily cratered areas (19). Thus these 
areas could also be primordial. Further, 
were these areas to have actually been 
bombarded at a constant rate for such 
a time, at least a few very recent, large 
craters should be visible, including sec- 
ondary craters and other local effects. 
Instead, the most heavily cratered areas 
seem relatively uniform with respect 
to the degree of preservation of large 
craters, with no martian Tycho or Co- 
pernicus standing out from the rest. This 
again suggests an early episodic history 
rather than a continuous history for 
cratered martian terrain, and increases 
the likelihood that cratered terrain is 
primordial. 

If areas of primordial terrain do 
exist on Mars, an important conclusion 
follows: these areas have never been 
subject to erosion by water. This in 
turn reduces the likelihood that a dense, 
Earth-like atmosphere and large, open 
bodies of water were ever present on 
the planet, because these would almost 
surely have produced high rates of 



6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary Analysis 

planet-wide erosion. On the earth, no 
topographic form survives as long as 
10 8 years unless it is renewed by up- 
lift or other tectonic activity. 

Implications of modification of ter- 
rain. Although erosional and blanketing 
processes on Mars have not been strong 
enough to obliterate large craters within 
the cratered terrains, their effects are 
easily seen. On frames 6N19 and 6N21 
(Fig. 6), even craters as large as 20 to 
50 kilometers in diameter appear scarce 
by comparison with the lunar uplands 
[a feature originally noted by Hartmann 
(19) on the basis of the Mariner 4 
data], and the scarcity of smaller cra- 
ters is marked. The latter have a rel- 
atively fresh appearance, however, 
which suggests an episodic history of 
formation, modification, or both. Such 
a history seems particularly indicated 
by the apparently bimodal crater fre- 
quency distribution of Fig. 9. 

Marked erosion, blanketing, and 
other surface processes must have been 
operating almost up to the present in 
the areas of featureless and chaotic ter- 
rains; only this could account for the 
absence of even small craters there. 
These processes may not be the same 
as those at work on the cratered ter- 
rains, because large craters have also 
been erased. The cratered terrains ob- 
viously have never been affected by such 
processes; this indicates an enduring 
geographic dependence of these extraor- 
dinary surface processes. 

The chaotic terrain gives a general 
impression of collapse structures, sug- 
gesting the possibility of large-scale 
withdrawal of substances from the un- 
derlying layers. The possibility of per- 
mafrost some kilometers thick, and of 
its localized withdrawal, may deserve 
further consideration. Magmatic with- 
drawal or other near-surface disturb- 
ance associated with regional volcanism 
might be another possibility, but the 
apparent absence of extensive volcanic 
terrains on the surface would seem to 
be a serious obstacle to such an inter- 
pretation. It may also be that chaotic 
terrain is the product either of some 
unknown intense and localized ero-

sional process or of unsuspected local 
sensitivity to a widespread process. 

Carbon dioxide condensation effects. 
The Mariner 7 NE pictures of the polar 
cap give no direct information concern- 
ing the material or the thickness of the 
polar snow deposit, since the observed 
brightness could be produced by a very 
few milligrams per square centimeter 
of any white, powdery material. How- 
ever, they do provide important indirect 
evidence as to the thickness of the de- 
posit and, together with other known 
factors, may help to establish its com- 
position. 

The relatively normal appearance of 
craters on the polar cap in the high- 
resolution frames, and the existence on 
these same frames of topographic relief 
unlike that so far recognized elsewhere 
on the planet, suggest that some of the 
apparent relief may be due to variable 
thicknesses of snow, perhaps drifted by 
wind. If it is, local thicknesses of at 
least several meters are indicated. 

The structure of the polar cap edge 
shows that evaporation of the snow is 
strongly influenced by local slopes — 
that is, by insolation effects rather than 
by wind. On the assumption that the 
evaporation is entirely determined by 
the midday radiation balance, when the 
absorbed solar power exceeds the ra- 
diation loss at the appropriate frost- 
point temperature, one may estimate the 
daily evaporation loss from the cap. We 
find the net daily loss to be about 0.8 
gram per square centimeter in the case 
of CO,, although the loss is reduced by 
overnight recondensation. In the case 
of H.O, the loss would be about 0.08 
gram per square centimeter, and it 
would be essentially irreversible because 
H.O is a minor constituent whose de- 
position is limited by diffusion. 

Since the complete evaporation of 
the cap at a given latitude requires 
many days, we may multiply the above 
rates by a factor between 10 and 100, 
obtaining estimates for total cap thick- 
ness of tens of grams per square centi- 
meter for CO. and several grams per 
square centimeter for H.O, on the as- 
sumption that the cap is composed of 



6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary Analysis 

one or the other of these materials. The 
estimate for CO L . is quite acceptable, but 
that for H.O is unacceptable because of 
the problem of transporting such quan- 
tities annually from one pole to the 
other at the observed vapor density 
(22). For the remainder of this dis- 
cussion we assume the polar cap to be 
composed of CO.. with a few milli- 
grams of H.O per square centimeter 
deposited throughout the layer. 

Several formations have been ob- 
served which suggest a tendency for 
snow to be preferentially removed from 
low areas and deposited on high areas, 
contrary to what might be expected 
under quiescent conditions (23). These 
formations include craters with dark 
floors and bright rims, prominent cen- 
tral peaks in some craters, and irregu- 
lar depressed areas (frames 7N14, 15, 
and 17). While such effects might result 
simply from wind transport of solid 
material, it is also possible that inter- 
change of solid and vapor plays a role. 

Water: processes suggested by bright- 
ening phenomena. Several of the bright- 
ening and haze phenomena described 
above could be related either to forma- 
tion of H 2 frost on the surface or to 
formation of H.O ice clouds in the 
atmosphere. In most of these instances, 
however, the phenomena could equally 
well be explained by condensation of 
CO.. This is true of the bright tongues 
and polar hood in the north polar re- 
gion, of the cloud-like features observed 
over and near the south polar cap, and 
of the limb hazes observed in tropical 
latitudes and over the Mare Hadriati- 
cum and Ausonia regions. 

On the other hand, the brightenings 
in the Nix Olympica, Tharsis, Candor, 
and Tractus Albus regions cannot be 
explained by CO. condensation be- 
cause their complete topographic con- 
trol requires that they be on or near the 
surfaces where temperatures are well 
above the CO. frost point. An explana- 
tion of these phenomena in terms of 
H.O condensation processes also faces 
serious difficulties, however. Most of 
the region is observed to brighten dur- 



109 



ing the forenoon, when the surface is 
hotter than either the material below 
or the atmosphere above, so that water 
vapor could not diffuse toward the sur- 
face and condense on it, either from 
above or below. Thus a surface ice-frost 
is very unlikely. A few features in the 
area, parts of the "W-cloud," for ex- 
ample, are observed to brighten mark- 
edly during the late afternoon, where 
H.O frost could form on the surface if 
the air were sufficiently saturated. These 
features are not observed, from the 
earth, to be bright in the early morning, 
but a thin layer of H.O frost persisting 
through the night would evaporate al- 
most immediately when illuminated by 
the early morning sun, provided the air 
were then sufficiently dry. Under these 
conditions, the behavior of the "W- 
cloud" could be due to frost. 

The diurnal behavior of the bright 
regions throughout this part of Mars 
is consistent with a theory of convective 
H 2 ice clouds, but the absence of any 
cloud-like morphology and the clear to- 
pographic detail observed at the high- 
est resolution available (frame 7F76) 
render this explanation questionable. 
Even very light winds of 5 meters per 
second would produce easily observable 
displacements of the order of 100 kilo- 
meters in the course of the more than 
one-fourth of the Mars day during 
which these regions were continuously 
observed by each spacecraft. Since con- 
densation and evaporation processes are 
slow at Mars temperatures and pres- 
sures, some observable distortion and 
streakiness due to these displacements 
should be seen in clouds, even if they 
are orographically produced. No such 
distortions or streakiness are observed. 
An additional difficulty with an ex- 
planation of these phenomena in terms 
of H.O condensation lies in the rela- 
tively rapid removal of water from 
the local surface. Water vapor evolved 
from the surface during the daytime 
would quickly be transported upward 
through a deep atmospheric layer by 
thermal convection, and most of it 
would be removed from the source re- 



gion. Local permafrost sources should 
be effectively exhausted by this mecha- 
nism within a few hundred years at 
most, unless somehow replenished. Since 
most of this region lies near the equator, 
where seasonal temperature variations 
are small, it is difficult to see how any 
significant seasonal replenishment from 
the atmosphere could take place. The 
possibility of replenishment from a sub- 
surface source of liquid water is not. 
considered here. 

In summary, in our examination of 
the data thus far, we see no strong in- 
dications of H.O processes involving 
vapor and ice. The brightenings seen 
in the tropics and subtropics at far-en- 
counter are not easily explained by a 
mechanism involving H..O. On the other 
hand, we have no satisfactory alterna- 
tive explanation for these phenomena. 
Perhaps detailed exploration of these 
regions by the Mariner &#39;71 orbiters will 
provide the answer. 

Biological inferences. No direct evi- 
dence suggesting the presence of life on 
Mars has been found in the pictures. 
This is not surprising, since martian life, 
if any, would probably be microbial and 
undetectable at a resolution of 300 
meters. Although inconclusive on the 
question of martian life, the photographs 
are informative on at least three sub- 
jects of biological interest: the general 
nature of the martian maria, the present 
availability of water, and the availabil- 
ity of water in the past. 

One of the most surprising results 
so far of the TV experiment is that 
nothing in the pictures suggests that 
the dark areas, the sites of the sea- 
sonal darkening wave, are more favor- 
able for life than other parts of the 
planet. On the contrary, it would now 
appear that the large-scale surface 
processes implied by the chaotic and 
featureless terrains may be of greater 
biological interest than the wave of 
darkening. We reiterate that these are 
preliminary conclusions: it may be that 
subtle physiographic differences be- 
tween dark and bright regions will 
become evident when photometrically 



110 



corrected pictures are examined. 

With regard to the availability of 
water, the pictures so far have not re- 
vealed any evidence of geothermal areas. 
We would expect such areas to be per- 
manently covered with clouds and frost, 
and these ought to be visible on the 
morning terminator: no such areas have 
been seen. A classically described 
feature of the polar cap which has been 
interpreted as wet ground — the dark 
collar — has likewise not been found. 
Other locales which have been consid- 
ered to be sites of higher-than-average 
moisture content are those which show 
diurnal brightening. A number of such 
places have been observed in the pic- 
tures, but on close inspection the bright- 
ening appears not to be readily inter- 
pretable in terms of water frosts or 
clouds. Pending their definite identifi- 
cation, however, the brightenings 
should be considered possible indica- 
tions of water. 

The results thus reinforce the conclu- 
sion, drawn from Mariner 4 and ground- 
based observations, that scarcity of 
water is the most serious limiting factor 
for life on Mars. No terrestrial species 
known to us could live in the dry mar- 
tian environment. If there is a perma- 
frost layer near the surface, or if the 
small amount of atmospheric water 
vapor condenses as frost in favorable 
sites, it is conceivable that, by evolu- 
tionary adaptation, life as we know it 
could use this water and survive on the 
planet. In any case, the continued 
search for regions of water condensa- 
tion on Mars will be an important task 
for the 1971 orbiter. 

The past history of water on Mars is 
a matter of much biological interest. 
According to current views, the chemi- 
cal reactions which led to the origin of 
life on the earth were initiated in the 
reducing atmosphere of the primitive 
earth. These reactions produced simple 
organic compounds which were precipi- 
tated into the ocean, where they under- 
went further reactions that eventually 
yielded living matter. The pictorial evi- 
dence raises the question of whether 



Mariners 6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary Analysis 

Mars ever had enough water to sustain 
an origin of life. If the proportion of 
water outgassed relative to C0 2 is the 
same for Mars as for the earth, then, 
from the mass of CO L &gt; now in the mar- 
tian atmosphere, it can be estimated that 
Mars has produced sufficient water to 
cover the planet to a depth of a few 
meters. The question is whether any- 
thing approaching this quantity of water 
was ever present on Mars in the liquid 
state. 

The existence of cratered terrains 
and the absence of Earth-like tectonic 
forms on Mars clearly implies that the 
planet has not had oceans of terrestrial 
magnitude for a very long time, pos- 
sibly never. However, we have only 
very rough ideas of how much ocean is 
required for an origin of life, and of 
how long such an ocean must last. An 
upper limit on the required time, based 
on terrestrial experience, can be derived 
from the age of the oldest fossils, &gt;3.2 
x 10° years (24). Since these fossils are 
the remains of what were apparently 
highly evolved microorganisms, the ori- 
gin of life must have taken place at a 
much earlier time, probably during the 
first few hundred million years of the 
earth&#39;s history. While one cannot rule 
out, on the basis of the TV data, the 
possibility that a comparably brief, 
aqueous epoch occurred during the 
early history of the planet, it must be 
said that the effect of the TV results 
so far is to diminish the a priori likeli- 
hood of finding life on Mars. However, 
it should be noted that if Mars is to be 
a testing ground for our notions about 
the origin of life, we must avoid using 
these same notions to disprove in ad- 
vance the possibility of life on that 
planet. 



Potentialities of the Data 

Careful computer restoration ot the 
pictures, starting with data recovered 
from six sequential playbacks of the 
near-encounter analog tapes, will be 
carried out over the next several months. 
This further processing will greatly en- 



111 



hance the completeness, appearance, 
and quantitative usefulness of the pic- 
tures. While it is not yet certain whether 
the desired 8-bit relative photometric 
accuracy can be attained, there are 
reasonable grounds for thinking that 
much new information bearing on the 
physiography, meteorology, geography, 
and other aspects of Mars will ultimately 
be obtained from the pictures. Some of 
the planned uses of the processed data 
are as follows. 

Stereoscopy. Most of the NE wide- 
angle pictures contain regions of two- 
picture overlap, and a few contain 
regions of three-picture overlap. These 
areas can be viewed in stereoscopic vi- 
sion in the conventional manner of aer- 
ial photography. Preliminary tests on 
pictures of the south polar cap (frames 
7N17 and 7N19) indicate that measure- 
ment of crater depth, central-peak 
height, and crater-rim height is possible. 
However, accuracy can be estimated 
for the elevation determinations at this 
time. 

Planetary radii. Geometric correction 
of the FE photographs should make it 
possible to determine the radius of 
Mars as a function of latitude, and 
possibly of longitude. The geometric 
figure of Mars has been historically 
troublesome because of inconsistencies 
between the optical and the dynamical 
oblateness, a discrepancy amounting to 
some 18 kilometers in the value for the 
difference of the equatorial and polar 
radii. It is possible that the darkening 
of the polar limb observed by Mariners 
6 and 7, if it is a persistent phenomenon, 
might have systematically affected the 
earlier telescopic measurements of the 
polar diameter more than irradiation 
has, giving too large a value for the 
optical flattening. However, this cannot 
explain the large flattening obtained 
from surface-feature geodesy (25). Al- 
though a fairly reliable figure for the 
polar flattening may be obtained from 
the Mariner data, it is unlikely that the 
actual radii will be determined with an 
accuracy greater than several kilometers 
because of the relatively low picture- 



element resolution in these frames and 
the difficulty in locating the limb. 

Cartography. The large number of 
craters found on the surface of Mars 
makes it feasible to establish a control 
net which uses topographic features as 
control points, instead of surface mark- 
ings based on albedo differences. This 
net should provide the basic locations 
for compiling a new series of Mars 
charts. The NE pictures, which cover 
10 to 20 percent of the area of the 
planet, will constitute the basic material 
for detailed maps of these areas. 

Satellites. We hope to detect the 
larger of Mars&#39;s satellites, Phobos, in 
two of the Mariner 6 FE pictures taken 
when Phobos was just beyond the limb 
of the planet. The satellite should have 
moved between the two frames by about 
ten picture elements, and should appear 
as a "defect" that has moved by this 
amount between the two pictures. If 
Phobos itself is not visible, its shadow 
(again detectable by its motion) should 
be. The shadow will be some five pic- 
ture elements across and will have a 
photometric depth of about 10 percent. 
If the photometric depth of the shadow 
can be measured accurately, we can de- 
termine the projected area (and hence 
the diameter) of the satellite. A similar 
method has been used to measure the 
diameter of Mercury during solar tran- 
sits. 

Photometric studies. We expect to 
derive the photometric function for each 
color, combining data from the two 
spacecraft. Observations by the current 
Mariners were made near 25°, 35°. 45°, 
and 80° phase. Since data obtained 
from the earth can be used to establish 
the absolute calibration at the smaller 
phase angles, we will also be able to 
relate the 80°-phase data to Earth-based 
observations, thus doubling the range 
over which the phase function is deter- 
mined. This information should then 
make possible the determination of 
crater slopes. Agreement for areas of 
overlap between different filters and 
between A-camera and B-camera frames 
can be used to check the validity of the

results and possibly to measure and 
correct for atmospheric scattering. 

The reciprocity principle may be use- 
ful in testing quantitatively for diurnal 
changes in the FE pictures. Such 
changes might include dissipation of 
frost or haze near the morning ter- 
minator and formation of afternoon 
clouds near the limb. 

Overlap areas in NE pictures can be 
used to obtain approximate colors, even 
though these areas are seen at different 
phase angles in each color. In addition, 
color-difference or color-ratio pictures 
may be useful in identifying local areas 
of anomalous photometric or colori- 
metric behavior. Camera-A digital pic- 
tures obtained by Mariner 7 in late 
far-encounter will be very useful for 
making color measurements. 

Comparison of pictures with radar- 
scattering and height data. The reflec- 
tion coefficient of the martian surface 
for radar waves of decimeter wavelength 
shows marked variations at a given 
latitude as a function of longitude. Even 
though few of the areas of Mars so far 
observed by radar are visible at close 
range, some correlation of topography 
with radar reflectivity may become ap- 
parent upon careful study. Clearly, the 
Mariner pictures will become steadily 
more valuable in this connection as 
more radar results and other height 
data become available. 

Effects on Mariner &#39;71 

The distinctive new terrains revealed 
in the Mariner 6 and 7 pictures, the 
relatively small fraction (10 to 20 per- 
cent) of the surface so far viewed even 
at moderate (A-camera) resolution, and 
the tantalizing new evidence of after- 
noon-brightening phenomena all empha- 
size the importance of an exploratory, 
adaptive strategy in 1971 as opposed to 
a routine mapping of geographic fea- 
tures. The fact that each of three suc- 
cessive Mariner spacecraft has revealed 
a new and unexpected topography 
strongly suggests that more surprises 
(perhaps the most important ones) are 
still to appear. 



6 and 7 Television Pictures; Preliminary Analysis 

A primary objective should be to view 
nearly all of the visible surface at A- 
camera resolution (1-kilometer pixel 
spacing), and to inspect selected typical 
areas at higher resolution, very early in 
the 90-day orbiting period. The true ex- 
tent and character of cratered, chaotic, 
and featureless terrains, and of any new 
kinds of terrain, can thus be deter- 
mined and correlated with classical light 
and dark areas, with regional height 
data, and so on. 

A second objective should be to 
search for and examine, in both spatial 
and temporal detail, those areas which 
suggest the local presence of water, 
through the afternoon-brightening phe- 
nomena, morning frosts or fogs, or other 
behavior not now recognized. Certainly 
the known "W-cloud" areas, Nix Olym- 
pica, and other, similar areas known 
from Earth observation take on a new 
interest by virtue of the Mariner 6 and 
7 results. 

The complex structure found in the 
south polar cap calls for further exam- 
ination, particularly with respect to 
separation of its more permanent fea- 
tures from diurnally or seasonally vary- 
ing ones. The sublimation of the cap 
should be carefully followed, so as to 
detect evidence of variations in thick- 
ness of the deposit and especially evi- 
dence of the possible existence of per- 
manent deposits. Study of the north 
polar cap at close range should also be 
exceedingly interesting. 

Effects on Viking &#39;73 

If the effects of the Mariner 6 and 7 
results on Mariner &#39;71 are substantial, 
they at least do not require a change of 
instrumentation, only one of mission 
strategy. This may not be true of the 
effects on Viking &#39;73. The discovery of 
so many new, unexpected properties of 
the martian surface and atmosphere 
adds a new dimension to the problem of 
selecting the most suitable landing site 
and may make Viking even more de- 
pendent on the success of Mariner &#39;71 
than has been supposed. Furthermore, 
since so much new information is re- 



113 



vealed through the tenfold step in reso- 
lution afforded by the B-camera frames, 
a further substantial increase in resolu- 
tion, not available to Mariner &#39;71, may 
have to be incorporated in Viking in 
order to examine even more closely the 
fine-scale characteristics of various ter- 
rain types before a landing site is 
chosen. 



Summary and Conclusions 

Even in relatively unprocessed form, 
the Mariner 6 and 7 pictures provide 
fundamental new insights concerning 
the surface and atmosphere of Mars. 
Several unexpected results emphasize 
the importance of versatility in instru- 
ment design, flexibility in mission de- 
sign, and use of an adaptive strategy in 
exploring planetary surfaces at high 
resolution. 

The surface is clearly visible in all 
wavelengths used, including the blue. 
No blue-absorbing haze is found. 

Thin, patchy, aerosol-scattering lay- 
ers are present in the atmosphere at 
heights of from 15 to 40 kilometers, at 
several latitudes. 

Diurnal brightening in the "W-cloud" 
area is seen repeatedly and is associated 
with specific topographic features. No 
fully satisfactory explanation for the 
effect is found. 

Darkening of the polar cap in a band 
near the limb is clearly seen in FE pic- 
tures and is less distinctly visible in one 
or two NE frames. Localized, diffuse 
bright patches are seen in several places 
on and near the polar cap; these may be 
small, low clouds. 

Widespread cratered terrain is seen, 
especially in dark areas of the southern 
hemisphere. Details of light-dark transi- 
tions are often related to local crater 
forms. Asymmetric markings are char- 
acteristic of craters in many dark areas; 
locally, these asymmetries often appear 
related, as if defined by a prevailing 
wind direction. 



Two distinct populations of primary 
craters are present, distinguished on the 
basis of size, morphology, and age. An 
episodic surface history is indicated. 
In addition to the cratered terrain 
anticipated from Mariner 4 results, at 
least two new, distinctive topographic 
forms are seen: chaotic terrains and 
featureless terrains. The cratered terrain 
is indicative of extreme age; the two new 
terrains both seem to require the present- 
day operation of especially active modi- 
fying processes in these areas. When 
seen at closer range, the very bright, 
streaked complex found in the Tharsis- 
Candor region may reveal yet another 
distinctive topographic character. Be- 
cause of the afternoon-brightening phe- 
nomena long known here, this area pro- 
vides a fascinating prospect for further 
exploration in 1971. 

No tectonic and topographic forms 
similar to terrestrial forms are observed. 
Evidences of both atmosphere-surface 
effects and topographic effects are seen 
on the south polar cap. At the cap edge, 
where the "snow" is thinnest, strong 
control by solar heating, as affected by 
local slopes, is indicated. Crater visibil- 
ity is greatly enhanced in this area. 

On the cap itself, intensity variations 
suggestive of variable "snow" thickness 
are seen. These may be caused by wind- 
drifting of the snow or by differential 
exchange of solid and vapor, or by both. 
Snow thicknesses here of several 
grams or several tens of grams per 
square centimeter are inferred if the 
snow material is K.O or CO., respec- 
tively. The possibility that the material 
is H l .O seems strongly ruled out on 
several grounds. 

Variable atmospheric, and atmo- 
sphere-surface, effects are seen at high 
northern latitudes; these effects include 
the polar "hood" and bright, diurnally 
variable circumpolar patches. 

Several classical features have been 
successfully identified with specific topo- 
graphic forms, mostly craters or crater 
remnants.

The findings are inconclusive on the 
question of life on Mars, but they are 
relevant in several ways. They support 
earlier evidence that scarcity of water, 
past and present, is a serious limiting 



factor for life on the planet. Nothing so 
far seen in the pictures suggests that 
the dark regions are more favorable for 
life than other parts of Mars.
