# Section I 

## LEX I. 

<blockquote>
    Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus illud a viribus impressis cogitur statum suum mutare. 
</blockquote>

<span class="textsc">Projectilia</span> perseverant in motibus suis, nisi quatenus a resistentia aeris retardantur, &amp; vi gravitatis impelluntur deorsum. 
Trochus, cujus partes cohaerendo perpetuo retrahunt sese a motibus rectilineis, non cessat rotari, nisi quatenus ab aere retardatur.
Majora autem planetarum &amp; cometarum corpora motus suos &amp; progressivos &amp; circulares in spatiis minus resistentibus factos conservant diutius. 


## LEX II. 

<blockquote>
Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impresses, &amp; fieri secundum lineam rectam qua vis ilia imprimitur. 
</blockquote>

Si vis aliqua motum quemvis generet; dupla duplum, tripla triplum generabit, sive simul &amp; semel, sive gradatim &amp; successive impressa fuerit. 
Et hie motus (quoniam in eandem semper plagam cum vi generatrice determinatur) si corpus antea movebatur, motui ejus vel conspiranti additur, vel contrario subducitur, vel obliquo oblique adjicitur, &amp; cum eo secundum utriusque determinationem componitur. 

## LEX III. 

<blockquote>
Actioni contrariam semper &amp; cequalem esse reactioimn: sive coiporum duorum actiones in se mutuo semper esse cequales &amp; in partes contrarias dirigi. 
</blockquote>

Quicquid premit vel trahit alterum, tantundem ab eo premitur vel trahitur. 
Si quis lapidem digito premit, premitur &amp; hujus digitus a lapide. 
Si equus lapidem funi alligatum trahit, retrahetur etiam &amp; equus (ut ita dicam) sequaliter in lapidem: nam funis utrinque distentus eodem relaxandi se conatu urgebit equum versus lapidem, ac lapidem versus equum; tantumque impediet progressum unius quantum promovet progressum alterius. 
Si corpus aliquod in corpus aliud impingens, motum ejus vi sua quomodocunque mutaverit, idem quoque vicissim in motu proprio eandem mutationem in partem contrariam vi alterius (ob aequalitatem pressionis mutuae) subibit. 
His actionibus aequales hunt mutationes, non velocitatum, sed motuum; scilicet in corporibus non aliunde impeditis.
Mutationes enim velocitatum, in contrarias itidem partes factae, quia motus aequaliter mutantur, sunt corporibus reciproce proportionales. 
Obtinet etiam hsec lex in attractionibus, ut in scholio proximo probabitur. 

## COROLLARIUM I. 

<blockquote>
Corpus viribtis conjunctis diagonalem parallelogrammi eodem tempore describere, quo latera separatis. 
</blockquote>

Si corpus dato tempore, vi sola <span class="math">M</span> in loco <span class="math">A</span> impressa, ferretur uniformi cum motu ab <span class="math">A</span> ad <span class="math">B</span>; &amp; vi sola <span class="math">N</span> in eodem loco impressa, ferretur ab <span class="math">A</span> ad <span class="math">C</span>: 
    compleatur parallelogrammum <span class="math">ABDC</span>, &amp; vi utraque feretur corpus illud eodem tempore in diagonali ab <span class="math">A</span> ad <span class="math">D</span>. 
Nam quoniam vis <span class="math">N</span>agit secundum lineam <span class="math">AC</span> ipsi <span class="math">BD</span> parallelam, haec vis per legem 11 nihil mutabit velocitatem accedendi ad lineam illam <span class="math">BD</span> a vi altera genitam. 
Accedet igitur corpus eodem tempore ad lineam <span class="math">BD</span>, sive vis <span class="math">N</span> imprimatur, sive non; atque ideo in fine illius temporis reperietur alicubi in linea ilia <span class="math">BD</span>. 
Eodem argumento in fine temporis ejusdem reperietur alicubi in linea <span class="math">CD</span>, &amp; idcirco in utriusque linear concursu <span class="math">D</span>reperiri necesse est. 
Perget autem motu rectilineo ab <span class="math">A</span> ad <span class="math">D</span>per legem I.

# Axioms, or Laws of Motion

## LAW I 

<blockquote>
Every body continues in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it. 
</blockquote>


<span class="textsc">Projectiles</span> continue in their motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air, or impelled downwards by the force of gravity. 
A top, whose parts by their cohesion are continually drawn aside from rectilinear motions, does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the air. 
The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in freer spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time. 

## LAW II

<blockquote>
The change of motion is proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed. 
</blockquote>

If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. 
And this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating force), if the body moved before, is added to or subtracted from the former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both. 

## LAW III 

<blockquote>
To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or, the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts. 
</blockquote>

Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that other. 
If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed by the stone. 
If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone; for the distended rope, by the same endeavor to relax or unbend itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone as it does the stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as much as it advances that of the other. 
If a body impinge upon another, and by its force change the motion of the other, that body also (because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal change, in its own motion, towards the contrary part. 
The changes made by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions of bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any other impediments. 
For, because the motions are equally changed, the changes of the velocities made towards contrary parts are inversely proportional to the bodies. 
This law takes place also in attractions, as will be proved in the next Scholium. 


### COROLLARY I 

<blockquote>
A body, acted on by two forces simultaneously, will describe the diagonal of a parallelogram in the same time as it would describe the sides by those forces separately. 
</blockquote>

If a body in a given time, by the force <span class="math">M</span>impressed apart in the place <span class="math">A</span>, should with an uniform motion be carried from <span class="math">A</span>to <span class="math">B</span>, and by the force <span class="math">N</span>impressed apart in the same place, should be carried from <span class="math">A</span>to <span class="math">C</span>, let the parallelogram <span class="math">ABCD</span>be completed, and, by both forces acting together, it will in the same time be carried in the diagonal from <span class="math">A</span>to <span class="math">D</span>. 
For since the force <span class="math">N</span>acts in the direction ofthe line <span class="math">AC</span>, parallel to <span class="math">BD</span>, this force (by the second Law) will not at all alter the velocity generated by the other force <span class="math">M</span>, by which the body is carried towards the line <span class="math">BD</span>. 
The body therefore will arrive at the line <span class="math">BD</span>in the same time, whether the force <span class="math">N</span>be impressed or not; and therefore at the end of that time it will be found somewhere in the line <span class="math">BD</span>. 
By the same argument, at the end of the same time it will be found somewhere in the line <span class="math">CD</span>. 
Therefore it will be found in the point <span class="math">D</span>, where both lines meet. 
But it will move in a right line from <span class="math">A</span> to <span class="math">D</span>, by Law I. 

# Section II 

The determination of centripetal forces. 

## PROPOSITION I. THEOREM I 

<blockquote>
The areas which revolving bodies describe by radii drawn to an immovable centre of force do lie in the same immovable planes, and are proportional to the times in which they are described. 
</blockquote>

For suppose the time to be divided into equal parts, and in the first part of that time let the body by its innate force describe the right line <span class="math">AB</span>. 
In the second part of that time, the same would (by Law I), if not hindered, proceed directly to <span class="math">c</span>, along the line <span class="math">Bc</span> equal to <span class="math">AB</span>; so that by the radii <span class="math">AS</span>, <span class="math">BS</span>, <span class="math">cS</span>, drawn to the centre, the equal areas <span class="math">ASB</span>, <span class="math">BSr</span>, would be described. 
But when the body is arrived at </span class="math">B</span>, suppose that a centripetal force acts at once with a great impulse, and, turning aside the body from the right line <span class="math">Bc</span>, compels it afterwards to continue its motion along the right line <span class="math">BC</span>. 

Draw <span class="math">cC</span> parallel to <span class="math">BS</span>, meeting <span class="math">BC</span>in <span class="math">C</span>; and at the end of the second part of the time, the body (by Cor. i of the Laws) will be found in <span class="math">C</span>, in the same plane with the triangle ASB.
Join <span class="math">SC</span>, and, because <span class="math">SB</span>and <span class="math">O</span>are parallel, the triangle <span class="math">SBC</span>will be equal to the triangle SBc, and therefore 
also to the triangle SAB. By the like argument, if the centripetal force acts 
successively in <span class="math">C</span>,<span class="math">D</span>,<span class="math">E</span>, &amp;<span class="math">c</span>, and makes the body, in each single particle of time, to describe the right lines <span class="math">CD</span>,<span class="math">DE</span>,<span class="math">EF</span>, &amp; <span class="math">c</span>, they will all lie in the same plane; and the triangle <span class="math">SCD</span>will be equal to the triangle <span class="math">SBC</span>, and <span
    class="math">SDE</span> to <span class="math">SCD</span>, and <span class="math">SEF</span> to <span class="math">SDE</span>.
And therefore, in equal times, equal areas are described in one immovable plane: and, by composition, any sums <span class="math">SADS</span>, <span class="math">SAFS</span>, of those areas, are to each other as the times in which they are described. 
Now let the number of those triangles be augmented, and their breadth diminished in infinitum; and (by Cor. iv, Lem. in) their ultimate perimeter <span class="math">ADF</span>will be a curved line: and therefore the centripetal force, by which the body is continually drawn back from the tangent of this curve, will act continually; and any described areas <span class="math">SADS</span>,<span class="math">SAFS</span>, which are always proportional to the times of description, will, in this case also, be proportional to those times.
