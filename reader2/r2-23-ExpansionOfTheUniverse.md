title: Expansion of the Universe
author: Hermann Bondi
exerpt: Bondi, a noted theoretical physicist and astronomer, presents the evidence for the over-all expansion of the universe, evidence which depends greatly on the observed red shift of light from distant galaxies.
    The number mentioned at the end of the paper, ten billion years, is sometimes picturesquely called the &ldquo;age of the universe.&rdquo;
intro: An excerpt from his book <em>Relativity and Common Sense: A New Approach to Einstein</em>, 1962.

The most striking feature of the universe is probably its expansion.
What exactly is the evidence for this and how strong is it?
In Plate I we have a picture that displays some of the evidence in striking form.
A series of pictures of galaxies is shown in the left-hand column.
They are all taken with the same telescope, using the same magnification.
On the right-hand side we see the spectra of these galaxies.
Now, first, what is a spectrum? 
It is well known that white light is a combination of all the colors and that it can be broken up into these colors by suitable aids; a rainbow is a familiar instance.
A handier means is the use of a prism of glass or other suitable material; with its aid the whole band of colors of sunlight is spread out.
If one uses a prism that spreads out the sunlight very clearly, then one notices that the colors do not form a smooth band and that in numerous places dark lines run across the spectrum.
The origin of these lines is rather complicated.
In the main they are due to the light from the sun shining through cooler gases of the sun&#39;s atmosphere, and these gases happen to be opaque to very particular colors, to thin lines, and so leave a part of the spectrum dark.
The astronomer can use spectroscopes of great power to analyze the light of individual stars and also of individual galaxies.
Naturally, particularly for the very distant galaxies, rather little light is available, and because of that, and for more technical reasons, the spectrum of a galaxy will not be nearly as clear as, say, the spectrum of the sun.
Nevertheless, a few of the very prominent dark lines do show up, even in the spectra of these distant galaxies.
The remarkable phenomenon that was discovered nearly forty years ago is that these lines are not where they ought to be, not where they are in the case of the sun, say, but they are displaced; they are shifted.
The shift is always toward the red and is indicated in the illustrations of the spectra in Plate I.
You will notice that the fainter and smaller the galaxy looks, the greater the shift of the spectrum toward the red. This is a full description of the direct observational result.
A red shift of the spectrum is observed and is correlated with the apparent brightness of the galaxy, so that the fainter the galaxy, the greater the red shift.
From here on we start on a series of interpretations.


## The Red Shift

First, what can be the explanation of such a red shift?
In what other circumstances are red shifts observed?
The answer is that, but for one rather insignificant cause, the red shift always indicates a velocity of recession.
Unfamiliar as the phenomenon is in the case of light, it is commonly noticed in the case of sound. 
If a whistling railway train speeds past you, then you notice that, to your ears, the pitch of the whistle drops markedly as the train passes you. 
The reason for this is not difficult to understand. 
The whistle produces sound; sound is a vibration of the air in which pressure maxima and pressure minima succeed each other periodically; these travel toward your ears where they are turned into nerve impulses that enter your consciousness. 
While the train is approaching, each successive pressure maximum has a smaller distance to travel to reach you. 
Therefore, the time interval between the reception of the pressure maxima will be less than the time interval between their emission. 
We say that the pitch of the note is raised.
Conversely, when the train is receding from you, each successive pressure maximum has farther to travel and, therefore, the pressure maxima will reach your ear at intervals of time greater than the intervals at which they were emitted. 
Accordingly, the pitch is lower. 
How great the raising or the lowering of the pitch is, depends on the ratio of the velocity of the train to the velocity of sound, which is about 1100 ft. per second.

plate I. The expansion of the universe is inferred from these and similar observations. 
The left-hand column shows galaxies at various distances photographed with the same magnification. 
In each photograph the galaxy appears as a diffuse object with its center in the middle of the picture, but the two most distant ones are marked by arrows for purposes of identification. 
The other diffuse objects in the photographs are other galaxies, the sharp ones being stars near to us. 
On the right are photographs of the diffuse-looking spectra of the galaxies stretching in each case from blue on the left to red on the right. 
The bright lines above and below each spectrum are produced in the laboratory and serve only as markers. 
The pair of dark lines in the spectrum of each galaxy above the tip of the arrow would be above the foot of the arrow if the source were at rest.

Very much the same thing happens with light, but here an increase in the pitch becomes noticed as a shift toward the violet; a decrease in the pitch becomes noticed as a shift toward the red. 
Also, the crucial velocity is now not that of sound, but the very much higher velocity of light at 186,000 miles per second. 
A red shift, therefore, indicates a velocity of recession of the source; a velocity standing to the velocity of light in the ratio given by the magnitude of the red shift&mdash;that is, by the change in wave length divided by the wave length. 
The velocities so derived from the observed red shifts are shown on the right-hand side of Plate I. 
Such a velocity of recession is, then, the only cause of the red shift that we can infer from our terrestrial knowledge of physics.  
What about the other characteristic of the picture, this time the characteristic of the photographs on the left, the increasing faintness and diminishing size? 
We all know that an object of a given brightness will look fainter the farther away it is. 
There is very little else in astronomy to guide us about the distances of these galaxies which we see so very far away. 
Accordingly, if we interpret the faintness of the galaxies as indicators of their distances, and the red shift of the spectra as velocities of recession, then we find that the velocity of recession is proportional to the distance of the object 


## Velocity of Receding Stars

We have inferred a &ldquo;velocity-distance law&rdquo; from the red shift-brightness relation. 
For a long time physicists and astronomers felt rather uneasy about these enormous velocities of recession that seemed to follow from their observations. 
They argued that all our interpretation was based on our local knowledge of physics, and that unknown effects might well occur in the depth of the universe that somehow falsify the picture that we receive. 
Nowadays, we have little patience with this type of argument. 
For the expansion of the universe is not merely given by the observation of the spectrum.  
We have also noted the remarkable uniformity of the universe, how it looks the same in all directions around us if only we look sufficiently far. 
If, then, we suppose that the universe is, indeed, uniform on a very large scale, we can ask the mathematical question: How can it move and yet maintain its uniformity? 
The answer is that it can only move in such a way that the velocity of every object is in the line of sight and proportional to its distance. 
This is the only type of motion that will maintain uniformity. 
Therefore, we are again driven to the conclusion that an expansion with a velocity of recession proportional to distance is a natural consequence of the assumption of uniformity which is also based on observation.  
Furthermore, if we try to form a theory of the universe, whichever way we do it, we always come up with the answer that it is almost bound to be in motion, with objects showing velocities proportional to their distances. 


I must again stress the uniformity of the system. 
We are not in a privileged position on the basis of these assumptions, but in a typical one. 
The universe would present the same appearance to observers on any other galaxy. 
They would see the same effects; the same red shift-brightness relation. 
Though no one can be certain of anything in this field, we do see that there are different fines of argument all converging to the conclusion that the red shifts should indeed be taken as indicating velocities of recession proportional to the distance of the objects. 
If we divide the distance of any galaxy by its velocity of recession, we get the same number whatever galaxy we choose. 
That follows from the proportionality of velocity and distance. 
This number is a time, a time that, according to the most recent work, is about 10,000 million years. 
In some way or other this is the characteristic time of the universe.
