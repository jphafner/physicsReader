# physicsReader

This is my repository for the [Project Physics Reader](https://archive.org/details/projectphysicscollection).
My intentions are to convert them into an easily accessibile format.
I am using [Ebooks @ Adelaide](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/) as inspiration,
  and [gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO) for formatting.
