intro: An article from <em>The American Journal of Physics</em>, 1944.
—</p>

<p>The physics teacher has been accustomed to find in athletic activities excellent problems involving velocities, accelerations, projectiles and impacts.
He has at the same time overlooked a rich source of illustrations of fictitious precision and bad metrology.
When the student is told that the height of a tree should not be expressed as 144.632 ft if the length of its shadow has been measured only to the nearest foot, the student may see the point at once and yet ask, “What difference does it make?”.
But when shown that common procedures in measuring the achievements of a discus thrower could easily award a world's record to the wrong man, the student agrees that good technic in measurement is something more than an academic ideal.
The present discussion <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> has been prepared partly to give the physics teacher something to talk about, but also to start a chain of publicity which may ultimately make athletic administrators better physicists and so make their awards more just.</p>

<p>If physicists were given charge of the measurements of sport, one may feel sure that they would frown upon the practice of announcing the speed of a racing automobile in six or seven digits—see, for example, the <em>World Almanac</em> for any year—when neither the length of the course nor the elapsed time is known one-tenth so precisely.
They could and would point out such inconsistencies as that observed in some of the events of the 1932 Olympic games when races were electrically and photographically timed to 0.01 sec, but with the starting gun fired from such a position that its report could not reach the ears of the waiting runners until perhaps 0.03 to 0.04 sec. after the official start of the race.
In this case, electric timing was used only as an unofficial or semi-official supplement to 0.1 sec hand timing;
    but it is easy to see that a systematic error of a few hundredths of a second will frequently cause stopwatch timers to catch the wrong tenth.</p>

<p>Scientific counsel on the field would immediately advise judges of the high jump and pole vault to measure heights from the point of take-off instead of from an irrelevant point directly below the bar which should be at the same level but sometimes isn't.
Physicists would suggest equipping field judges with surveying instruments for determining after each throw, not only how far the weight traveled but also the relative elevation of the landing point and the throwing circle. Certainly it is meaningless if not deceptive to record weight throws to a small fraction of an inch when surface irregularities may be falsifying by inches the true merit of the performance.</p>

<p>In shot-putting, for example, a measured length will be in error by practically the same amount as the discrepancy between initial and final elevations, since the flight of the shot at its terminus is inclined at about 45° to the horizontal.
For the discus the effect is some three times as serious because of the flatter trajectory employed with this missile, while broad jumpers under usual conditions must be prepared to give or take as much as 0.5 ft, according to the luck of the pit.
Meanwhile, the achievements in these events go down in the books with the last eighth or even the last sixteenth of an inch recorded.</p>

<p>At the 1932 Olympic Games an effective device was used to grade the broad-jumping pit to the level of the take-off board before each leap, but the practice has not become general.
Athletic regulations, indeed, recognize the desirability of proper leveling in nearly all the field events, but in actual usage not enough is done about it.
Since sprinters are not credited with records achieved when blown along before the wind, there is no obvious reason why weight hurlers should be permitted to throw things down hill.</p>

<p>The rule books make no specification as to the hardness of the surface upon which weights shall be thrown, but this property has a significant effect upon the measured ranges of the shot and hammer, since it is prescribed that measurement shall be made to the near side of the impression produced by the landing weight.
In a soft surface this impression may be enlarged in the backward direction enough to diminish the throw by several times the ostensible precision of the measurement.</p>

<p>A physicist would never check the identity of three or four iron balls as to mass by the aid of grocers' scales or the equivalent and then pretend that there was any significance in the fact that one of them was thrown a quarter of an inch farther than the others.
In measuring the length of a javelin throw, no physicist who wanted to be right to ⅛<!--vulgar 1/8--> inch would be content to establish his perpendicular from the point of fall to the scratchline by a process of guesswork, but this is the way it is always done by field judges, even in the best competition.</p>

<p>Among the numerous errors afflicting measurements in the field sports, there is none which is more systematically committed, or which could be more easily rectified, than that pertaining to the variation of the force of gravity.
The range of a projectile dispatched at any particular angle of elevation and with a given initial speed is a simple function of <span class="math">g</span>.
Only in case the end of the trajectory is at the same level as its beginning does this function become an inverse proportionality;
    but in any case the relationship is readily expressed, and no physicist will doubt that a given heave of the shot will yield a longer put in equatorial latitudes than it would in zones where the gravitational force is stronger.
Before saying that the 55 ft. put achieved by <span class="math">A</span> in Mexico City is a better performance than one of <span class="math">54</span> ft, <span class="math">11</span> in.
    which <span class="math">B</span> accomplished in Boston, we should surely inquire about the values of <span class="math">g</span> which the respective athletes were up against, but it is never done.
    As a matter of record, the value of <span class="math">g</span> in Boston exceeds that in Mexico City by ¼<!-- vulgar 1/4-->} percent, so the shorter put was really the better.
To ignore the handicap of a larger value of <span class="math">g</span> is like measuring the throw with a stretched tape.
The latter practice would never be countenanced under AAU or Olympic regulations, but the former is standard procedure.</p>

<p>Rendering justice to an athlete who has had to compete against a high value of <span class="math">g</span> Involves questions that are not simple.
It will be agreed that he is entitled to some compensation and that in comparing two throws made under conditions similar except as to <span class="math">g</span>, the proper procedure would be to compare not the actual ranges achieved, but the ranges which would have been achieved had some “standard” value of <span class="math">g</span>—say 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup>—prevailed in both cases.
The calculation of exactly what would have happened is probably impossible to physics.
Although it is a simple matter to discuss the behavior of the implement after it leaves the thrower's hand and to state how this behavior depends upon <span class="math">g</span>, the dependence of the initial velocity of projection upon <span class="math">g</span> depends upon the thrower's form and upon characteristics of body mechanics to which but little attention has so far been devoted.</p>

<p>The work done by the thrower bestows upon the projectile both potential and kinetic energy.
In a strong gravitational field, the imparted potential energy is large and one must therefore suppose the kinetic energy to be reduced, since the thrower's propelling energy must be distributed to both.
We have no proof, however, that the total useful work is constant despite variation of <span class="math">g</span>, nor do we know the manner of its inconstancy, if any.
The muscular catapult is not a spring, subject to Hooke's law, but a far more complicated system with many unknown characteristics.
The maximum external work which one may do in a single energetic shove by arms, legs or both obviously depends partly upon the resisting force encountered.
Only a little outside work can be done in putting a ping-pong ball because the maximum possible acceleration, limited by the masses and other characteristics of the bodily mechanism itself, is too slight to call out substantial inertial forces in so small a mass.
The resisting force encountered when a massive body is pushed in a direction that has an upward component, as in shot-putting, does of course depend upon <span class="math">g</span>;
    and until we know from experiment how external work in such an effort varies with resisting force, we shall not be able to treat the interior ballistics of the shot-putter with anything approaching rigor.</p>

<p>Several alternative assumptions may be considered.
If we suppose that the velocity of delivery, or “muzzle velocity,” <span class="math">v</span>, of the missile is unaffected by variations of <span class="math">g</span>, we have only the external effect to deal with.
Adopting the approximate range formula <span class="math">R = v<sup>2</sup>/g</span> (which neglects the fact that the two ends of the trajectory are at different levels and which assumes the optimum angle of elevation) we find that the increment of range <span class="math">dR</span> resulting from an increment <span class="math">dg</span> is simply <span class="math">−Rdg/g</span>.
On the more plausible assumption that the total work done on the projectile is independent of <span class="math">g</span>, this total to include both the potential and kinetic energies imparted, one obtains as a correction formula,</p>

<p>\begin{equation}
dR = - \left(1 + \frac{2h}{R}\right) R \frac{dg}{g}
\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}</p>

<p>where <span class="math">h</span> is the. vertical lift which the projectile gets while in the hand of the thrower.
A third assumption, perhaps the most credible of all, would hold constant and independent of <span class="math">g</span> the total work done upon the projectile and upon a portion of the mass of the thrower's person.
It is not necessary to decide how much of the thrower's mass goes into this latter term;
    it drops out and we have again Eq.~(\ref{eq:1}), provided only that the work done on the thrower's body can be taken into account by an addition to the mass of the projectile.</p>

<p>These considerations show that a variation of <span class="math">g</span> affects the range in the same sense before and after delivery, an increase in <span class="math">g</span> reducing the delivery velocity and also pulling the projectile down more forcibly after its flight begins.
They indicate also that the latter effect is the more important since, in Eq.~(\ref{eq:1}), <span class="math">t &gt; 2h/R</span> by a factor of perhaps five in the shot-put and more in the other weight-throwing events.</p>

<p>One concludes that the least which should be done to make amends to a competitor striving against a large value of <span class="math">g</span> is to give him credit for the range which his projectile would have attained, for the same initial velocity, at a location where <span class="math">g</span> is “standard.”
This is not quite justice, but it is a major step in the right direction.
The competitor who has been favored by a small value of <span class="math">g</span> should of course have his achievement treated in the same way.
The corrections so calculated will not be negligible magnitudes, as Fig.~\ref{fig:1} shows.
They are extremely small percentages of the real ranges, but definitely exceed the ostensible probable errors of measurement.
It is not customary to state probable errors explicitly in connection with athletic measurements, but when a throw is recorded as <span class="math">57</span> ft, <span class="math">1</span> in,
    one naturally concludes that the last thirty-second inch, if not completely reliable, must have been regarded as having some significance.</p>

<h2 id="rotation-of-the-earth">Rotation of the Earth</h2>

<p>It is customary to take account of the effects of terrestrial rotation when aiming long-range guns, but athletes and administrators of sport have given little or no attention to such effects in relation to their projectiles.
As a matter of fact they should, for at low latitudes the range of a discus or shot thrown in an eastward direction</p>

<p>where <span class="math">g</span> is the ordinary acceleration due to weight, <span class="math">V<sub>0</sub></span> is the initial speed of the projectile, <span class="math">a</span> is the angle of elevation of initial motion (measured upward from the horizontal in the direction of projection), <span class="math">ω</span>(rad/sec) is the angular speed of rotation of the earth, <span class="math">λ</span> is the geographic latitude of the point of departure of the projectile, and μ is the azimuth of the plane of the trajectory, measured clockwise from the north point. 
A derivation of this equation (though not the first) is given in reference 2, along with a discussion of its application to real cases.
The approximations accepted in the derivation are such as might possibly be criticized where long range guns are considered, but they introduce no measurable errors into the treatment of athletic projectiles.</p>

<p>The first term of the right-hand member of Eq.~(\ref{eq:2}) is the ordinary elementary range expression, and naturally it expresses almost the whole of the actual range.
The second term is a small correction which is of positive sign for eastbound projectiles (<span class="math">0 &gt; μ &gt; 180°</span>) and negative for westbound.
The correction term, being proportional to <span class="math">V<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup></span>, increases with <span class="math">V<sub>0</sub></span> at a greater rate than does the range as a whole.
Hence the percentage increase or decrease of range, because of earth rotation, varies in proportion to <span class="math">V<sub>0</sub></span> or to the square root of the range itself.
Evidently this effect is a maximum at the equator and zero at the poles.
Inspection of the role of a shows that the correction term is a maximum for a 30° angle of elevation and that it vanishes when the angle of elevation is 60°.</p>

<p>By the appropriate numerical substitiTtions in Eq.~(\ref{eq:2}),
    one may show that a well-thrown discus in tropic latitudes will go an inch farther eastward than westward.
This is many times the apparent precision of measurement for this event,
    and records have changed hands on slimmer margins.
Significant effects of the same kind, though of lesser magnitude, appear in the cases of the javelin, hammer, shot and even the broad jump, where the east-west differential exceeds the commonly recorded sixteenth of an inch.</p>

<p>Figures \ref{fig:1} and \ref{fig:2} are types of correction charts that might be used to normalize the performances of weight throwers to a uniform value of <span class="math">g</span> and a common direction of projection.
Figure~\ref{fig:1} has been prepared with the shot-put in mind, but is not restricted to implements of any particular mass.
The inclined straight lines of this figure are graphs of <span class="math">−dR</span> versus <span class="math">dg</span> from Eq.~(\ref{eq:1}).
Values of the parameter <span class="math">R</span> are indicated on the graphs.
The uniform value 100 cm has been adopted for <span class="math">h</span>, an arbitrary procedure but a harmless one in view of the insensitivity of <span class="math">dR</span> to <span class="math">h</span>.</p>

<p>Figure~\ref{fig:2}, particularly applicable to the hammer throw, furnishes means for equalizing the effect of earth spin upon athletes competing with the same implement but directing their throws variously as may be necessitated by the lay-out of their respective fields.
An angle of elevation of 45° has been assumed in the construction of these curves, a somewhat restrictive procedure which finds justification in the fact that no hammer thrown at an angle significantly different from 45° is likely to achieve a range worth correcting.
These curves are plotted from Eq.~(\ref{eq:2});
    their application to particular cases is described in the figure legend.</p>

<p>Upon noticing that some of these corrections are quite small fractions of an inch, the reader may ask whether the trouble is worth while.
This is a question that is in great need of clarification and one that may not be answered with positiveness until the concept of the probable error of a measurement shall have become established among the metrologists of sport.
Physicists will agree that to every measurement worth conserving for the attention of Record Committees should be attached a statement of its probable error;
    without such a statement there will always be the danger of proclaiming a new record on the basis of a new performance that is apparently, though not really, better than the old.
If the corrections of Fig.~\ref{fig:2} exceed the probable error to be claimed for a measurement, then those corrections must be applied.</p>

<p>The aim of the American Athletic Union in these matters is hard to determine.
Watches must be “examined,” “regulated” and “tested” by a reputable jeweler or watchmaker, but one finds no definition of what constitutes an acceptable job of regulation.
Distances must be measured with “a steel tape.”

    Curves for rendering throws in various directions comparable.
    The assumed latitude is 30&deg;, either north or south,
        and the assumed angle of elevation is 45&deg;.
    Since the range has a maximum for about this angle of elevation,
        the curves also apply well to angles several degrees on either side.
    The curves show, for example (circled point),
        that a missile thrown 200 ft in a direction 30&deg; south of east
        should have 5/16 inch subtracted from its range in order to
        bring it into fair comparison with unadjusted northward or southward
        throws or with throws in any other direction which have been adjusted
        by reference to curves of this type appropriately constructed for their
        respective latitudes.

<p>Implements must find the weights of the implements “correct.”
Such ideals of perfection are not realistic, and the only alternative is to recognize the existence of error and state its magnitude.
The minimum permissible weight for each im- plement is prescribed both in pounds and in kilograms by AAU rules, but in no instance are the prescriptions exactly equivalent.
A discus thrower whose implement just satisfies the metric specification will use a discus 4 gram, or ½<!-- vulgar 1/2--> percent, lighter than that of a competitor whose discus just passes as judged by an inspector using perfect scales calibrated in British units.
Those 4 grams will give the former athlete two or three extra inches of distance, an advantage that might be decisive.</p>

<p>Similar comments could be made about the rules of competition of the ICAAAA, where one reads that the javelin throw is measured from the point at which the point of the javelin first strikes the ground.
This is a mark that cannot in general be determined to the often implied ⅛<!-- vulgar 1/8--> inch since it is obliterated by the subsequent penetration of the implement.
Any javelin throw as correctly measured by ICAAAA rules will show a greater distance than if measured by AAU rules, but few field judges know this nor could they do much about it if they did.
It is probable that the rules do not say what was meant in these cases.
It is interesting that whereas the hammer, shot and discus must be thrown upon a level surface, there is no such requirement in the case of the javelin.</p>

<p>Any serious attempt to put the measurements of sport upon a scientific basis would be met with vast inertia if not positive hostility.
The training of athletes is still very largely an art, and there is no reason to suppose that those who are at present practicing this art with success will be predisposed to changes involving ways of thought which, however commonplace in other disciplines, are novel in athletic competition.
One eminent track and field coach, a producer of national, Olympic and world champions, told the writer that he had no interest in hairsplitting;
    that leveling the ground accurately would be too much trouble;
    that common sense is better than a wind gage for estimating the effect of wind conditions on sprinters; that a man can't put the shot by theory—it's all in the feeling; that the exact angle of elevation is unimportant as long as he gets it in the groove.</p>

<p>A few years ago, the writer published some criticisms along the lines of the present article and sent reprints to each of the several hundred National Committeemen of the AAU.
One acknowledgment was received, but no reactions to the subject matter.
In a sense, this indifference was only just recompense for the writer's habit of ignoring communications from nonphysicists proposing novel theories of the atom, or otherwise instructing the physicist as to the foundations of his science.</p>

<p>There probably exists a general feeling that part of the charm of sport resides in accident and uncertainty.
Any discussion of the possibility of replacing the balls-and-strikes umpire in baseball by a robot will bring out the opinion that the fallibilities of the umpire are part of the entertainment for which the public pays.
An optical instrument for determining from the sidelines whether or not a football has been advanced to first down was tried out in California a few years ago.
It was technically successful, but a popular failure.
The crowd was suspicious of a measurement that it did not understand and could not watch;
    the players begrudged the elimination of the breather which a chain measurement affords;
    and even the linemen protested the loss of their dramatic moment.</p>

<p>Though entertained by such attitudes, the physicist will hardly be able to dismiss a feeling that in any field of popular importance or interest, it is improper to keep up the appearances of accurate and comparable measurement without doing what might be done to gain the reality.
In the matter of athletic records, he and very few others know what to do about it. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
