---

This book began at the birth of a child, and traced its development until it enters &lsquo;the gateway to imagination and reason&rsquo;.
This is the stage when the child can manipulate objects in thought as well as with its hands: when it can make images of them.
The child has little knowledge yet, in the ordinary sense of the word; but it has the mental equipment to learn and create knowledge.
Once a child can make images, it can also reason, and build for itself a coherent picture of the world that is more than separate bundles of sense impressions.

We have just seen that when a child enters &lsquo;the gateway to imagination&rsquo;, it leaves all animals behind.
Before it learns to make images, a young human develops in much the same way as a young animal.
Children and animals alike have to learn to co-ordinate their various senses and to recognise objects.
But after that, animals fall behind.
They have no power of imagination.
That is, they cannot carry images in the mind; and without imagery, without an inner language, they cannot manipulate ideas.

The theme of imagination runs through this book.
We have examined some of the great achievements of science and seen that they are imaginative ideas.
Science does not merely plod on like a surveyor, laboriously mapping a stretch of country, square mile by square mile.
Of course nature must be surveyed, and very laborious that is at times;
    but the survey is not the end.
The great moments in science come when men of imagination sit down and think about the findings&mdash;when they recreate the landscape of nature under the survey.

Science must be solidly grounded in fact and in experiment.
But a blind search for experimental facts is not enough;
    it could never have discovered the theory of relativity.
Science is a way of looking at things, an insight, a vision.
And the theories of science are the underlying patterns that this way of looking at the world reveals.
Many of the patterns are unexpected even at the simplest beginnings.
(For example, common sense would not even have expected to find that stars and human beings are put together from the same basic building bricks of matter.)
And the more unexpected the pattern, the greater the feat of imagination that is needed to see it for the first time.

What place have these imaginative ideas of science in our daily thoughts?
Science and technology have transformed the physical world we live in;
    but have they yet had much effect on thought?
Many people even dislike the ideas of science, and feel that they are abstract and mechanical.
They reject science because they fear that it is in some way inhuman.

This book shows that science is as much a creation of the human imagination as art is.
Science and art are not opposites; they spring from the same human impulses.
In this last chapter, we shall examine their relations to one another, in the past and today.
In particular, we shall see how both enter and combine into the way man in the twentieth century sees the world: the vision of our age.
For this purpose, we shall include personal statements about their own work by an artist, an architect, a scientist, and a writer.

The artist is the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi.
The &ldquo;group of pictures show him in his studio, then one of his sculptures being cast in the foundry, then&rdquo; one of his finished sculptures called San Sebastian&mdash;with a jet engine standing in the background&mdash;and finally another recent work.

This is what Eduardo Paolozzi had to say about his work and the world for which it is made.

&lsquo;I am a sculptor, which means that I make images.
As a sculptor I was taught at the Slade the classical idea of being an artist.
The best one could do would be to emulate Victorian ideals and to work in a studio executing portraits or monuments.

&lsquo;But there has been a rejection now of the classical idea of tracing art out of art, which is in a way a sort of death process leading to the provincial gallery, with the atmosphere of the death-watch beetle&mdash;a gilt-edged, sure-thing idea of art.

&lsquo;In this century we have found a new kind of freedom&mdash;an opening up of what is possible to the artist as well as to the scientist.
So I don&#39;t make copies of conventional works of art.
I&#39;m not working for Aunt Maud; I&#39;m trying to do things which have a meaning for us living today.
So I work with objects which are casual and natural today, that is, mechanisms and throwaway objects.
To me they are beautiful, as my children are beautiful, though in a different way.
I think they are different definitions of beauty.

&lsquo;I haven&#39;t got any desire to make a sculpture of my children; but a wheel, a jet engine, a bit of a machine is beautiful, if one chooses to see it in that way.
It&#39;s even more beautiful if one can improve it, by incorporating it in one&#39;s iconography.
For instance, something like the jet engine is an exciting image if you&#39;re a sculptor.
I think it can quite fairly sit in the mind as an art image as much as an Assyrian wine jar.
I think it&#39;s a beautifully logical image, in the sense that anything in its delicate structure, with its high precision standards, has got a reason, almost in a way like human anatomy.

&lsquo;My San Sebastian was a sort of God I made out of my own necessity; a very beautiful young man being killed by arrows, which has a great deal of symbolism in it.
I think this is a good thing for young artists to identify themselves with, in a way that doing the Madonna and Child may not be a thing they can identify themselves with.
It has two legs, which are decorated columns, it has a rather open, symbolical square torso, with disguised, warped, twisted, mechanic elements.
Then the final element is a sort of drum with a space cut in the middle.


&lsquo;What I feel about using the human diagram is that it points up in a more specific way the relationship between man and technology.
There isn&#39;t any point in having a good idea in sculpture unless there is some kind of plastic or formal organisation.
So I don&#39;t reproduce the jet engine, I transform it.
And I use the wheel a lot in my sculpture as a symbol, as a quickly read symbol, of the man-made object.
This also refers back to my crude peasant idea of science, which is that the wheel gives the idea of man being able to get off the ground.
The wheel to me is important, and the clock.
I think this is very significant&mdash;I find the clock moving because I find modem science moving.
I see it as a sort of heroic symbolism.


&lsquo;In the last fifty years, science seems to be the outstanding leading direction, the most considerable direction that man has taken.
It is trying continually to go beyond what was possible till that very moment.
I think there is a possibility in what I call, crudely, higher science, a tremendous possibility of man being free.
And I think it can give me a certain kind of moral strength, in the sense that art can move into a similar category of freedom.
In my sculpture I am trying to speak for the way people are freeing themselves from traditional ideas.
I&#39;m a sculptor and so I put these ideas into images.
If I do this well they&#39;ll be heroic images, ones that will survive and ones which other ages will recognise.
Image making gives me the sense of freedom in a way that nothing else can.&rsquo;

A word to which Paolozzi returns several times is &lsquo;free&rsquo;. He feels that science frees man, from his conventions, from the restrictions of his environment, from his own fears and self-doubts.
If this is true, then man has gained this growing freedom by imagination: in science, by imagining things that have not yet happened.
Paolozzi wants to communicate the same sense of growing freedom in the images of his sculpture.
He wants people to feel that they are heroic images.

Science and art are both imaginative activities, and they present two sides of the imagination.
The two sides have often tried and often failed to come together, in the past and in recent time.
This chapter itself, and this book, is an attempt to help bring them together.
Paolozzi&#39;s work is also an attempt to bring them together, in a different language.
He uses the everyday products of technology (the stamped shapes in the first picture, for example) as the raw material of his art, because they seem to him as natural and expressive in modern civilisation as the human body itself.

It is interesting to look at the two sides of the human imagination in an earlier civilisation.
We have evidence for them, long even before writing was invented.
These paintings, in the caves of Lascaux in southern France, are at least twenty thousand years old.
They are the most famous and the finest examples of art from the Stone Age. The word &#39;art&#39;
is not out of place, and yet it is most unlikely that
these pictures were created in the same spirit as classical art.
The caves of Lascaux were not a Stone Age art gallery that people came to visit.
Art of this kind was an integral part of the civilisation of Stone Age man.


The Lascaux paintings are a product of one side of the imagination of the men who lived twenty thousand years ago.
This picture shows a product of the other side of their imagination.
It is a tool: a harpoon, cut from bone.
It has barbs, like a modem fish hook, to stop it from being pulled out when it lodges in an animal.


The next picture shows a tool again, and of a subtler kind.
It does not look as impressive as the harpoon, yet it is in fact a more far-sighted invention.
For it is a tool for making tools: it is a stone graver of the sort that must have been used to cut the barbs in the harpoon.
The men who invented this were able to think beyond the immediate needs of the day&mdash;killing an animal, cutting it up, scraping its hide.
When they invented a tool for making tools (today we should call that a machine-tool) they took a new step of the imagination.


What is the link between paintings on the wall of a cave, and primitive tools made of bone and flint?
Separated as we are by twenty thousand years from the men who created both, we can only speculate.
But we are surely right in speculating that the paintings served some purpose other than mere decoration.
Look at another Lascaux painting.
It represents three bulls and (probably) a boar.
A bull is being struck by a spear with barbs&mdash;a spear like the one that we have seen.
This is plainly a hunting scene.
Many of the other cave paintings show similar scenes.
The painters were constantly preoccupied with hunting.
This is why most authorities agree that the paintings were some kind of magic, and were intended to help the hunter to dominate the animal before the hunt started.


Unhappily, &lsquo;magic&rsquo; is one of those words (&lsquo;instinct&rsquo; is another) that does not really explain anything.
It merely says that we do not know the explanation.
What kind of magic were the painters making?
What did they feel they were doing for the hunters?
How did they think that they were helping them to dominate the hunted animal?


Here I will give my personal view.
I think that the paintings helped the men who painted them, and the men who lived in the caves with them, to conquer their fear of the hunted animal.
A bull was (and is) a dangerous beast, and out in the open there would not be much time to think about him.
By drawing him you become familiar with him, get used to the idea of meeting and hunting him, and imagine ways in which he can be outwitted.
The close-up makes the bull familiar to you; and the familiar is never as frightening as the unknown.


It is not far-fetched here to draw an analogy with modem methods of training.
Consider, for example, the training of spacemen.
They have to face a frightening situation, in which what they fear is simply the unfamiliar and unknown.
They will not survive if they panic; they will do the wrong thing.
So a long and life-like training programme is designed to make them familiar in advance with every situation that they are likely to encounter.
The spaceman&#39;s training is more than a matter of simply learning to press the right buttons.
It is also a psychological preparation for the unknown.


I believe that the Stone Age cave paintings were also a psychological preparation for the unknown.


They helped the Stone Age hunters to dominate their psychological environment, just as flint and bone tools helped them to dominate their physical environment.
That is the connecting link between the two.
Both are tools, that is, instruments which man uses to free himself and to overcome the limitations of nature.
It was Benjamin Franklin who first defined man as &lsquo;the tool-making animal&rsquo;.
He was right, and the tools are mental as well as physical.


We move forward now many thousand years, to a time and place where the two sides of the human imagination worked more closely together than ever before, and perhaps ever since.
The pictures on the right come from Athens of the fifth century B.C.
The men who built this city had suddenly burst out of the confines of the cave and come into the light of freedom.
Their civilisation recognised that man&#39;s most powerful tool in the command of nature is the human mind.
The Greeks named their city, and the great temple of the Parthenon in it, after the goddess of wisdom, Athene. Light and reason, logic and imagination together dominated their civilisation.


Greek architecture, for example, has a strong mathematical basis, yet it never appears stiff and mechanical.
Look at the Parthenon, as perfect a creation in architecture as man has made; and it is dominated by a precise sense of numbers.
Numbers had a mystical significance for the Greeks (Pythagoras made them almost into a religion) and this expressed itself in all they did.


The Parthenon has 8 columns along the front and 17 along each side.
That to the Greeks was the ideal proportion.
The number of columns along each side of a temple should be twice the number along the front, plus one more.
No Greek architect would have built otherwise.


Numbers that are perfect squares seemed to the Greeks equally fascinating and beautiful.
The Parthenon is 4 units wide and 9 units long; for 4 is the square of 2, and 9 is the square of 3&mdash;the two smallest squares.
The ratio of height to width along the front of the building is also 4 to 9; and so is the ratio of the thickness of the columns to the distance between them.


Yet all this arithmetic is not a dead ritual.
The Greeks found it exciting because they found it in natural objects.
To them, it expressed the mystery of nature, her inner structure.
Numbers were a key to the way the world is put together: this was the belief that inspired their science and their art together.


So the Parthenon is nowhere merely a set of mathematical relations.
The architect is guided by the numbers, but he is never hidebound by them.


His plan begins with arithmetic, but after that the architect himself has taken command of the building, and has given it freedom, lightness and rhythm.
For example, the end columns are closer to their neighbours than are the other columns; and the end columns are also a little thicker.
This is to make the building compact, to make it seem to look inwards at the corners.
And all the columns lean slightly inwards, in order to give the eye (and therefore the building) a feeling of upward movement and of lightness.


The pictures on the right are of the Erictheum.
It stands close to the Parthenon, but is less famous.
Perhaps that is because the Erictheum is less monumental, more slender, more delicate in its whole conception.
Yet the mathematics is still there.
The porch of the Erictheum, for instance, is designed on the &lsquo;golden section&rsquo;.
That is, the canopy has the same proportion to the base as the base has to the human figures which support the canopy.
The golden section was a mathematical relation which was based on nature: on the proportions of the human body.


The human figures which support the canopy are made to seem in movement; two rest on the right foot, two on the left.
Everywhere in the Erictheum there is the feeling of movement.
The different levels of the building are joined together with suppleness and rhythm.
This is what the Erictheum expresses in architecture: an almost musical sense of rhythm.
And this reminds us that Pythagoras prided himself, rightly, on having discovered the mathematical structure of the musical scale.


The fusion of the mathematical order with the human, of reason with imagination, was the triumph of Greek civilisation.
The artists accepted the mathematics, and the mathematicians did not resent the architects imposing their individuality on the mathematical framework.
It was a civilisation which expressed itself in the way things were put together&mdash;buildings, ideas, society itself.
Greek architecture survives to illustrate this, perhaps better than any other record.


All architecture must begin with technical efficiency.
Walls have to stand up, roofs have to keep the rain out.
So an architect can never be unpractical, as can a painter or a sculptor.
He cannot be content with the mere look of the thing.
The side of the human imagination which made the Stone Age tools cannot be left out.
But a bad architect can play it down, and can take the practical for granted, as a painter takes his canvas for granted.


The strength of the best architecture today is that it does not despise the practical purposes of buildings.
It does not hide the structure and function under merely elegant decoration.
Structure and function in modern buildings play the same fundamental part as numbers in Greek architecture.
They form the framework on which the architect imposes his individual imagination.
And he does not pretend that the framework is not there.


Our next personal statement comes from a famous architect, Eero Saarinen.
He was born in Finland but built most of his great buildings in America.
The pictures below show the building that he did not live to finish, the TWA Air Terminal at Idlewild Airport in New York.
The lines of the building are very dramatic, and the form is consciously mathematical and aerodynamic.
The question is: Is the bold, flying shape necessary, or is it a romantic artifice without a true function?
I discussed this with Eero Saarinen during the building, and this is how he replied.


To really answer your question, I would have to go a little bit back, and talk philosophically about architecture.
As you know, we all, in architecture, have been working in this modern style, and certain principles have grown up within it.
The basic principles are really three.
There is the functional part.
There is the structural part, honestly expressing the structure of the building.
And the third thing is that the building must be an expression of our time.
In other words, the technology of our time must be expressed in a building.


&lsquo;Now those are the principles that we are all agreed on&mdash;the principles that one might have said ten years ago were the only principles. 
I think since that time more thought and maybe some more principles have grown up. 
I would say one of these additional principles, one which I believe in, is that where buildings have a truly significant purpose they should also express that purpose.&rsquo;

Function and purpose were not the same thing in Saarinen&#39;s mind.
The TWA Air Terminal has a clear function: to handle passengers into and out of aeroplanes.
But for Saarinen, it also had a deeper purpose: from here people were to fly, and he wanted to give them the sense of freedom and adventure which flying has for earth-bound men.
The vaulted shapes of the building were well-conceived as structures, but they were meant to be more: their aerodynamic and birdlike look was to express what Saarinen called the purpose&mdash;the sense of going off to fly.
And the long spurs reaching out from the building show that it is not something self-contained, an end-point.
They suggest entering the building and leaving it, which is of course what the passengers do.

Eero Saarinen went on:

&lsquo;The last thing that I&#39;ve become convinced of, and I&#39;m not the only one, there are many others, is that once you&#39;ve set the design, it must create an architectural unity.
The idea of the barrel vaults making the roof of the Air Terminal building is carried through in all the details, even the furnishings.

&lsquo;Basically architecture is an art, though it is halfway between an art and a science.
In a way it straddles the two.
I think to a large degree the motivating force in the designing of architecture comes from the arts side.
If you ask. Are these curves
and everything derived from mathematics?
the answer is No.
They are sympathetic with the forces within the vaults, which is mathematical, but there are so many choices which one has, and these really come from the aesthetic side.

&lsquo;To me architecture is terribly important because it is really an expression of the whole age.
After we&#39;re dead and gone, we&#39;re going to be judged by our architecture, by the cities we leave behind us, just as other times have been.
What man does with architecture in his own time gives him belief in himself and in the whole period. 
Architecture is not just a servant of society, in a sense it&#39;s a leader of society.&rsquo;

Architecture straddles art and science.
That statement is true of the Greek architecture of two thousand years ago as well as of the architecture of today.
In this, the Greek imagination is close to our own.
The Greeks were preoccupied with the idea of structure;
    and we have seen in this book that the idea of structure is also central to modern science.
Like the Greeks, the modern scientist is always looking at the way things are put together, the bones beneath the skin.
How often in this book have we used such phrases as &lsquo;the architecture of matter&rsquo;!

For example, the Greeks invented the idea of the atom as the smallest unit of matter from which everything in the world is built.
Plato thought there were five kinds of atom, and he pictured them as the five regular solids of geometry.
The first four were the atoms of the four kinds of matter: earth, air, fire, and water; one of these is shown in the first picture below.
The fifth was the universe itself, the unity of the other four&mdash;we still call it the quintessence;
    it is shown, as Plato imagined it, in the second picture.

This conception is fantastic, and the atoms it pictures have no relation to the facts.
And yet the fanciful pictures are a first attempt to solve, imaginatively, the same problems of structure and behaviour that the modern physicist faces.
The Greek conception and the modern theories about atoms are both attempts to explain the bewildering complexity of the observable world in terms of an underlying, unifying order.
Greek scientific theories are now only of historical interest.
Yet before the Greeks, no one had thought about the world in this way at all.
Without them, there would have been no modern science.
It was the Greeks who first formulated the problems that modern science tries to answer.


Our third personal statement comes from a physicist: Professor Abdus Salam, of the Imperial College of Science in London.
He describes some modern ideas about atoms.
They are a long way from Plato&#39;s regular solids; yet, as Professor Salam points out, that is where they started.
Here is what Salam said.

&lsquo;I am a theoretical physicist, and we theoretical physicists are engaged on the following problem.
We would like to understand the entire complexity of inanimate matter in terms of as few fundamental concepts as possible.
This is not a new quest.
It&#39;s the quest which humanity has had from the beginning of time&mdash;the Greeks were engaged on it.
They conceived of all matter as being made up of fire, water, earth and air.
The Arabs had their ideas about it too.
Scientists have been worried about this all through the centuries.
The nearest man came to solving this problem was in 1931 when, through the work done in the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, we believed that all matter consisted of just two particles&mdash;electrons and protons&mdash;and all forces of nature were essentially of two kinds, the gravitational force and the electrical force.

&lsquo;Now we know that this view of 1931 was erroneous.
Since that time the number of particles has increased to thirty, and the number of elementary forces to four.
In addition to the electrical and gravitational forces, we now believe that there are two other types of force, both nuclear&mdash;one extremely strong, and the other extremely weak.
And the task we are engaged on is to try to reduce this seeming complexity to something which is simple and elementary.


&lsquo;Now the type of magic which we use in order to solve our problem is first to rely on the language which we use throwing up ideas of its own.
The language which we use in our subject is the language of mathematics, and the best example of the language throwing up ideas is the work of Dirac in 1928, He started with the idea that he would like to combine the theory of relativity and the theory of quantum mechanics. He proceeded to do this by writing a mathematical equation, which he solved.
And to his astonishment, and to everyone&#39;s astonishment, it was found that this equation described not only the particles&mdash;electrons and protons&mdash;which Dirac had designed the equation for, but also particles of so-called anti-matter&mdash;anti-electrons, anti-protons.

&lsquo;So in one stroke Dirac had increased the number of particles to twice the number.
There are the particles of matter, there are the particles of antimatter.
In a sense, of course, this produces simplicity too, because when I speak of thirty particles, really fifteen of them are particles and fifteen of them are anti-particles.
The power of mathematics as a language that suggests and leads you on to something, which we in theoretical physics are very familiar with, reminds me of the association of ideas which follows when possibly a great poet is composing poetry.
He has a certain rhyme, and the rhyme itself suggests the next idea, and so on.
That is one type of way in which invention comes about.


&lsquo;The second type of idea which we use to solve our problems is the idea of making a physical picture.
A very good illustration is the work of the Japanese physicist Yukawa in 1935.
Yukawa started to ponder on the problem of the attractive force between two protons, and he started with the following picture.
Suppose there are two cricketers, who have a cricket ball, and they decide to exchange the ball.
One throws the ball and the other catches it, perhaps.
Suppose they want to go on exchanging the ball, to and fro, between them.
Then the fact that they must go on exchanging the ball means that they must keep within a certain distance of each other.


&lsquo;The result is the following picture.
If one proton emits something which is captured by the second one, and the second one emits something which is captured by the first one, then the fact that they have to capture, emit, re-absorb constantly means that they will remain within a certain distance of each other.
And someone who cannot see this intermediate object, this ball, the object we call the meson, will think that these two protons have an attractive force between them.
This was Yukawa&#39;s way of explaining the attractive force between two elementary particles.


&lsquo;The result of Yukawa&#39;s work was that he predicted that there do exist such particles which play the role of intermediate objects.
And he predicted that such particles would have a mass about three hundred times that of electrons.
Yukawa made this prediction in 1935.
In 1938 these particles were discovered, and we now firmly believe that the forces of nature, all forces of nature, are transmitted by this type of exchange of intermediary particles.

&lsquo;Now so far I have been talking about our methods, but what is really important are our aims.
Our aim in all this is to reduce the complexity of the thirty elementary particles and the four fundamental forces into something which is simple and beautiful.
And to do this what we shall most certainly need is a break from the type of ideas which I have expressed&mdash;a complete break from the past, and a new and audacious idea of the type which Einstein had at the beginning of this century.
An idea of this type comes perhaps once in a century, but that is the sort of thing which will be needed before this complexity is reduced to something simple.&rsquo;


The ideas put forward by Salam are vivid.
But more than the specific ideas, we are interested here in his description of science itself.
For him, science is the attempt to find in the complexity of nature something which is simple and beautiful.
This is quite different from the usual view that science collects facts and uses them to make machines and gadgets.
Salam sees science as a truly imaginative activity, with a poetic language of its own.
This is an arresting point that Salam made: that the mathematics in science is a poetic language, because it spontaneously throws up new images, new ideas.


Science can learn from the language of poetry, and literature can learn from the language of science.
Here we bring in our fourth contributor.
He is Lawrence Durrell, who wrote the four famous books which make up The Alexandria Quartet.
In this four-fold novel, space and time are treated in an unusual way, and Durrell began by talking about this


&lsquo;I was hunting for a form which I thought might deliver us from the serial novel, and in playing around with the notions of relativity it seemed to me that if Einstein were right some very curious byproducts of his idea would emerge.
For example, that truth was no longer absolute, as it was to the Victorians, but was very provisional and very much subject to the observer&#39;s view.

&lsquo;And while I felt that many writers had been questing around to find a new form, I think they hadn&#39;t succeeded.
I don&#39;t know of course, I&#39;ve only read deeply in French.
There may well be Russian or German novels which express this far better than I have.


&ldquo;But they hadn&#39;t expressed what I think Einstein would call the &#39;discontinuity&#39; of our existence, in the sense that we no longer live (if his reality is right) serially, historically, from youth to middle age, to death; but in every second of our lives is packed, in capsule form, a sort of summation of the whole.
That&#39;s one of the by-products of relativity that I got.


&ldquo;In questing around for a means of actually presenting this in such an unfamiliar form as a novel, 1 borrowed a sort of analogy, perhaps falsely, from the movie camera.
I&#39;d been working with one, and it seemed to me that when the camera traverses across a field and does a pan shot, it&#39;s a historic shot in the sense that it goes from A to B to C to D.
And if it starts with a fingernail and backtracks until you get a whole battlefield, that seemed to me a spatialisation.
It was rooted in the time sequence that it was spatialising; it was still enlarging spatially.

&lsquo;I tried to mix these two elements together, and see what would happen to ordinary human characters in what is after all a perfectly old-fashioned type of novel&mdash;an ordinary novel, only not serial.
I found, somewhat to my own surprise, that I was getting a kind of stereoscopic narrative, and getting a kind of stereophonic notion of character.
This excited me so much that I finished it and tried to add the dimension of time by moving the whole thing forward&mdash;you know, &ldquo;read our next issue&rdquo;&mdash;five years later.
And there it is, ready for the critics to play with.&rsquo;

Here are Lawrence Durrell&#39;s answers to some questions about his work:

Q. You said that you got from relativity the feeling that truth was provisional, or at least depended very much on the observer.
A. Well, the analogy again is the observer&#39;s position in time and space.
    It&#39;s so to speak the fulcrum out of which his observation grows, and in that sense it is not an absolute view, it&#39;s provisional.
    The subject matter is conditioned by the observer&#39;s point of view.

Q. You&#39;re really making the point that the most important thing that relativity says is that there are no absolutes?
A. I was saying, most important for me.
    I think that any average person who&#39;s not a mathematician would assume that that was probably the most important part of it.

Q. I want to recall another phrase that you&#39;ve just used.
    You said of your novel that &lsquo;after all it&#39;s a perfectly old-fashioned novel&rsquo;.
    Now I don&#39;t feel that.
    I feel that your novel could have been written at no time but in the twentieth century.
A. Yes, in that sense certainly.
    But I was trying to distinguish between the form which, I believe, if it has come off at all, is original, and the content.
    When I was building the form I did something new.
    I said to myself, this is the shape: there are three sides of space, one of time.
    How do I shift this notion into such an unusual domain as the novel?
    And at the back of my mind I wondered whether we in the novel couldn&#39;t escape our obsession with time only.

Q. Your dimensions, as it were, deepen out each character as a recession in space.
    You show how different he becomes when he is seen by someone else from another point.
A. Stereoscopically, you see.

Q. I want to ask you a crucial question.
    Do you feel that the kind of inspiration that you&#39;ve drawn from the scientific idea of relativity here is valid for everyone?
    That we can all in some way make a culture which combines science and the arts?
A. Surely a balanced culture must do that.
    And I think all the big cultures of the past have never made very rigid distinctions.
    Also I think that the very great artists, the sort of universal men, Goethe for example, are as much scientists as artists.
    When Goethe wasn&#39;t writing poetry he was nourishing himself on science.

Q. We can&#39;t expect everybody to be a Goethe, so how are we going to unify what is obviously different&mdash;the sense of what the artist is doing and the sense of what the scientist is doing?
A. I think by understanding that in every generation the creative part of the population feels called upon to try and attack this mysterious riddle of what we&#39;re doing, and to give some account of themselves.
    We&#39;re up against a dualism, because some people have more intelligence and less emotion, and vice versa. So the sort of account they give may suddenly come out in a big poem like Dante&#39;s, or it may come out in a Newtonian concept.
    In other words, the palm isn&#39;t equally given in each generation.
    But I feel that they&#39;re linked hand in hand in this attack on what the meaning of it all is.

The meaning of it all: the meaning of the pattern of nature, and of man&#39;s place in nature.
Durrell&#39;s quest is also Salam&#39;s quest, and Saarinen&#39;s, and Paolozzi&#39;s.
It is the quest of every man, whether scientist or artist or man in the street.

The driving force in man is the search for freedom from the limitations which nature has imposed.
Man, unlike the animals, is able to free himself.
The first crude attempts were already made by Stone Age man with his tools and paintings.
Now, twenty thousand years later, we are still struggling for freedom.
We try to reach it by understanding the meaning of things.
Our age tries to see things from the inside, and to find the structure, the architecture which underlies the surface appearance of things.
We command nature by understanding her logic.

Our age has found some unexpected turns in the logic of nature.
How atoms evolve, much like living species.
How living things code and pass on their pattern of life, much like a machine.
How the rigorous laws of nature are averaged from the million uncertainties of atoms and individuals.
How time itself is an averaging and a disordering, a steady loss of the exceptional.

How life opposes time by constantly re-creating the exceptional.
And how profoundly our ideas of so safe and absolute a concept as time once seemed to be can be changed by the vision of one man, who saw and proved that time is relative.

Above all, our age has shown how these ideas, and all human ideas, are created by one human gift: imagination.
We leave the animals behind because they have no language of images.
Imagination is the gift by which man creates a vision of the world.

We in the twentieth century have a vision which unifies not only the physical world but the world of living things and the world of the mind.
We have a much greater sense of person than any other age.
We are more free than our ancestors from the limitations both of our physical and of our psychological environments.

We are persons in our own right as no-one was before us.
It is not only that we can travel into space and under the oceans.
Nor is it only that psychology has made us more at home with ourselves.
It is a real sense of unity with nature.
We see nature not as a thing but as a process, profound and beautiful;
    and we see it from the inside.
We belong to it.
This above all is what science has given us: the vision of our age.
