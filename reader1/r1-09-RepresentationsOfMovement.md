Matter, the physical basis of all spatial experience and thus the source material of representation, is kinetic in its very essence.
From atomic happenings to cosmic actions, all elements in nature are in perpetual interaction&mdash;in a flux complete. We are living a mobile existence.
The earth is rotating; the sun is moving;
    trees are growing; flowers are opening and closing;
    clouds are merging, dissolving, coming and going;
    light and shadow are hunting each other in an indefatigable play;
    forms are appearing and disappearing; and man, who is experiencing all this, is himself subject to all kinetic change.
The perception of physical reality cannot escape the quality of movement.
The very understanding of spatial facts, the meaning of extension or distances, involves the notion of time&mdash;a fusion of space-time which is movement.
&ldquo;Nobody has ever noticed a place except at a time or a time except at a place,&rdquo; said Minkowsky in his <em>Principles of Relativity</em>.

## The sources of movement perception

As in a wild jungle one cuts new paths in order to progress further, man builds roads of perception on which he is able to approach the mobile world, to discover order in its relationships.
To build these avenues of perceptual grasp he relies on certain natural factors.
One is the nature of the retina, the sensitive surface on which the mobile panorama is projected.
The second is the sense of movement of his body&mdash;the kinesthetic sensations of his eye muscles, limbs, head, which have a direct correspondence with the happenings around him.
The third is the memory association of past experience, visual and non-visual;
    his knowledge about the laws of the physical nature of the surrounding object-world.

### The shift of the retinal image

We perceive any successive stimulation of the retinal receptors as movement, because such progressive stimulations are in dynamic interaction with fixed stimulations, and therefore the two different types of stimulation can be perceived in a unified whole only as a dynamic process, movement.
If the retina is stimulated with stationary impacts that follow one another in rapid succession,
    the same sensation of optical movement is induced.
Advertising displays with their rapidly flashing electric bulbs are perceived in continuity through the persistence of vision and therefore produce the sensation of movement,
    although the spatial position of the light bulbs is stationary.
The movement in the motion picture is based upon the same source of the visual perception.

The changes of any optical data indicating spatial relationships,
    such as size, shape, direction, interval, brightness, clearness, color, imply motion.
If the retinal image of any of these signs undergoes continuous regular change,
    expansion or contraction, progression or graduation,
    one perceives an approaching or receding, expanding or contracting movement.
If one sees a growing or disappearing distance between these signs,
    he perceives a horizontal or vertical movement.

&ldquo;Suppose for instance, that a person is standing still in a thick woods,
    where it is impossible for him to distinguish,
    except vaguely and roughly in a mass of foliage and branches all around him,
    what belongs to one tree and what to another, and how far the trees are separated.
The moment he begins to move forward, however,
    everything disentangles itself and immediately he gets an apperception of the content of the woods and the relationships of objects to each other in space.&rdquo;
    %\footnote{Helmholtz, Physiological Optics}

From a moving train, the closer the object the faster it seems to move.
A far-away object moves slowly and one very remote appears to be stationary.
The same phenomenon, with a lower relative velocity, may be noticed in walking, and with a still higher velocity in a landing aeroplane or in a moving elevator. 

## The role of relative velocity

The velocity of motion has an important conditioning effect.
Motion can be too fast or too slow to be perceived as such by our limited sensory receiving set.
The growth of trees or of man, the opening of flowers, the evaporation of water are movements beyond the threshold of ordinary visual grasp.
One does not see the movement of the hand of a watch, of a ship on a distant horizon.
An aeroplane in the highest sky seems to hang motionless.
No one can see the traveling of light as such.
In certain less rapid motions beyond the visual grasp, one is able, however, to observe the optical transformation of movement into the illusion of a solid.
A rapidly whirled torch loses its characteristic physical extension, but it submerges into another three-dimensional-appearing solid&mdash;into the virtual volume of a cone or a sphere.
Our inability to distinguish sharply beyond a certain interval of optical impacts makes the visual impressions a blur which serves as a bridge to a new optical form.
The degree of velocity of its movement will determine the apparent density of that new form.
The optical density of the visible world is in a great degree conditioned by our visual ability, which has its particular limitations.


## The kinesthetic sensation

When a moving object comes into the visual field,
    one pursues it by a corresponding movement of his eyes,
    keeping it in a stationary or nearly stationary position on the retina.
Retinal stimulation, then, cannot alone account for the sensation of movement.
Movement-experience, which is undeniably present in such a case,
    is induced by the sensation of muscle movements.
Each individual muscle-fibre contains a nerve end,
    which registers every movement the muscle makes.
That we are able to sense space in the dark,
    evaluate direction-distances in the absence of contacted bodies,
    is due to this muscular sensation&mdash;the kinesthetic sensation.

## Memory sources

Experience teaches man to distinguish things and to evaluate their physical properties.
He knows that bodies have weight: unsupported they will of necessity fall.
When, therefore, he sees in midair a body he knows to be heavy,
    he automatically associates the direction and velocity of its downward course.
One is also accustomed to seeing small objects as more mobile than large ones.
A man is more mobile than a mountain;
    a bird is more frequently in motion than a tree,
    the sky.
    or other visible units in its background. Everything that one experiences is perceived in
a polar unity in which one pole is accepted as a stationary background
and the other as a mobile, changing figure.

Through all history painters have tried to suggest movement on the stationary picture surface,
    to translate some of the optical signs of movement-experience into terms of the picture-image.
Their efforts, however,
    have been isolated attempts in which one or the other sources of movement-experience were drawn upon; the shift of the retinal image,
    the kinesthetic experience, or the memory of past experiences were suggested in two-dimensional terms.

These attempts were conditioned mainly by the habit of using things as the basic measuring unit for every event in nature.
The constant characteristics of the things and objects,
    first of all the human body, animals, sun, moon, clouds, or trees,
    were used as the first fixed points of reference in seeking relationships in the optical turmoil of happenings.

Therefore, painters tried first to represent motion by suggesting the visible modifications of objects in movement.
They knew the visual characteristics of stationary objects and therefore every observable change served to suggest movement.
The prehistoric artist knew his animals, knew, for example, how many legs they had.
But when he saw an animal in really speedy movement,
    he could not escape seeing the visual modification of the known spatial characteristics.
The painter of the Altamiro caves who pictures a running reindeer with numerous legs,
    or the twentieth century cartoonist picturing a moving face with many superimposed profiles,
    is stating a relationship between what he knows and what he sees.

Other painters, seeking to indicate movement, utilized the expressive distortion of the moving bodies.
Michaelangelo, Goya, and also Tintoretto, by elongating and stretching the figure,
    showed distortion of the face under the expression of strains of action and mobilized numerous other psychological references to suggest action.

The smallest movement is more possessive of the attention than the greatest wealth of relatively stationary objects.
Painters of many different periods observed this well and explored it creatively.
The optical vitality of the moving units they emphasized by dynamic outlines,
    by a vehement interplay of vigorous contrast of light and dark,
    and by extreme contrast of colors.
In various paintings of Tintoretto, Maffei, Veronese, and Goya,
    the optical wealth and intensity of the moving figures are juxtaposed against the submissive,
    neutral, visual pattern of the stationary background.


The creative exploitation of the successive stimulations of the retinal receptors in terms of the picture surface was another device many painters found useful.
Linear continuance arrests the attention and forces the eye into a pursuit movement.
The eye, following the line,
    acts as if it were on the path of a moving thing and attributes to the line the quality of movement.
When the Greek sculptors organized the drapery of their figures which they represented in motion,
    the lines were conceived as optical forces making the eye pursue their direction.

We know that a heavy object in a background that does not offer substantial resistance will fall.
Seeing such an object we interpret it as action.

We make a kind of psychological qualification.
Every object seen and interpreted in a frame of reference of gravitation is endowed with potential action and could appear as falling, rolling, moving.
Because we customarily assume an identity between the horizontal and vertical directions on the picture surface and the main directions of space as we perceive them in our everyday experiences,
    every placing of an object representation on the picture surface which contradicts the center of gravity, the main direction of space&mdash;the horizontal or vertical axis&mdash;causes that object to appear to be in action.
Top and bottom of the picture surface have a significance in this respect.

Whereas the visual representation of depth had found various complete systems,
    such as linear perspective, modelling by shading,
    a parallel development had never taken place in the visual representation of motion.
Possibly this has been because the tempo of life was comparatively slow;
    therefore, the ordering and representation of events could be compressed without serious repercussions in static formulations.
Events were measured by things, static forms identical with themselves,
    in a perpetual fixity.
But this static point of view lost all semblance of validity when daily experiences bombarded man with a velocity of visual impacts in which the fixity of the things,
    their self-identity, seemed to melt away.

The more complex life became, the more dynamic relationships confronted man,
    in general and in particular, as visual experiences,
    the more necessary it became to reevaluate the old relative conceptions about the fixity of things and to look for a new way of seeing that could interpret man&#39;s surroundings in their change.
It was no accident that our age made the first serious search for a reformulation of the events in nature into dynamic terms.
This reformulation of our ideas about the world included almost all the aspects one perceives.
The interpretation of the objective world in the terms of physics,
    the understanding of the living organism,
    the reading of the inner movement of social processes,
    and the visual interpretation of events were, and still are,
    struggling for a new gauge elastic enough to expand and contract in following the dynamic changes of events.

## The influence of the technological conditions

The environment of the man living today has a complexity which cannot be compared with any environment of any previous age.
The skyscrapers, the street with its kaleidoscopic vibration of colors, the window-displays with their multiple mirroring images, the street cars and motor cars, produce a dynamic simultaneity of visual impression which cannot be perceived in the terms of inherited visual habits.
In this optical turmoil the fixed objects appear utterly insufficient as the measuring tape of the events.
The artificial light, the flashing of electric bulbs, and the mobile game of the many new types of light-sources bombard man with kinetic color sensations having a keyboard never before experienced.
Man, the spectator, is himself more mobile than ever before.
He rides in streetcars, motorcars and aeroplanes and his own motion gives to optical impacts a tempo far beyond the threshold of a clear object-perception.
The machine man operates adds its own demand for a new way of seeing.
The complicated interactions of its mechanical parts cannot be conceived in a static way;
    they must be perceived by understanding of their movements.
The motion picture, television, and, in a great degree, the radio,
    require a new thinking, i.e., seeing, that takes into account qualities of change,
    interpenetration and simultaneity.

Man can face with success this intricate pattern of the optical events only as he can develop a speed in his perception to match the speed of his environment.
He can act with confidence only as he learns to orient himself in the new mobile landscape.
He needs to be quicker than the event he intends to master.
The origin of the word &ldquo;speed&rdquo; has a revealing meaning.
In original form in most languages, speed is intimately connected with success.
Space and speed are, moreover, in some early forms of languages,
    interchangeable in meaning.
Orientation, which is the basis of survival,
    is guaranteed by the speed of grasping the relationships of the events with which man is confronted.


## Social and psychological motivations

Significantly, the contemporary attempts to represent movement were made in the countries where the vitality of living was most handicapped by outworn social conditions.
In Italy, technological advances and their economical&ndash;social consequences,
    were tied with the relics of past ideas, institutions.
The advocates of change could see no clear, positive direction.
Change as they conceived it meant expansion, imperialist power policy.
The advance guard of the expanding imperialism identified the past with the monuments of the past,
    and with the keepers of these monuments;
    and they tried to break, with an uninhibited vandalism, everything which seemed to them to fetter the progress toward their goals.
&ldquo;We want to free our country from the fetid gangrene of professors, archaeologists, guides and antique shops,&rdquo; proclaimed the futurist manifesto of 1909.
The violence of imperialist expansion was identified with vitality;
    with the flux of life itself.
Everything which stood in the way of this desire of the beast to reach his prey was to be destroyed.
Movement, speed, velocity became their idols.
Destructive mechanical implements, the armoured train, machine gun,
    a blasting bomb, the aeroplane, the motor car&#39;, boxing,
    were adored symbols of the new virility they sought.
In Russia, where the present was also tied to the past and the people were struggling for the fresh air of action, interest also focused on the dynamic dualities of experience.
The basic motivation of reorientation toward a kinetic expression there was quite similar to that of the Italian futurists.
It was utter disgust with a present held captive by the past.
Russia&#39;s painters, writers, like Russia&#39;s masses,
    longed to escape into a future free from the ties of outworn institutions and habits.
Museums, grammar, authority, were conceived of as enemies;
    force, moving masses, moving machines were friends.
But this revolt against stagnant traditions,
    this savage ridiculing of all outworn forms,
    opened the way for the building of a broader world.
The old language, which as Mayakovsky said &ldquo;was too feeble to catch up with life,&rdquo;
    was reorganized into kinetic idioms of revolutionary propaganda.
The visual language of the past, from whose masters Mayakovsky asked with just scorn,
    &ldquo;Painters will you try to capture speedy cavalry with the tiny net of contours?&rdquo;
    was infused with new living blood of motion picture vision.

In their search to find an optical projection which conformed to the dynamic reality as they sensed and comprehended it,
    painters unconsciously repeated the path traced by advancing physical science.
Their first step was to represent on the same picture-plane a sequence of positions of a moving body.
This was basically nothing but a cataloging of stationary spatial locations.
The idea corresponded to the concept of classical physics,
    which describes objects existing in three-dimensional space and changing locations in sequence of absolute time.
The concept of the object was kept.
The sequence of events frozen on the picture-plane only amplified the contradiction between the dynamic reality and the fixity of the three-dimensional object-concept.

Their second step was to fuse the different positions of the object by filling out the pathway of their movement.
Objects were no longer considered as isolated, fixed units.
Potential and kinetic energies were included as optical characteristics.
The object was regarded to be either in active motion,
    indicating its direction by &ldquo;lines of force,&rdquo; or in potential motion,
    pregnant with lines of force, which pointed the direction in which the object would go if freed.
The painters thus sought to picture the mechanical point of view of nature,
    devising optical equivalents for mass,
    force, and gravitation.
This innovation signified important progress,
    because the indicated lines of forces could function as the plastic forces of two-dimensional picture-plane.

The third step was guided by desire to integrate the increasingly complicated maze of movement-directions.
The chaotic jumble of centrifugal line of forces needed to be unified.
Simultaneous representation of the numerous visible aspects composing an event was the new representational technique here introduced.
The cubist space analysis was synchronized with the line of forces.
The body of the moving object, the path of its movement and its background were portrayed in the same picture by fusing all these elements in a kinetic pattern.
The romantic language of the futurist manifestos describes the method thus:
    &ldquo;The simultaneosity of soul in a work of art; such is the exciting aim of our art.
In painting a figure on a balcony, seen from within doors,
    we shall not confine the view to what can be seen through the frame of the window;
    we shall give the sum total of the visual sensation of the street,
    the double row of houses extending right and left the flowered balconies, etc. \ldots in other words,
    a simultaneity of environment and therefore a dismemberment and dislocation of objects, a scattering and confusion of details independent of one and another and without reference to accepted logic,&rdquo; said Marinetti.
    This concept shows a great similarity to the idea expressed by
Einstein, expounding as a physicist the space-time interpretation of the
general theory of relativity.
&ldquo;The world of events can be described by a static picture thrown onto the background of the four dimensional time-space continuum.
In the past science described motion as happenings in lime, general theory of relativity interprets events existing in space-time.&rdquo;
The closest approximation to representation of motion in the genuine terms of the picture-plane was achieved by the utilization of color planes as the organizing factor.
The origin of color is light, and colors on the picture surface have an intrinsic tendency to return to their origin.
Motion, therefore, is inherent in color.
Painters intent on realizing the full motion potentialities of color believed that the image becomes a form only in the progressive interrelationships of opposing colors.
Adjacent color-surfaces exhibit contrast effects.
They reinforce each other in hue, saturation, and intensity.

The greater the intensity of the color-surfaces achieved by a carefully organized use of simultaneous and successive contrast,
    the greater their spatial movement color in regard to picture-plane.
Their advancing, receding, contracting and circulating movement on the surface creates a rich variety,
    circular, spiral, pendular, etc., in the process of moulding them into one form which is light or, in practical terms, grey.
&ldquo;Form is movement,&rdquo; declared Delaunay.
The classical continuous outline of the objects was therefore eliminated and a rhythmic discontinuity created by grouping colors in the greatest possible contrast.
The picture-plane, divided into a number of contrasting color-surfaces of different hue, saturation, and intensity, could be perceived only as a form, as a unified whole in the dynamic sequence of visual perception.
The animation of the image they achieved is based upon the progressive steps in bringing opposing colors into balance.

The centrifugal and centripetal forces of the contrasting color-planes move forward and backward, up and down, left and right, compelling the spectator to a kinetic participation as he follows the intrinsic spatial direction of colors.
The dynamic quality is based upon the genuine movement of plastic forces in their tendency toward balance.
Like a spinning top or the running wheel of a bicycle, which can find its balance only in movement, the plastic image achieves unity in movement, in perpetual relations of contrasting colors.
