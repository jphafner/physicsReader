intro: An article from <em>Scientific American</em>, 1960.
---


The preceding article leaves Homo sapiens in about 2500 B.C., after his invention of the city-state.
Our story does not really get under way until some 4,000 years later.
Thus, in turning to the next major revolution in man&#39;s impact on his environment, we seem to pass over almost all of recorded human history.
No revolution is without its antecedents, however.
Although the scientific-industrial age is a recent and original achievement of Western man, it has deep historical roots.

Western civilization is unique in its historical-mindedness as well as in its scientific character.
Behind it on the one hand are the ancient Jews, whose religious literature was largely historical, who preached a God of history, and taught that history was moving to a mighty end, not merely revolving in cycles of growth and decay.
On the other hand are the ancient Greeks.
Their literature has provided a training in logic, a stimulus to the exercise of the critical faculties and a wonderful grounding in mathematics and the physical sciences.

In western Europe civilization had a comparatively late start.
For thousands of years the lands at the eastern end of the Mediterranean had held the leadership in that whole section of the globe.
It was in the West, furthermore, that the Roman Empire really collapsed, and was overrun by &ldquo;barbarian invaders.&rdquo;
Here much of the ancient culture was lost, and society reverted to comparatively primitive forms.
In the meantime a high Byzantine civilization had its center in Constantinople, and a brilliant Arabian one in Baghdad.
It would be interesting to know why Western man, though he started late, soon proved himself to be so much more dynamic than the peoples farther to the east.

In the formative period of a civilization religion plays a more important part than we today can easily understand.
After the fall of the Roman Empire the comparatively primitive peoples in much of Europe were Christianized by conquest or through royal command;
    in the beginning it was a case of pagans merely changing the names of their gods.
But in the succeeding centuries of the Middle Ages the Church deepened spiritual life and moral earnestness.
It became the great educator, recovering ancient scholarship and acting as the patron of the arts.
By the 13th century there had developed a lofty culture, very much under the presidency of religion, but a religion that nourished the inner life, stimulated heart-searchings and examinations of conscience and set an eternal value upon each individual soul.
The Western tradition acquired a high doctrine of personality.

By the year 1500, when the Renaissance was at its height, the West had begun to take the command of world history.
The expansion of Islam had been contained.
The terrible Asian hordes, culminating in the Mongols and the Turks, that had overrun the eastern Mediterranean lands had been stopped in central Europe.
One of the reasons first for survival and then for progress in the West was its consolidation into something like nation-states, a form of polity more firm and more closely knit than the sprawling Asiatic empires.


Yet the Renaissance belongs perhaps to the old (that is, the medieval) world rather than to the new; it was still greatly preoccupied with the recovery of the lost learning of ancient Greece and Rome.
Its primary interest was not in scientific studies, but now, after something like a thousand years of effort, the West had recaptured virtually all it ever was to recover of ancient Greek scholarship and science.
Only after this stage had been reached could the really original developments in the study of the physical universe begin.
The Western mind was certainly becoming less other-worldly.
In the later Middle Ages there was much thought about the nature of man as well as about the nature of God, so that a form of Christian humanism had already been developing.
The Renaissance was essentially humanistic, stressing man as the image of God rather than as the doomed sinner, and it installed in western Europe the form of classical education that was to endure for centuries.
The philosophy of the time dwelt much on the dignity of man. Our modern Western values therefore have deep historic roots.

And the men of the Renaissance were still looking backward, knowing that the peak of civilization had been reached in remote antiquity, and then lost.
It was easy for them to see the natural process of history as a process of decline.

Signs of something more modern had begun to appear, but they belong chiefly to the realm of action rather than to that of thought.
Theories about the universe (about the movements of the planets, for example) had still to be taken over bodily from the great teachers of the ancient world.
On the other hand, in action Western man was already proving remarkably free and adventurous: in his voyages of discovery, in the development of mining and metallurgy and in the creative work of the Renaissance artists.
Under these conditions scientific thought might make little progress, but technology had been able to advance.
And perhaps it was the artist rather than the writer of books who, at the Renaissance, was the precursor of the modem scientist.

The artists had emancipated themselves from clerical influence to a great degree.
The Florentine painters, seeking the faithful reproduction of nature, sharpened observation and prepared the way for science.
The first of the sciences to be placed on a modern footing&mdash;that of anatomy&mdash;was one which the artists cultivated and which was governed by direct observation.
It was the artists who even set up the cry that one must not be satisfied to learn from the ancients or to take everything from books; one must examine nature for oneself.
The artists were often the engineers, the designers of fortifications, the inventors of gadgets, they were nearer to the artisan than were the scholars, and their studios often had the features of a laboratory or workshop.
It is not surprising to find among them Leonardo da Vinci&mdash;a precursor of modern science, but only a precursor, in spite of his brilliance, because the modern scientific method had not yet emerged.

Records show that in the 15th century a Byzantine scholar drew the attention of his fellow-country men to the technological superiority of the West.
He mentioned progress in machine saws, shipbuilding, textile and glass manufacture and the production of cast iron.
Three other items should be added to the list: the compass, gunpowder and the printing press.
Although they might not have originated in Christendom, they had not been handed down from classical antiquity.
They came to be the first concrete evidence generally adduced to show that the moderns might even excel the ancients.
Before 1500, artillery had assisted the consolidation of government on something like the scale of the nationstate.
Printing was to speed up intellectual communication, making possible the wider spread of a more advanced kind of education and facilitating the rise of a lay intelligentsia.


In setting the stage for modern developments the economic situation is of fundamental importance.
By this time a high degree of financial organization had been attained.
The countryside might look much as it had done for a thousand years, but the Renaissance flourished primarily in the city-states of Italy, the Netherlands and southern Germany, where commerce and industry had made great advances.
The forms of economic life were calculated to bring out individual enterprise; and in the cities the influence of priests declined&mdash;the lay intelligentsia now took the lead.
There had existed greater cities and even an essentially urban civilization in ancient times.
What was new was the form of the economic life, which, by the opportunities it gave to countless individuals, possessed dynamic potentialities.

It was a Western world already steeped in humanism that entered upon a great scientific and technological development.
But if Western man decided now to take a hand in shaping his own destiny, he did it, as on so many other occasions, only because he had been goaded by problems that had reduced him to desperation.
The decisive problems were not material ones, however.
They were baffling riddles presented to the intellect.

The authority of ancient scholarship was shaken when it came to be realized that the great Greek physician Galen had been wrong in some of his observations, primarily in those on the heart.
In the 16th century successive discoveries about the heart and the blood vessels were made in Padua, culminating a little later in William Harvey&#39;s demonstration in England of the circulation of the blood.
The whole subject was now set on a right footing, so that a flood of further discoveries was bound to follow very quickly.
Harvey&#39;s work was of the greatest importance, moreover, because it provided a pattern of what could be achieved by observation and methodical experiment.

The older kind of science came to shipwreck, however, over two problems connected with motion.
Aristotle, having in mind a horse drawing a cart, had imagined that an object could not be kept moving unless something was pulling or pushing it all the time.
On this view it was difficult to see why projectiles stayed in motion after they had become separated from the original propulsive force.
It was conjectured that a flying arrow must be pushed along by the rush of air that its previous motion had created, but this theory&#39; had been recognized to be unsatisfactory.
In the 16th century, when artillery had become familiar, the student of motion naturally tended to think of the projectile first of all.
Great minds had been defeated by this problem for centuries before Galileo altered the whole approach and saw motion as something that continued until something intervened to check it.

A great astronomical problem still remained, and Copernicus did not solve it alone.
Accepting the recognized data, he had shown chiefly that the neatest explanation of the old facts was the hypothesis of a rotating earth.
Toward the end of the century new appearances in the sky showed that the traditional astronomy was obsolete.
They demonstrated that the planets, for example, instead of being fixed to crystalline spheres that kept them in their proper courses, must be floating in empty space.
There was now no doubt that comets belonged to the upper regions of the sky and cut a path through what had been regarded as the hard, though transparent, spheres.
It was now not easy to see how the planets were held on a regular path.
Those who followed Copernicus in the view that the earth itself moved had to face the fact that the science of physics, as it then existed, could not possibly explain how the motion was produced.

In the face of such problems it began to be realized that science as a whole needed renovation.
Even in the 16th century people were beginning to examine the question of method.
In this case a great historic change was willed in advance and consciously attempted.
Men called for a scientific revolution before the change had occurred, and before they knew exactly what the situation demanded.
Francis Bacon, who tried to establish the basis for a new scientific method, even predicted the magnitude of its possible consequences&mdash;the power that man was going to acquire over nature.
It was realized, furthermore, that the authority of the ancient world, as well as that of the Middle Ages, was in question.
The French philosopher Rene Descartes insisted that thinking should be started over again on a clean slate.

The impulse for a scientific revolution came from the pressure of high intellectual needs, but the tools of civilization helped to give the new movement its direction.
In the later Middle Ages men had become more conscious of the existence of the machine, particularly through mechanical clocks.
This may have prepared them to change the formulation of their problems.
Instead of seeking the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of a thing, they were now more prepared to ask, even of nature, simply: How does it work? 

The student of the physical universe, like the artists before him, became more familiar with the workshop, learning manipulation from the artisan.
He interested himself in problems of the practical world: artillery, pumps, the determination of longitude.
Experimentation had long existed, but it now became more organized and methodical as the investigator became more conscious of what he was trying to do.
In the 1 7th century, moreover, scientific instruments such as the telescope and the microscope came into use.

But theory mattered too.
If Galileo corrected a fallacious view of motion, it was because his mind was able to change the formulation of the whole problem.
At least as important as his experimentation was his mathematical attack on the problem, which illustrated the potential role of mathematics in the transformation of science.


Another momentous factor in developing the new outlook was the revival of an ancient view: that matter is composed of infinitesimally small particles.
This view was now at last presented in a form that seemed consistent with Christianity (because the combinations of the particles which produced the varied world of physical things were no longer regarded as the mere product of chance), so that the atomic theory was able to acquire a wide currency.
It led to a better appreciation of the intricate texture of matter, and it proved to be the source of innumerable new hypotheses.
The theory seemed to open the way to a purely mechanical explanation of the universe, which should account for everything by the shape, the combination and the motion of the particles.
Long before such an explanation had been achieved, men were aspiring to it.
Even religious men were arguing that Creation itself would have been imperfect if God had not made a universe that was a perfectly regular machine.

The civilization that had begun its westward shift in the later Middle Ages was moving north and west.
At the Renaissance Italy still held the primacy, but with the Reformation the balance shifted more definitely to the north.
By the closing decades of the 17th century economic, technological and scientific progress centered on the English Channel.
The leadership now belonged to England, France and the Netherlands, the countries that had been galvanized by the commerce arising from the overseas discoveries of the 15th century.
And the pace was quickening.
Technique was developing apace, economic life was expanding and society was moving forward generally in an exhilarating way.

The solution of the main problems of motion, particularly the motion of the earth and the heavenly bodies, and the establishment of a new notion of scientific method, took a hundred years of effort after the crisis in the later decades of the 16th century.
A great number of thinkers settled single points, or made attempts that misfired.
In the period after 1660 a host of workers in Paris and London were making science fashionable and bringing the scientific revolution to its culmination.
Isaac Newton&#39;s Principia in 1687 synthesized the results of what can now be seen to have been a century of collaborative effort, and serves to signalize a new era.
Newton crowned the long endeavor to see the heavenly bodies as parts of a wonderful piece of clockwork.

The achievements of ancient Greece in the field of science had now been unmistakably transcended and outmoded.
The authority of both the ancient and the medieval worlds was overthrown, and Western man was fully persuaded that he must rely on his own resources in the future.
Religion had come to a low ebb after generations of fanaticism, persecution and war; now it was in a weak position for meeting the challenge of the new thought.
The end of the 18th century sees in any case the decisive moment in the secularization of European society and culture.
The apostles of the new movement had long been claiming that there was a scientific method which could be adapted to all realms of inquiry, including human studies&mdash;history, politics and comparative religion, for example.
The foundations of what has been called the age of reason had now been laid.

At the same time society itself was changing rapidly, and man could see it changing, see it as no longer static but dynamic.
There began to emerge a different picture of the process of things in time, a picture of history as the embodiment of progress rather than of decline.
The future now appeared to offer opening vistas and widening horizons.
Man was coming to feel more capable of taking charge over his own destiny.

It was not merely man&#39;s tools, and not merely natural science, that had carried the story forward.
The whole complex condition of society was involved, and movement was taking place on a wide front.
The age of Newton sees the foundation of the Bank of England and the national debt, as well as the development of speculation that was to culminate in the South Sea Bubble.
An economic order congenial to individualism meant that life was sprouting from multitudinous centers, initiatives were being taken at a thousand points and ingenuity was in constant exercise through the pressure of need or the assurance that it would have its reward.
The case is illustrated in 17th-century England by the famous &ldquo;projectors&rdquo;&mdash;financial promoters busy devising schemes for making money.
They slide easily into reformers making plans for female education or a socialistic order or a better form of government.

The whole of Western society was in movement, science and technology, industry and agriculture, all helping to carry one another along.
But one of the operations of society&mdash;war&mdash;had probably influenced the general course of things more than is usually recognized.
War above all had made it impossible for a king to &ldquo;live of his own,&rdquo; enabling his subjects to develop constitutional machinery, to insist on terms in return for a grant of money.
Because of wars, kings were allied with advanced capitalistic developments from the closing centuries of the Middle Ages.
The growing demands of governments in the extreme case of war tightened up the whole development of the state and produced the intensification of the idea of the state.
The Bank of England and the national debt emerge during a conflict between England and France, which almost turned into a financial war and brought finance into the very structure of government.
In the 17th century armies had been mounting in size, and the need for artillery and for vast numbers of uniforms had an important effect on the size of economic enterprises.


The popularity in England of the natural sciences was paralleled to a degree by an enthusiasm for antiquarian pursuits.
In the later decades of the 17th century the scientific method began to affect the development of historical study.
In turn, the preoccupation with the process of things in time seems to have had an influence upon scientists themselves.
Perhaps the presiding scientific achievement in the next hundred years was the application of biology, geology and allied studies to the construction of a history of the physical universe.
By the end of the period this branch of science had come almost to the edge of the Darwinian theory of evolution.
For the rest, if there was further scientific &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; in the 18th century, it was in the field of chemistry.
At the beginning of the period it had not been possible to isolate a gas or even to recognize clearly that different gases existed.
In the last quarter of the century Lavoisier reshaped this whole branch of science; water, which had been regarded for thousands of years as an element, was now seen to be a compound of oxygen and hydrogen.

By this time England&mdash;the nation of shopkeepers&mdash;was surprising the world with developments in the industrial field.
A class of men had emerged who were agile in intellect, capable of self-help and eager for novel enterprises.
They often lacked the classical education of the time, and were in a sense cut off from their cultural inheritance;
    and they no longer had the passion to intervene in theological controversy.
Science and craftsmanship, combined with the state of the market, enabled them,
    however, to indulge their zeal for gadgets, mechanical improvements and inventions.

A considerable minor literature of the time gives evidence of the widespread passion for the production of technical devices, a passion encouraged sometimes by the policy of the government.
Between 1760 and 1785 more patents were taken out than in the preceding 60 years;
    and of the estimated total of 26,000 patents;
    for the whole century, about half were crowded into the 15 years after 1785.
In 1761 the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, established a few years earlier, offered a prize for an invention that would enable six threads to be spun by a single pair of hands.
A few years later Hargreave&#39;s spinning jenny and Arkwright&#39;s water frame appeared.
The first steam engine had emerged at the beginning of the century, but textile factories began by using water power.
The change to steam both here and in the production of iron greatly intensified the industrial revolution that was to alter the landscape so profoundly in the 19th century. 


The country was able to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding population, especially as industrial development was accompanied by an agrarian revolution&mdash;the birth of something like modern farming.
Possibly as a result of a change in the prevalent type of rat, England ceased to suffer from the plague that had ravaged it for centuries.
Advances in public-health techniques helped reduce the death rate, especially among infants.
During the 18th century the English population rose from 5.5 to nine million.
And people flocked to swell the growing industrial towns, as though assured that they were fleeing from something worse to something better.


Even in 1700 most Englishmen were still engaged in occupations of a primary nature, connected with farming, fishing, mining and so on.
London had perhaps half a million inhabitants, but Bristol, which came next, may have had only 20,000.
Very few towns had a population exceeding 10,000.
Each country town had its miller, its brewer, its tanner and so on; each village had its baker, its blacksmith and its cobbler.
Many of the people who were employed in industry —in the making of textiles, for example&mdash;carried on the work in their own homes with hand looms and spinning wheels;
    they supplemented their income by farming.


The coming of the factory system and the growth of towns represented an unprecedented transformation of life and of the human environment, besides speeding up the rate of all future change.
This denser and more complicated world required more careful policing, more elaborate administration and a tremendous increase in the tasks of government.
The mere growth and distribution of population, and the fresh disposition of forces that it produced within society, are fundamental factors in the history of the 19th century.


With gathering momentum came railways, the use of electricity, the internal-combustion engine and today the world of electronics and nuclear weapons.
Science, so long an aid to the inventor, now seems itself to need the engineer and the industrial magnate.
And all the elaborate apparatus of this technical civilization is easily communicable to every quarter of the globe.
Our scientific-industrial revolution is a historical landmark for those peoples to whom Renaissance and Reformation have no relevance, since Christianity and Greek antiquity are not in their tradition.
The material apparatus of our civilization is more communicable to other continents than are our more subtle and imponderable ideas.


Yet the humanism that has its roots so far back in our history has by no means lost its hold on the world.
In the West, indeed, it now touches vastly wider classes of peoples than were able to read at all before the days of the industrial revolution.
That revolution requires the spread of education, and at the same time provides the apparatus for it.
The extraordinary speeding-up of communications and the increased mobility of life have themselves had colossal educative results.
It was under the ancient order that the peasantry were sometimes felt to be like cows;
    John Wesley, although he held so firmly that the lowest classes were redeemable, himself described them with astonishing frequency as wild beasts.
The new era has raised the stature of men, not lowered it, as some have imagined;
    and seems to require (or to produce) a more genuine kind of moral autonomy.


Great literature is perhaps more widely appreciated at the present day than ever in previous history.
The rights and freedoms of man and the independence and self-respect of nations have never been more glorified than in our own century.
And we have transmitted these ideals to other parts of the globe.
The scientific-industrial revolution has operated to a great saving of life.
At the same time it has provided a system which, where it has prevailed, has so far enabled the expanded population to live.

The vastness of populations and the character of the technical revolution itself have led, however, to certain dangers.
The development of high-powered organization means that a colossal machine can now be put at the service of a possible dictatorship.
It is not yet clear that the character of the resulting civilization will necessarily undermine the dictatorship and produce the re-establishment of what we call Western values.
In this sense the elaborate nature of the system may come to undermine that wonderful individualism that gave it its start.
At the same time, when nations are ranged against one another, each may feel forced to go on elaborating and enlarging ever more terrible weapons, though no nation wants them or ever in tends to use them.
Weapons may then defeat their own ends, and man may find himself the slave of the machine.

The Western ideal of democracy is older than the scientific-industrial revolution, but it may eventually prove a necessary concomitant of that revolution may spread.
At this point we simply do not know.
There are certain things we cannot achieve without tools.
But the tools in themselves do not necessarily determine our destiny.
