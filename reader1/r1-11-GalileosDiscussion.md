<span class="textsc">Galileo&#39;s discussion of projectile motion</span>
To this point we have been solely concerned with the motion of objects as characterized by their speed;
    we have not given much consideration to the direction of motion, or to changes in direction of motion.
Turning now to the more general problem of projectile motion,
    we leave the relatively simple case of bodies moving in a straight line only and expand our methods to deal with projectiles moving along curved paths.
Our understanding of this field will hinge largely on a far-reaching idea:
    the observed motion of a projectile may be thought of as the result of two separate motions,
    combined and occurring simultaneously;
    one component of motion is in a horizontal direction and without acceleration,
    whereas the other is in a vertical direction and has a constant acceleration downward in accordance with the laws of free fall.
Furthermore, these two components do not interfere with each other;
    each component may be studied as if the other were not present.
Thus the whole motion of the projectile at every moment is simply the result of the two individual actions.
This principle of the independency of the horizontal and vertical components of projectile motion was set forth by Galileo in his Dialogue on the great world systems (1632).
Although in this work he was principally concerned with astronomy, Galileo already knew that terrestrial mechanics offered the clue to a better understanding of planetary motions.
Like the Two new sciences, this earlier work is cast in the form of a discussion among the same three characters, and also uses the Socratic method of the Platonic dialogues.
Indeed, the portion of interest to us here begins with Salviati reiterating one of Socrates&#39; most famous phrases, as he tells the AristoteUan Simplicio that he, Simplicio, knows far more about mechanics than he is aware: [^1]

<blockquote>
    <em>Salviati:</em> &hellip; Yet I am so good a midwife of minds that I will make you confess the same whether you will or no.
    But Sagredus stands very quiet, and yet, if I mistake not, I saw him make some move as if to speak.

    <em>Sagredo:</em> I had intended to speak a fleeting something;
        but my curiosity aroused by your promising that you would force Simplicius to uncover the knowledge which he conceals from us has made me depose all other thoughts.
    Therefore I pray you to make good your vaunt.

    <em>Salviati:</em> Provided that Simplicius consents to reply to what I shall ask him, I will not fail to do it.

    <em>Simplicio:</em> I will answer what I know, assured that I shall not be much put to it,
        for, of those things which I hold to be false, I think nothing can be known,
        since Science concerns truths, not falsehoods.

    <em>Salviati:</em> I do not desire that you should say that you know anything,
        save that which you most assuredly know.
    Therefore, tell me; if you had here a flat surface as polished as a mirror and of a substance as hard as steel that was not horizontal but somewhat inclining, and you put upon it a perfectly spherical ball, say, of bronze, what do you think it would do when released?
    Do you not believe (as for my part I do) that it would lie still?
    <em>Simplicio:</em> If the surface were inclining?

    <em>Salviati:</em> Yes, as I have already stated.

    <em>Simplicio:</em> I cannot conceive how it should lie still.
    I am confident that it would move towards the declivity with much propenseness.

    <em>Salviati:</em> Take good heed what you say, Simplicius, for I am confident that it would lie still in whatever place you should lay it.

    <em>Simplicio:</em> So long as you make use of such suppositions, Salviatus, I shall cease to wonder if you conclude most absurd conclusions.

    <em>Salviati:</em> Are you assured, then, that it would freely move towards the declivity?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> Who doubts it?

    <em>Salviati:</em> And this you verily believe, not because I told you so (for I endeavored to persuade you to think the contrary), but of yourself, and upon your natural judgment?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> Now I see your game; you did not say this really believing it, but to try me, and to wrest words out of my mouth with which to condemn me.

    <em>Salviati:</em> You are right.
    And how long and with what velocity would that ball move?
    But take notice that I gave as the example a ball exactly round, and a plane exquisitely polished, so that all external and accidental impediments might be taken away.
    Also I would have you remove all obstructions caused by the air&#39;s resistance and any other causal obstacles, if any other there can be.

    <em>Simplicio:</em> I understand your meaning very well and answer that the ball would continue to move in infinitum if the inclination of the plane should last so long, accelerating continually.
    Such is the nature of ponderous bodies that they acquire strength in going, and, the greater the declivity, the greater the velocity will be.
</blockquote>

Simplicio is next led to express his belief that if he observed the ball rolling up the inclined plane he would know that it had been pushed or thrown, since it is moving contrary to its natural tendencies.
Then Salviati turns to the intermediate case:

<blockquote>
    <em>Salviati:</em> It seems, then, that hitherto you have well explained to me the accidents of a body on two different planes.
    Now tell me, what would befall the same body upon a surface that had neither acclivity nor declivity?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> Here you must give me a little time to consider my answer.
    There being no declivity, there can be no natural inclination to motion;
        and there being no acclivity, there can be no resistance to being moved.
    There would then arise an indifference between propulsion and resistance;
        therefore, I think it ought naturally stand still.
    But I had forgot myself; it was not long ago that Sagredus gave me to understand that it would do so.

    <em>Salviati:</em> So I think, provided one did lay it down gently;
        but, if it had an impetus directing it towards any part, what would follow?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> That it should move towards that part.

    <em>Salviati:</em> But with what kind of motion? Continually accelerated, as in declining planes; or successively retarded, as in those ascending?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> I cannot tell how to discover any cause of acceleration or retardation, there being no declivity or acclivity.

    <em>Salviati:</em> Well, if there be no cause of retardation, even less should there be any cause of rest.
    How long therefore would you have the body move?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> As long as that surface, neither inclined nor declined, shall last.

    <em>Salviati:</em> Therefore if such a space were interminate, the motion upon it would likewise have no termination, that is, would be perpetual.

    <em>Simplicio:</em> I think so, if the body is of a durable matter.

    <em>Salviati:</em> That has been already supposed when it was said that all external and accidental impediments were removed, and the brittleness of the body in this case is one of those accidental impediments.
    Tell me now, what do you think is the cause that that same ball moves spontaneously upon the inclining plane, and does not, except with violence, upon the plane sloping upwards?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> Because the tendency of heavy bodies is to move towards the center of the Earth and only by violence upwards towards the circumference.
    [This is the kernel of the Scholastic viewpoint on falling bodies (see Section 2.3).
    Salviati does not refute it, but turns it to Galileo&#39;s purposes.]

    <em>Salviati:</em> Therefore a surface which should be neither declining nor ascending ought in all its parts to be equally distant from the center.
    But is there any such surface in the world?

    <em>Simplicio:</em> There is no want of it, such is our terrestrial globe, for example, if it were not rough and mountainous.
    But you have that of the water, at such time as it is calm and still.
</blockquote>

Here is the genesis of one of the fundamental principles of the new mechanics:
    if all ``accidental&#39;&#39; interferences with an object&#39;s motion are removed, the motion will endure.
The ``accidents&#39;&#39; are eliminated in this thought experiment by:
    (1) proposing the use of a perfectly round, perfectly hard ball on a perfectly smooth surface, and
    (2) by imagining the surface to be a globe whose surface is everywhere equidistant from the center of the earth, so that the ball&#39;s "natural tendency" to go downward is balanced by the upward thrust of the surface.
(We shall return to this latter point in our discussion of isolated systems in Chapter 16.)
Note carefully the drastic change from the Scholastic view: instead of asking ``What makes the ball move?&#39;&#39; Galileo asks ``What might change its motion?&#39;&#39;

Having turned the conversation to smooth water, Galileo brings in the motion of a stone dropping from the mast of a moving ship.
Since the stone is moving horizontally with the ship before it is dropped, it should continue to move horizontally while it falls.

<figure id="fig3-1">
<figcaption>
    A stone dropped from the mast of a ship in uniform motion. 
    From the shore the trajectory of the stone is seen to be a curved line (parabola).
</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
    <em>Sagredo:</em> If it be true that the impetus with which the ship moves remains indeUbly impressed in the stone after it is let fall from the mast;
        and if it be further true that this motion brings no impediment or retardment to the motion directly downwards natural to the stone,
        then there ought to ensue an effect of a very wonderful nature.
    Suppose a ship stands still, and the time of the falling of a stone from the mast&#39;s round top to the deck is two beats of the pulse.
    Then afterwards have the ship under sail and let the same stone depart from the same place.
    According to what has been premised, it shall still take up the time of two pulses in its fall,
        in which time the ship will have gone, say, twenty yards.
    The true motion of the stone then will be a transverse line
        [i.e., a curved line in the vertical plane, see Fig. 3.1],
        considerably longer than the first straight and perpendicular line, the height of the mast,
        and yet nevertheless the stone will have passed it in the same time.
    Increase the ship&#39;s velocity as much as you will,
        the falling stone shall describe its transverse lines still longer and longer and yet shall pass them all in those selfsame two pulses.
    In this same fashion, if a cannon were leveled on the top of a tower, and fired point-blank,
        that is, horizontally, and whether the charge were small or large with the ball falling sometimes a thousand yards distant,
        sometimes four thousand, sometimes ten, etc.,
        all these shots shall come to ground in times equal to each other.
    And every one equal to the time that the ball would take to pass from the mouth of the piece to the ground,
        if, without other impulse, it falls simply downwards in a perpendicular line.
    Now it seems a very admirable thing that, in the same short time of its falling perpendicularly down to the ground from the height of,
        say, a hundred yards, equal balls, fired violently out of the piece,
        should be able to pass four hundred, a thousand, even ten thousand yards.
    All the balls in all the shots made horizontally remain in the air an equal time [Fig. 3.2].

    <em>Salviati:</em> The consideration is very elegant for its novelty and,
        if the effect be true, very admirable.
    Of its truth I make no question, and, were it not for the accidental impediment of the air,
        I verily believe that, if at the time of the ball&#39;s going out of the piece another were let fall from the same height directly downwards,
        they would both come to the ground at the same instant, though one should have traveled ten thousand yaids in its range,
        and another only a hundred, presupposing the surface of the Earth to be level.
    As for the impediment which might come from the air,
        it would consist in retarding the extreme swift motion of the shot.
