<blockquote>

Ye British Asses, who expect to hear
    Ever some new thing,

I&#39;ve nothing new to tell, but wliat, I fear,
    May be a true thing.

For Tait comes with his plummet and his line,
    Quick to detect your

Old bosh new dressed in what you call a tine
    Popuular lecture.



Whence comes that most peculiar smattering,
    Heard in our section?

Pure nonsense, to a scientific swing
    Drilled to perfection?

That small word &ldquo;Force,&rdquo; they make a barber&#39;s block,
    Ready to put on

Meanings most strange and various, tit to shock
    Pupils of Newton.



Ancient and foreign ignorance they tlirow
    Into the bargain;

The shade of Leibnitz mutters from below
    Horrible jargon.

The phrases of last century in this
    Linger to play tricks&mdash;

Vis Viva and Vis Mortua and Vis
    Acceleratrix:&mdash;



Those long-nebbed words that to our text books still
    Cling by their titles,

And from them creep, as entozoa will,
    Into our vitals.

But see! Tait writes in lucid symbols clear
    One small equation;

And Force becomes of Energy a mere
    Space-variation.

Force, then, is Force, but mark you! not a thing,
    Only a Vector;

Thy barb&eacute;d arrows now have lost their sting,
    Impotent spectre!

Thy reign, Force! is over. Now no more
    Heed we thine action;

Repulsion leaves us where we were before,
    So does attraction.



Both Action and Reaction now are gone.
    Just ere they vanished,

Stress joined their hands in peace, and made them one
    Then they were banished.

The Universe is free from pole to pole.
    Free from all forces.

Rejoice! ye stars&mdash;like blessed gods ye roll
    On in your courses.



No more the arrows of the Wrangler race,
    Piercing shall wound you.

Forces no more, those symbols of disgrace,
    Dare to surround you:

But those whose statements baffle all attacks,
    Safe by evasion,&mdash;


Whose definitions, like a nose of wax,
    Suit each occasion,&mdash;




Whose unreflected rainbow far surpassed
    All our inventions.

Whose very energy appears at last
    Scant of dimensions:&mdash;



Are these the gods in whom ye put your trust.
    Lordlings and ladies?

The hidden potency of cosmic dust
    Drives them to Hades.



While you, brave Tait! who know so well the way
    Forces to scatter,

Calmly await the slow but sure decay,
    Even of Matter.
