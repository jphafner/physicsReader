With the aid of a slow-motion movie camera and a co-operative friend any golf player can easily explore the dynamics of his club head during the split second of the drive that separates the sheep from the goats of golfdom.
The procedure, as applied by Louis A. Graham, a consulting engineer in Naples, Fla., analyzes the travel of the club head throughout the swing, including its velocity and acceleration at the critical moment of impact&mdash;factors that determine whether a squarely struck ball will merely topple off the tee or go a history-making 445 yards to match the performance of E. C. Bliss in August, 1913.

&ldquo;The procedure is essentially simple,&rdquo; writes Graham, &ldquo;but the reliability of the results will reflect the care with which certain measurements are made.
I pick a sunny day for the experiment and, having arrived at the golf course with my co-operative friend and accessories, tee my ball.
Then I place a tee marker precisely four feet in front of the ball and another four feet behind it to make a line that points toward the first green.
My friend stations the tripod mounted camera for a medium close-up shot on a line that intersects the ball at right angles to the tee markers.
I address the bail, facing the camera.
My friend photographs the complete drive from address to follow-through at the rate of 48 frames per second.
The known distance between the tee markers and their position in relation to the club head scales the pictures with respect to distance.
The exposure rate&mdash;the number of frames per second&mdash;of the camera provides the time dimension.
(If the exposure rate is not known accurately, it can be calibrated by photographing a phonograph turntable marked with a chalk line and turning at 45 or 78 revolutions per minute.)


&ldquo;The film is developed and analyzed.
One can use either a film-editing device that projects an enlarged image of each frame or a set of enlarged prints of each frame, mounted serially and numbered for identification.

&ldquo;The next step is to plot the position of the club head during the course of the swing.
Since a point in a plane is determined by its distance from two other known points, the position of the club head can be plotted in relation to that of the two tee markers [see illustration below].
First, I draw a base line near the bottom of a sheet of graph paper ruled with rectangular co-ordinates and on it locate three equally spaced points:
    the tee marker <i>P</i>, the ball (<i>O</i>) and the tee marker <i>Q</i>.
I usually space these points four inches apart, thus establishing a scale of 12 inches of club head travel per inch of graph paper.

&ldquo;The location of the club head (<i>C</i>) with respect to that of the tee markers can be transferred to the graph by one of three methods.
Proportional dividers are handy for transferring the scaled distance from <i>P</i> to <i>C</i> and from <i>C</i> to <i>Q</i>.
Alternatively, the angles <i>CPQ</i> and <i>CQP</i> can be measured with a protractor and reconstructed on the graph, point <i>C</i> being located at the intersection of lines projected from <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>.
If no protractor is at hand, the vertical and horizontal distances between <i>C</i>, <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> can be measured with a square and ruler and similarly transferred to the graph.

&ldquo;Plot enough points to establish a reasonably smooth track, skipping several frames during slow portions of the swing.
The resulting graph is of course not extremely accurate.
The plane in which the club head swings, for example, is inclined to the plane of the film.
The track plotted from the image therefore differs slightly from the true excursion of the club head, but the error is not large and can be ignored.
By the same token, the travel of the club head from point to point is subsequently measured along straight lines, whereas the club head actually follows a cursed path.
Error introduced by this source can be minimized by speeding up the camera.
My camera, an inexpensive one, is limited to a maximum speed of 48 frames per second, a rate that records the event adequately for the objectives of this experiment.

&ldquo;The total distance traveled by the club head and its velocity and acceleration are derived from a second set of graphs prepared from the graph of club head position.
On a second sheet of graph paper ruled with rectangular coordinates divide the abscissa into a series of uniform increments equal to the total number of frames occupied by the swing and note the corresponding time intervals in seconds as well as the frame numbers.
The ordinate will carry two scales: club head travel in feet and club head speed in miles per hour.
The scales of the ordinate should provide for a total club head travel of 36 feet and a maximum velocity of about 80 miles per hour.
Graphs of convenient proportion result when the length of the ordinate representing 36 feet equals the length representing one second on the abscissa.
The maximum velocity of 80 miles per hour need not occupy more than half of the ordinate scale, as shown in the accompanying graph [tipper illustration on page 94].

&ldquo;Data for plotting club head travel against time are derived by measuring the graph of club head position.
Make a table of three columns, for frame number, time and distance.
Beginning with the point on the graph of club head travel that shows the head addressing the ball, scale the distance to the next point and convert to equivalent feet by referring the measurement to the base line that includes <i>P</i>, <i>O</i> and <i>Q</i>.
Measure and tabulate the remaining position points in the same way.
When the table is complete, add the distance increments progressively, plot distance against time and draw a smooth curve through the points.

&ldquo;The speed of the club head at any point is found from this graph by the familiar graphical method of slopes.
To find the speed of the club head at about the point of impact (frame No. 43), draw a tangent <i>LKM</i> of arbitrary length through <i>K</i>.
The sides <i>MN</i> and <i>LN</i> are found by referring to the scale to equal 11.2 ft and 0.11 sec respectively.
The speed of the club head at this instant is equal to the ratio 11.2&#8725;0.11, or 102 ft&#8725;sec.
The result can be expressed in miles per hour by multiplying it by the number of seconds per hour and dividing the product by the number of feet per mile:
    102 &times; 3,600&#8725;5,280 = 70 miles per hour.
Repeat the procedure for each of the frames, tabulate the results, plot speed versus time and draw a smooth curve through the points.

&ldquo;Club head acceleration can be graphed in the same way or merely computed from the graph of club head speed at frames of particular interest, such as the frame showing the moment of impact.
For example, to determine the acceleration of the club head depicted by frame No. 38, draw a tangent to the graph at this point.
Then, at some arbitrary point above, say at the point corresponding to a velocity of 0.56 mile per hour, drop a perpendicular <i>MN</i> from the tangent.
At another arbitrary point below, say at the point corresponding to a velocity of 12 mile per hour, draw a line <i>LN</i> parallel to the abscissa and intersecting both the tangent and <i>MS</i>.
Inspection of the abscissa discloses that the length <i>LN</i> is analogous to a time interval of 0.1 second.
Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity and is equal to the difference between the final velocity and initial velocity divided by the time interval between the two.
In this example the velocity difference is 56 mile per hour minus 12 mile per hour, or, expressed in feet per second: 56&minus;12 &times; 5,280&#8725;3,600 = 64 feet per second.
The acceleration is 64&#8725;.1 = 640 feet per second.
The acceleration of gravity (<i>g</i>) amounts to 32 feet per second per second.
The acceleration of the club head at frame No. 38 in terms of <i>g</i> is accordingly 640&#8725;32, or 20 <i>g</i>!

&ldquo;Having performed this rainy-after-noon portion of the procedure, what reward awaits the duffer?
For one thing, he can see at a glance why his drives do not match those of a professional golfer.
The graphs discussed so far show the performance of golf professional Dick Bull using an iron.
His swing from address to follow-through required 1.17 seconds.
The club head traveled 31 feet.
His backswing occupied 0.6 second.
He paused at the top about 0.1 second.
More interesting than these figures, in my opinion, are those of the club head speed and acceleration Bull achieved: the increase in club head speed during the 0.1 second before impact from 15 miles per hour to an amazing 70 miles per hour, representing an acceleration of slightly over 20 <i>g</i>.
Graphs of Bull&#39;s performance with a driver, although different in many respects from those of his irons, show exactly the same figure for speed, 70 miles per hour, and an acceleration of 22 <i>g</i>, a remarkably uniform performance.
Similar analysis of the performance of a fairly good amateur using a driver shows precisely half the velocity of Bull&#39;s club, 35 miles per hour, and an acceleration at impact of only seven <i>g</i> [<em>see lower illustration below</em>].

&ldquo;Although these methods of analyzing motion are routine in engineering circles, I am not familiar with their prior application to the game of golf.
As with many procedures, they are easier to apply than to describe.
I find them interesting because they clearly reveal why Bull and other professionals achieve their long drives.
Duffers with movie cameras may well begin asking each other, &lsquo;How&#39;s your <i>v</i> and <i>g</i>?&rsquo; &rdquo;
