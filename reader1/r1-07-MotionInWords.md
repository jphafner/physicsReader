Man began describing movement with words long before there were physicists to reduce motion to laws.
Our age-old fascination with moving things is attested to by the astonishing number of words we have for motion.
We have all kinds of words for all kinds of movement: special words for going up, others for coming down; words for fast motion, words for slow motion.
A thing going up may rise, ascend, climb, or spring.
Going down again, it may fall or descend; sink, subside, or settle; dive or drop; plunge or plop; topple, totter, or merely droop.
It may twirl, whirl, turn and circle; rotate, gyrate; twist or spin; roll, revolve and wheel.
It may oscillate, vibrate, tremble and shake; tumble or toss, pitch or sway; flutter, jiggle, quiver, quake; or lurch, or wobble, or even palpitate.
All these words tell some motion, yet every one has its own character.
Some of them you use over and over in a single day.
Others you may merely recognize.
And still they are but a few of our words for motion.
There are special words for the motions of particular things.
Horses, for example, trot and gallop and canter while men run, or stride, or saunter.
Babies crawl and creep.
Tides ebb and flow, balls bounce, armies march.
Other words tell the quality of motion, words like swift or fleet, like calm and slow.

Writers draw vivid mental pictures for the reader with words alone.
Here is a poet&#39;s description of air flowing across a field on a hot day:

<blockquote>
  <p>There came a wind like a bugle:</p>
  <p>It quivered through the grass,</p>
  <p>and a green chill upon the heat so ominous did pass.</p>
  <footer>Emily Dickinson</footer>
</blockquote>

Or again, the motion of the sea caused by the gravitational attraction of the moon:

<blockquote>
  <p>The western tide crept up along the sand,</p>
  <p>and o&#39;er and o&#39;er the sand,</p>
  <p>and round and round the sand,</p>
  <p>as far as the eye could see.</p>
  <footer>Charles Kingsley, <em>The Sands of Dee</em></footer>
</blockquote>

Or, swans starting into flight:

<blockquote>
    <p>I saw &hellip; all suddenly mount</p>
    <p>and scatter wheeling in great </p>
    <p>broken rings upon their clamorous wings.</p>
    <footer>W. B. Yeats, <em>The Wild Swans at Coole</em></footer>
</blockquote>

Sometimes just a single sentence will convey the whole idea of motion:

<blockquote>
  Lightly stepped a yellow star to its lofty place
  Emily Dickinson
</blockquote>

Or, this description of a ship sailing:

<blockquote>
  </p>She walks the water like a thing of life</p>
  <footer>Byron, The Corsair</footer>
</blockquote>


How is it that these poets describe motion?
They recall to us what we have seen;
    they compare different things through simile and metaphor;
    they rely on the reader to share their own emotions, and they invite him to recreate an image of motion in his own mind.
The poet has his own precision which is not the scientist&#39;s precision Emily Dickinson well knew it was the grass, not the wind, that quivered, and that stars don&#39;t step.
Byron never saw a walking boat.
But this is irrelevant.
All of us can appreciate and enjoy their rich images and see that they are true to the nature of man&#39;s perception, if not to the nature of motion itself.

From time to time a physicist reading poetry will find a poem which describes something that he has learned to be of significance to his, the physicist&#39;s description.
Here is an example:

<blockquote>
  <p>A ball will bounce, but less and less.</p>
  <p>It&#39;s not a light-hearted thing,</p>
  <p>  resents its own resilience.</p>
  <p>Falling is what it loves, &hellip;</p>
  <footer>Richard Wilbur, <em>Juggler</em></footer>
</blockquote>

Relativity is implicit in this next example:

<blockquote>
  <p>The earth revolves with me, yet makes no motion.</p>
  <p>The stars pale silently in a coral sky.</p>
  <p>In a whistling void I stand before my mirror unconcerned, and tie my tie.</p>
  <footer>Conrad Aiken, <em>Morning Song of Senlin</em></footer>

The poet&#39;s description of motion is a rich, whole vision, filled with both his perceptions and his responses Yet complete as it is, the poetic description is far from the scientific one.
Indeed, when we compare them, it is easy to forget they deal with the same things.
Just how does the scientific view of motion differ?
And to what purpose?
Let&#39;s try to answer these questions by shifting slowly from the poet&#39;s description to the scientist&#39;s.
As a first step, read this excerpt from a biography of a physicist of the last century.
Lord Kelvin.
The biographer is trying to convey the electric quality of Kelvin&#39;s lectures to his University classes.&rdquo;
He describes a lecture on tops (referred to as gyrostats here):

<blockquote>
  <p>
  The vivacity and enthusiasm of the Professor at that time was very great.
  The animation of his countenance as he looked at a gyrostat spinning, standing on a knife edge on a glass plate in front of him, and leaning over so that its center of gravity was on one side of the point of.
  Support; the delight with which he showed that hurrying of the precessional motion caused the gyrostat to rise, and retarding the precessional motion caused the gyrostat to fall, so that the freedom to precess was the secret of its not falling;
    the immediate application of the study of the gyrostat to the explanation of the precession of the equinoxes, and illustration by a model &hellip;&mdash;all these delighted his hearers, and made the lecture memorable.
  </p>
  <footer>Andrew Gray, <em>Lord Kelvin, An Account of his Scientific Life and Work</em></footer>
</blockquote>

This paragraph by Gray deals with motion, but still it is more concerned with human responses&mdash;Kelvin&#39;s obvious pleasure in watching the top, and his student&#39;s evident delight in watching both Kelvin and Kelvin&#39;s top.
At the same time it says much about the top&#39;s movement, hints at the reasons behind it, and mentions how understanding the top has led to understanding the precession of the earth&#39;s axis in space.

Gray used some of the everyday words for motion: rise, fall, spin, hurry, retard.
But he used other words and other phrases, too&mdash;more technical, less familiar: precess, center of gravity, equinoxes.
Technical words are important for a scientific description of motion.
When the scientist has dissected a motion and laid out its components, the need for new terms enters, the need for words with more precise meanings, words not clothed with connotations of emotional response.
Still, the scientist never can (and never really wants to), lose the connotations of common words entirely.
For example, here is Lord Kelvin&#39;s attempt to define precession (see Fig. 1.10, in the sense that Gray used it:

<blockquote>
  <p>
  This we call positive precessional rotation.
  It is the case of a common spinning-top (peery), spinning on a very fine point which remains at rest in a hollow or hole bored by itself; not sleeping upright, nor nodding, but sweeping its axis round in a circular cone whose axis is vertical.
  </p> 
  <footer>William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and P. G. Tait, <em>Treatise on Natural Philosophy</em></footer>
</blockquote>

This definition is interesting in several ways.
For one thing, it seems strange today that Kelvin, a Scot, should feel the need to explain &ldquo;spinning-top&rdquo; by adding &ldquo;peery,&rdquo; an obscure word to most of us, but one that Kelvin evidently thought more colloquial.
Think for a moment of how Kelvin went about his definition.
He used the words of boys spinning tops for fun, who then, and still today, say a top sleeps when its axis is nearly straight up, and that it nods as it slows and finally falls.
He reminded his readers of something they all had seen and of the everyday words for it.
(He obviously assumed that most of his readers once played with tops.)
In fact, this is the best way to define new words&mdash;to remind the reader of something he knows already and with words he might use himself.
Having once given this definition Kelvin never returns to the picture he employed.
It is clear, though, that when he wrote, &ldquo;positive precessional rotation,&rdquo; he brought this image to his own mind, and that he expected his readers to do the same.

Of course, it is not necessary to use as many words as Kelvin did to define precession.
Another, more austere, and to some, more scientific definition is this:

<blockquote>
  <p>When the axis of the top travels round the vertical making a constant angle <span class="math">i</span> with it, the motion is called steady or precessional.</p>
  <footer>E. J. Routh, <em>Treatise on the Dynamics of a System of Rigid Bodies</em></footer>
</blockquote>

All that refers to direct, human experience is missing here.
The top is now just something with an axis, no longer a bright-painted toy spinning on the ground.
And it is not the top that moves, but its axis, an imagined line in space, and this line moves about another imagined line, the vertical.
There is no poetry here, only geometry.
This is an exact, precise, and economical definition, but it is abstract, and incomplete.
It does not describe what anyone watching a real top sees.
In fact, it is only a few abstractions from the real top&#39;s motion on which the physicist-definer has concentrated his attention.
