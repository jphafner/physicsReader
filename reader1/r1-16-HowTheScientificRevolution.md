<span class="textsc">In</span> order to get a bird&39;s-eye view of any century it is quite useful to imagine it as a stretch of country, or a landscape, which we are looking at from a great height, let us say from an aeroplane.
If we view the seventeenth century in this way we shall be struck immediately by the great contrast between the scenery and even the climate of its earlier and that of its later years.
At first we get mountain ranges, torrents, and all the picturesque interplay of alternating storm and brightness; then, further on, the land slopes down to a richly cultivated plain, broken for a while by outlying heights and spurs, but finally becoming level country, watered by broad rivers, adorned with parks and mansions, and fit up by steady sunshine.
The mountains connect backwards with the central medieval Alps, and the plain leads forwards with little break into our own times.
To drop the metaphor before it begins to be misleading, we may say that the seventeenth century was an age of transition, and although every century can be so described, the seventeenth deserves this label better than most, because it hes between the Middle Ages and the modem world.
It witnessed one of the greatest changes which have ever taken place in men&39;s ways of thinking about the world they five in.

I happen to be interested in literature, amongst other things, and when I turn to this century I cannot help noticing that it begins with Shakespeare and Donne, leads on to Milton, and ends with Dryden and Swift: that is to say, it begins with a literature full of passion, paradox, imagination, curiosity and complexity, and ends with one distinguished rather by clarity, precision, good sense and definiteness of statement.
The end of the century is the beginning of what has been called the Age of Prose and Reason, and we may say that by then the qualities necessary for good prose had got the upper hand over those which produce the greatest kinds of poetry.
But that is not all: we find the same sort of thing going on elsewhere.
Take architecture, for example; you all know the style of building called Elizabethan or Jacobean&mdash;it is quaint and fanciful, sometimes rugged in outline, and richly ornamented with carving and decoration in which Gothic and classical ingredients are often mixed up together.
Well, by the end of the century this has given place to the style of Christopher Wren and the so-called Queen Anne architects, which is plain, well proportioned, severe, and purely classical without Gothic trimmings.
And here there is an important point to notice: it is true that the seventeenth century begins with a blend of medieval and modem elements, and ends with the triumph of the modem; but observe that in those days to be &lsquo;modem&rsquo; often meant to be &lsquo;classical&rsquo;, that is, to imitate the Greeks and Romans.
We call the age of Dryden, Pope and Addison the &lsquo;Augustan&rsquo; Age, and the men of that time really felt that they were living in an epoch like that of the Emperor Augustus&mdash;an age of enlightenment, learning and true civilisation&mdash;and congratulated themselves on having escaped from the errors and superstitions of the dark and monkish Middle Ages.
To write and build and think like the ancients meant that you were reasonable beings, cultivated and urbane&mdash;that you had abandoned the shadow of the cloister for the cheerful light of the market place or the coffee house.
If you were a scientist (or &lsquo;natural philosopher&rsquo;) you had to begin, it is true, by rejecting many ancient theories, particularly those of Aristotle, but you knew all the while that by thinking independently and taking nothing on trust you were following the ancients in spirit though not in letter.

Or let us glance briefly at two other spheres of interest: politics and religion, beginning with politics.
Here again you notice that the century begins with Cavalier and Roundhead and ends with Tory and Whig&mdash;that is to say, it begins with a division arousing the deepest passions and prejudices, not to be settled without bloodshed, and ends with the mere opposition of two political parties, differing in principle of course, but socially at one, and more ready to alternate peaceably with each other.
The Hanoverians succeed the Stuarts, and what more need be said?
The divine right of kings is little more heard of, and the scene is set for prosaic but peaceful development.
Similarly in religion, the period opens with the long and bitter struggle between Puritan and Anglican, continuing through civil war, and accompanied by fanaticism, persecution and exile, and by the multiplication of hostile sects; it ends with the Toleration Act, and with the comparatively mild dispute between the Deists and their opponents as to whether Nature was not after all a clearer evidence of God than Scripture, and the conscience a safer guide than the creeds.
In short, wherever you turn you find the same tale repeated in varying forms: the ghosts of history are being laid; darkness and tempest are yielding to the light of common day.
Major issues have been settled or shelved, and men begin to think more about how to live together in concord and prosperity.

Merely to glance at this historical landscape is enough to make one seek some explanation of these changes.
If the developments had conflicted with each other we might have put them down to a number of different causes, but since they all seem to be setting in one direction it is natural to suppose that they were all due to one common underlying cause.
There are various ways of accounting for historical changes: some people believe, for instance, that economic causes are at the bottom of everything, and that the way men earn their living, and the way in which wealth is produced and distributed, determine how men think and write and worship. Others believe that ideas, rather than material conditions, are what control history, and that the important question to ask about any period is what men then believed to be true, what their philosophy and religion were like.
There is something to be said on both sides, but we are concerned with a simpler question.
We know that the greatest intellectual change in modem history was completed during the seventeenth century: was that change of such a kind as to explain all those parallel movements we have mentioned?
Would it have helped or hindered that drift towards prose and reason, towards classicism, enlightenment and toleration?
The great intellectual change was that known as the Scientific Revolution, and I think the answer to these questions is&mdash;Yes. 

It is not for me to describe that revolution, or to discuss the great discoveries which produced it.
My task is only to consider some of the effects it had upon men&39;s thoughts, imaginations and feelings, and consequently upon their ways of expressing themselves.
The discoveries&mdash;I am thinking mainly of the Copernican astronomy and the laws of motion as explored by Galileo and fully formulated by Newton&mdash;shocked men into realising that things were not as they had always seemed, and that the world they were living in was really quite different from what they had been taught to suppose.
When the crystal spheres of the old world-picture were shattered, and the earth was shown to be one of many planets rolling through space, it was not everyone who greeted this revelation with enthusiasm as Giordano Bruno did.
Many felt lost and confused, because the old picture had not only seemed obviously true to common sense, but was confirmed by Scripture and by Aristotle, and hallowed by the age-long approval of the Church.
What Matthew Arnold said about the situation in the nineteenth century applies also to the seventeenth: religion had attached its emotion to certain supposed facts, and now the facts were failing it.
You can hear this note of loss in Donne&39;s well-known lines:

<blockquote>
And new philosophy calls all in doubt;

The element of fire is quite put out;

The sun is lost, and th&39; earth, and no man&39;s wit

Can well direct him where to look for it.
</blockquote>

Not only &lsquo;the element of fire&rsquo;, but the very distinction between heaven and earth had vanished&mdash;the distinction, I mean, between the perfect and incorruptible celestial bodies from the moon upwards, and the imperfect and corruptible terrestrial bodies below it.
New stars had appeared, which showed that the heavens could change, and the telescope revealed irregularities in the moon&39;s surface&mdash;that is, the moon was not a perfect sphere, as a celestial body should be.
So Sir Thomas Browne could write:

<blockquote>
    &lsquo;While we look for incorruption in the heavens, we find they are but like the earth;&mdash;durable in their main bodies, alterable in their parts; whereof, besides comets and new stars, perspectives (i.e. telescopes) begin to tell tales, and the spots that wander about the sun, with Phaeton&39;s favour, would make clear conviction.&rsquo;
</blockquote>

Naturally it took a long time for these new ideas to sink in, and Milton still treats the old and the new astronomies as equally acceptable alternatives.
The Copernican scheme, however, was generally accepted by the second half of the century.
By that time the laws governing the motion of bodies on earth had also been discovered, and finally it was revealed by Newton that the law whereby an apple falls to the ground is the very same as that which keeps the planets in their courses.
The realisation of this vast unifying idea meant a complete re-focusing of men&39;s ideas about God, Nature and Man, and the relationships between them.
The whole cosmic movement, in the heavens and on earth, must now be ascribed no longer to a divine pressure acting through the Primum Mobile, and angelic intelligences controlling the spheres, but to a gravitational pull which could be mathematically calculated.
The universe turned out to be a Great Machine, made up of material parts which all moved through space and time according to the strictest rules of mechanical causation.
That is to say, since every effect in nature had a physical cause, no room or need was left for supernatural agencies, whether divine or diabolical; every phenomenon was explicable in terms of matter and motion, and could be mathematically accounted for or predicted. As Sir James Jeans has said:
&lsquo;Only after much study did the great principle of causation emerge.
In time it was found to dominate the whole of inanimate nature &hellip;
The final establishment of this law &hellip;
was the triumph of the seventeenth century, the great century of Galileo and Newton.&rsquo;
It is true that mathematical physics had not yet conquered every field: even chemistry was not yet reduced to exactitude, and still less biology and psychology.
But Newton said: &lsquo;Would that the rest of the phenomena of nature could be deduced by a like kind of reasoning from mechanical principles&rsquo;&mdash;and he believed that they could and would.

I referred just now to some of the immediate effects of the &lsquo;New Philosophy&rsquo; (as it was called); let me conclude by hinting at a few of its ultimate effects.
First, it produced a distrust of all tradition, a determination to accept nothing as true merely on authority, but only after experiment and verification.
You find Bacon rejecting the philosophy of the medieval Schoolmen, Browne writing a long exposure of popular errors and superstitions (such as the belief that a toad had a jewel in its head, or that an elephant had no joints in its legs), Descartes resolving to doubt everything&mdash;even his own senses&mdash;until he can come upon something clear and certain, which he finally finds in the fact of his own existence as a thinking being.
Thus the chief intellectual task of the seventeenth century became the winnowing of truth from error, fact from fiction or fable.
Gradually a sense of confidence, and even exhilaration, set in; the universe seemed no longer mysterious or frightening; everything in it was explicable and comprehensible.
Comets and eclipses were no longer dreaded as portents of disaster; witchcraft was dismissed as an old wives&39; tale.
This new feeling of security is expressed in Pope&39;s epitaph on Newton:

<blockquote>
Nature and Nature&39;s laws lay hid in night;

God said, Let Newton be! and all was light!
</blockquote>

How did all this affect men&39;s religious beliefs?
The effect was very different from that of Darwinism on nineteenth century religion.
In the seventeenth century it was felt that science had produced a conclusive demonstration of God, by showing the evidence of His wisdom and power in the Creation.
True, God came to be thought of rather as an abstract First Cause than as the personal, ever-present God of religion; the Great Machine implied the Great Mechanic, but after making the machine and setting it in motion God had, as it were, retired from active superintendence, and left it to run by its own laws without interference.
But at a time when inherited religious sentiment was still very powerful, the idea that you could look up through Nature to Nature&39;s God seemed to offer an escape from one of the worst legacies of the past&mdash;religious controversy and sectarian intolerance.
Religion had been endangered by inner conflict; what could one believe, when the Churches were all at daggers drawn?
Besides, the secular and rational temper brought in by the new science soon began to undermine the traditional foundations of belief.
If nothing had ever happened which could not be explained by natural, physical causes, what about the supernatural and miraculous events recorded in the Bible?
This was a disturbing thought, and even in the seventeenth century there were a few who began to doubt the literal truth of some of the biblical narratives.
But it was reserved for the eighteenth century to make an open attack upon the miraculous elements in Christianity, and to compare the Old Testament Jehovah disparagingly with the &lsquo;Supreme Being&rsquo; or &lsquo;First Cause&rsquo; of philosophy.
For the time, it was possible to feel that science was pious, because it was simply engaged in studying God&39;s own handiwork, and because whatever it disclosed seemed a further proof of His almighty skill as designer of the universe.
Addison exactly expressed this feeling when he wrote:

<blockquote>
The spacious firmament on high.

With all the blue ethereal sky,

And spangled heavens, a shining frame.

Their great Original proclaim.

Th&39; unwearied Sun from day to day

Does his Creator&39;s power display;

And publishes to every land

The work of an Almighty hand.
</blockquote>

Science also gave direct access to God, whereas Church and creed involved you in endless uncertainties and difficulties.
However, some problems and doubts arose to disturb the prevailing optimism.
If the universe was a material mechanism, how could Man be fitted into it?&mdash;Man, who had always been supposed to have a free will and an immortal soul?
Could it be that those were illusions after all?
Not many faced up to this, though Hobbes did say that the soul was only a function of the body, and denied the freedom of the will.
What was more immediately serious, especially for poetry and religion, was the new tendency to discount all the products of the imagination, and all spiritual insight, as false or fictitious.
Everything that was real could be described by mathematical physics as matter in motion, and whatever could not be so described was either unreal or else had not yet been truly explained.
Poets and priests had deceived us long enough with vain imaginings; it was now time for the scientists and philosophers to take over, and speak to us, as Sprat says the Royal Society required its members to do, in a &lsquo;naked, natural&rsquo; style, bringing all things as close as possible to the &lsquo;mathematical plainness&rsquo;.
Poets might rave, and priests might try to mystify us, but sensible men would ignore them, preferring good sense, and sober, prosaic demonstration.
It was said at the time that philosophy (which then included what we call science) had cut the throat of poetry.
This does not mean that no more good poetry could then be produced: after all.
Dryden and Pope were both excellent poets.
But when all has been said they do lack visionary power: their merits are those of their age&mdash;sense, wit, brilliance, incisiveness and point.
It is worth noticing that when the Romantic movement began a hundred years later, several of the leading poets attacked science for having killed the universe and turned man into a reasoning machine.
But no such thoughts worried the men of the Augustan Age; their prevailing feeling was satisfaction at living in a world that was rational through and through, a world that had been explained favourably, explained piously, and explained by an Englishman.
The modem belief in progress takes its rise at this time; formerly it had been thought that perfection lay in antiquity, and that subsequent history was one long decline.
But now that Bacon, Boyle, Newton and Locke had arisen, who could deny that the ancients had been far surpassed?
Man could now hope to control his environment as never before, and who could say what triumphs might not lie ahead?
Even if we feel that the victory of science was then won at the expense of some of man&39;s finer faculties, we can freely admit that it brought with it many good gifts as well&mdash;tolerance, reasonableness, release from fear and superstition—and we can pardon, and even envy, that age for its temporary self-satisfaction.
