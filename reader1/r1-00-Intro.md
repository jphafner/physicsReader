This is not a physics textbook.
Rather, it is a physics reader, a collection of some of the best articles and book passages on physics.
A few are on historic events in science, others contain some particularly memorable description of what physicists do; still others deal with philosophy of science, or with impact of scientific though on the imagination of the artist.

These are old and new classiscs, and also some little-known publications; many have been suggested for inclusion because some teacher or physicist remembered an article with particular fondness.
The majority of articles is not drawn from scientific papers of historic importance themselves, because material from many of these is readily available, either as quotation in the Project Physics text or in special collections.

This collection is meant for your browsing.
If you follow your own reading interests, chances are good that you will find here many pages that convey the joy these authors have in their work and the excitement of their ideas.
If you want to follow up on interesting excerpts, the source list at the end of the reader will guide you for further reading.
