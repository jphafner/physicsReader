author: Lee A. DuBridge
exerpt: This after-dinner address to the American Physical Society attempts to point up in a simplified way the amusing, as well as some of the more serious, problems which arise in connection with flight into space, including the Impracticality of using the moon as a military base or of solving the population problem by colonizing the planets.
intro: An article from <em>The American Journal of Physics</em>, 1960.

<span class="textsc">A wonderful</span> thing has happened during the past three years.
A new subject has been opened up which even an old-fashioned physicist can understand.
A new subject that involves no relativity corrections, no strangeparticle theory&mdash;not even any Fermi statistics.
Just good old-fashioned Newtonian mechanics!

Space!

All you have to do is get an object a couple of hundred miles above the earth and give it a horizontal speed of 5 or 10 miles/sec, and from that time on you can tell exactly what&#39;s going to happen to it&mdash;maybe even for a billion years&mdash;by just using Newton&#39;s laws of motion and his law of gravitation.
The mathematical details get a little rough now and then, but a good IBM machine will take care of that&mdash;if you can find someone who knows how to use it.
But there is nothing in principle that any physicist can&#39;t understand.

I personally prefer to talk about space to nonscientific audiences.
In the first place, they can&#39;t check up on whether what you are saying is right or not.
And, in the second place, they can&#39;t make head or tail out of what you are telling them anyway&mdash;so they just gasp with surprise and wonderment, and give you a big hand for being smart enough to say such incomprehensible things.
And I never let on that all you have to do to work the whole thing out is to set the centrifugal force equal to the gravitational force and solve for the velocity.
That&#39;s all there is to it!
Knowing <var>v</var>, you can find the period of motion, of course, and that&#39;s practically all you need. [^1]

To show what I mean, let me give a simple example that I heard discussed at an IRE meeting a couple of years ago.

Imagine two spacecraft buzzing along in the same circular orbit around the earth&mdash;say 400 miles up&mdash;and one ship is 100 yards or so ahead of the other one.
The fellow in the rear vehicle wants to throw a baseball or a monkey wrench or a ham sandwich, or something, to the fellow ahead of him.
How does he do it?

It sounds real easy.
Since the two ships are in the same orbit, they must be going at the same speed&mdash;so the man in the rear could give the baseball a good throw forward and the fellow ahead should catch it.

But wait!
When you throw the ball out, its speed is added to the speed of the vehicle so now it is going too fast for that orbit.
The centrifugal force is too great and the ball goes off on a tangent and rises to a higher orbit.
But an object in a higher orbit must go slower.
In fact, the faster he throws the ball, the higher it rises and the slower it goes.
So our baseball pitcher stares in bewilderment as the ball rises ahead of him, then seems to stop, go back over his head, and recede slowly but surely to the rear, captured forever in a higher and slower and more elliptical orbit while the pitcher sails on his original course.

You must make a correction, of course, if you assume the ball&#39;s mass is not negligible and you take account of the conservation of momentum.
Then, as the ball is pitched forward, the vehicle is slowed down&mdash;whereupon it falls into a lower orbit where, of course, it goes faster.
So in this case the ball appears to rise higher and fall behind faster.

But now our ball thrower decides to try again.
This time he is going to be smart.
If you can&#39;t reach the guy ahead by throwing forward, the obvious thing to do is throw the ball to the rear.
Now its speed is subtracted from that of the vehicle;
    hence it is going too slow for its orbit;
    hence it falls to a lower orbit and goes faster, passes underneath the rear vehicle, moves forward and passes underneath the forward vehicle, and then on into its orbit.
It will be left as an exercise for the student to determine just how the baseball may be launched in order to hit the forward vehicle.
One way, of course, is to first circle the earth and come back on the second lap, but there are other ways.

Now, that&#39;s all very simple Newtonian mechanics, of course.
But you can see how, when you start to explain that to make an object go faster you slow it down and to make it go slower you speed it up, people begin to think you are either crazy or very smart.
However, tonight I am talking to physicists and they are used to far crazier things than that&mdash;so they will have no trouble believing me at all.

So let&#39;s get on with more serious problems.

For example, last summer there appeared in a military journal an article on the use of the moon as a military base.
This article is an inexhaustible source of fascinating problems for your students.

The first point made by the writer is that military men have always cherished &ldquo;high ground.&rdquo;
First a hill or a mountain, then a balloon, then an airplane, then a higher airplane, then a ballistic missile, and now&mdash;what could be more logical&mdash;the moon.
Next, of course (though the author fails to mention this), comes Venus, then Mars, then Mercury, then the sun Eventually, of course, we&#39;d like to get out to Alpha Centauri (the nearest large star).
But at the speeds of present space ships it would take 100,000 years or so to get to Alpha Centauri. And, who knows, the war might be over by then.

But let&#39;s stick to the moon.
Our article suggests it&#39;s a real interesting possibility to hit an enemy target from the moon.
The author does not mention that it would be a lot quicker, cheaper, and easier to hit it from Iowa, or Alaska, or Maine.
But the moon is higher&mdash;and so is less vulnerable.
Besides&mdash;here is the clincher&mdash;the velocity of escape from the moon is only 1.5 mile per second, while the initial velocity of an ICBM is nearly 5 mile per second.
Think of all the fuel you save!
Of course, there is a little matter of getting the rocket and fuel up to the moon in the first place.
But that presumably will be charged to the Military Air Transport Service and so can be neglected.

Now you can easily prove that if you fired a rocket from the moon at just over 1.5 mile per second, and did it just right, you could put it into an elliptical earth orbit which would intersect the earth&#39;s surface after a flight time of about five days.
And, if you timed it just right and the earth kept spinning at just the right speed, your target might rotate into position under the point of entry just as the rocket came in.
But if you made an error of a few percent in the velocity and the flight took only 4&#189;<!--vulgar 1/2--> days&mdash;then maybe New York would appear at the point of impact, or maybe the middle of the Pacific Ocean, or, more likely, the ellipse might miss the earth&#39;s surface entirely and the object return to its starting point.
Except, the starting point, the moon&mdash;now, 10 days later&mdash;won&#39;t be there anymore!
The moon will be a third of the way around its orbit!

It is, of course, very unimaginative of me not to recognize that you could shoot the rocket faster than 1.5 mile per second and get the payload to the earth faster than five days.
So you could.
That takes more fuel of course&mdash;and soon you will wonder why you didn&#39;t stay home in the first place.
But, the article says, you could reduce the flight time from moon to earth to a few minutes if you wished.
Again, so you could.
All you need to do is to accelerate to an average speed of a million miles per hour.
That&#39;s 275 mile per second.
That&#39;s 55 times as fast as an earthbound ICBM, or 3000 times as much kinetic energy.
So, if the ICBM takes 100,000 pounds of fuel, to launch our rocket from the moon will take 5.5 million pounds.
And that&#39;s quite a load to get off the earth and up to the moon in the first place.
In fact, you&#39;ll burn up one billion pounds of fuel just lifting it off the earth.

Well, you begin to see why space research is so much fun.
And I think it&#39;s wonderful to have something turn up again that&#39;s fun.
We always used to say that we went into physics just because it was fun.
But then, with big machines and big crews and big budgets, physics research got deadly serious.
I have a physicist friend who is thinking of going into biology where all he needs is a microscope and some viruses&mdash;and he can have a lot of fun.
But I think space may save him for physics because that&#39;s fun too&mdash;especially if you&#39;re a theoretical physicist, as he is.
As long as you don&#39;t have to go up into space, but can just think about it, it is a lot of fun.

There is another bundle of space problems that can be a source of considerable amusement.
Have you ever tried to explain to your wife why it is that if she were in a space capsule in an orbit around the earth she would have lost all her weight.
Now the idea of losing a few pounds of weight might appeal to her, but I am sure the notion of weightlessness is something incomprehensible to most people.
If you ask most laymen why the condition of weightlessness exists, they would tell you that since you are above the earth&#39;s atmosphere there isn&#39;t any gravity and so, of course, you must be weightless.
To such people one must carefully explain that the force of gravity 200 miles above the surface of the earth is only 10 percent less than it is on the earth&#39;s surface.
Even at 4,000 miles the gravity is reduced only to one-quarter of its value on the earth&#39;s surface; and at 8,000 miles, to one-ninth.
Since it is obviously gravity that holds a satellite in a circular orbit, and since the earth&#39;s gravity is even strong enough out at the distance of the moon&mdash;240,000 miles&mdash;to hold the moon in its orbit, the weightlessness in an earth satellite is evidently not caused by the absence of gravity.
Then what is it caused by?
Of course, if you want to be a real coward, you will choose the easy way out and simply say that in a circular orbit the force of gravity is canceled by the centrifugal force, and the condition of weightlessness results.
You know very well, of course, that that isn&#39;t the proper explanation.
The centrifugal force is the force that the satellite exerts on the earth and is not a force on the satellite.
The force on the satellite is toward the earth and, indeed, it is the force of gravity which supplies the centripetal force which keeps the satellite in its orbit.
In other words, gravity and centripetal force are in the same direction, not opposite.
So, when this is pointed out by some unkind person, you get more sophisticated and say simply, &ldquo;Well, in any freely falling object the condition of weightlessness exists.
It would exist, for example, for passengers in a freely falling elevator.&rdquo;
But, since not many people have been passengers in a freely falling elevator, this explanation usually falls fairly flat also.
At this point I recommend that the argument be abandoned and we retreat into technical jargon by saying, &ldquo;Well, it&#39;s just one of Newton&#39;s laws of motion that whenever the inertial reaction and the accelerating force are equal, no tendency toward further acceleration can exist, and hence the system behaves as though no gravitational field were present.&rdquo;
No one can quarrel with that statement.
Even if nobody understands it, it&#39;s true.
And it even holds for an elliptical orbit where centrifugal force and gravity are not always equal, but weightlessness exists anyway.

By this time I suppose you will all be convinced that I am against space.
However, that&#39;s not true.
The Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory has a 50-million-dollar-a-year contract to do space research.
I would not dare be against it!

I seriously believe that when all the popular nonsense on space is swept away, we can soberly recognize that the achievement of getting manmade vehicles into space orbits and having them transmit scientific information back to earth is one of the great triumphs in the history of technology.
And, as so often happens when a new technological development occurs, new types of scientific exploration become possible.

I don&#39;t know much about the military value of space weapons.
And the little I do know does not impress me.
Nor do I know much about the psychological value of space ventures&mdash;how all the people in Asia and Africa think the greatest nation on earth is the one that puts up the heaviest satellite.
That doesn&#39;t impress me either.
But the possibilities of doing scientific experiments in space vehicles is something I can get really excited about.

Look at the very first thing that happened&mdash;the discovery of the Van Allen layers of charged particles.
Think of the many exciting experiments still ahead to unravel the mysteries which that discovery opened up.
And it&#39;s only the start.
Now at last we can explore the earth&#39;s gravitational, magnetic, and electric fields;
    look down on its storm patterns; determine the nature of highly rarefied matter in the space through which the earth moves, the radiation fields present throughout space.
We can now look, unimpeded, at the sun, the planets, and the stars&mdash;and a new era in astronomy is in the offing.
We&#39;ll be able to examine the moon directly with instruments landed on its surface&mdash;and clear up many mysteries about the origin of the solar system.
We&#39;ll discover some new mysteries too, no doubt.
Mars and Venus, and eventually other planets, will soon be in the range of direct examination, too.
We may actually live to see the day when we will know for sure whether the green patches on Mars are living plants or not&mdash;and, if so, whether they consist of the same type of organic molecules with which we are familiar on earth.

One of the most astonishing developments&mdash;to me at least&mdash;is that of the art of radio communication which makes it possible to transmit information over millions of miles of space.
Pioneer V is being heard over 5 million miles away with only 5 watts of power.
Its 150 watts transmitter should be heard out to 50 million miles&mdash;possibly to 100 million if we get some sensitive new receivers going in time.
Clearly, objects within a distance equal to the diameter of the earth&#39;s orbit can soon be listened to&mdash;out to a quarter of a billion miles perhaps.
I wonder what we can do beyond that!
The inverse-square law is a pretty imposing barrier.
But the ingenuity of the electronic engineer is beyond calculation.
(Incidentally, as an old-time worker in the field of photoelectricity, I take especial pleasure in watching the development of the solar cell.
Without it we would be in real trouble.
However, when Professor Hughes and I wrote our book on <em>Photoelectric Phenomena</em>, I regarded the photovoltaic cell as such a boring subject that I was glad to let him write that chapter. Solar cells flying in space did not occur to us as being an imminent necessity in 1931.)

One of the most fascinating aspects of the space age is that it has given birth to a new science&mdash;<em>space science</em>.
The only trouble is that no one is very clear about what space science is.
Is it the study of the contents of space itself?
If so, do we mean the space between the stars?
The space between the planets?
The space between the meteorites?
The space between the hydrogen atoms?
Or do we include everything?
If we mean everything&mdash;then all the astronomers have been space scientists for 2,000 years.
And, if I judge correctly, many astronomers are a little disgusted with all the Johnny-come-latelys [^2] who act as though they had <em>discovered</em> space&mdash;or even invented it.
Or is space science the science you do with instruments that are in space?
Thus, when you take pictures of the earth&#39;s clouds from a satellite, is that space science?
Or is it still meteorology?
When you are interested in the structure of the planet earth, you are a geologist.
If you are interested in the moon, you are a <em>selenologist</em> (after Selene, the moon goddess).
Is a selenologist a space scientist?
Then why not a geologist too?
If you are interested in Venus, then you have to look up the Greek word for Venus to find out what you are.
And, since the Greek word for Venus is &ldquo;Aphrodite,&rdquo; I still don&#39;t know what to call a Venusian geologist.
Maybe &ldquo;space science&rdquo; isn&#39;t such a bad term after all!

All I hope is that we don&#39;t let the glamour of the term &ldquo;space science&rdquo; confuse us.
There is a lot we can learn about the moon, for example, by just using lowly earthbound astronomical telescopes.
Let&#39;s not be seduced into sending expeditions to the moon just to look for things we can see perfectly well from Palomar Mountain&mdash;or from Kitt Peak or Mt. Hamilton.

Professor Bolton and Mr. Roberts and Mr. Radhakrishnan, of the Caltech Radio Astronomy Observatory, in just a few nights observing recently found that the radio radiation from Jupiter is partially polarized and that the polarized part appears to come from a belt which is separated from the planet&#39;s disk.
In other words, they have probably observed synchrotron radiation from a Van Allen belt around Jupiter.
That&#39;s space science for you&mdash;and achieved in a California desert at a cost far less than the cost of even a <em>very small</em> rocket!

On the other hand, the Pioneer V package has measured the earth&#39;s magnetic field out to nearly a million miles.
Preliminary analysis shows that it appears to be a pretty good dipole field out to 35,000 kilometer, but beyond that shows small perturbations not yet analyzed.
Here, clearly, is space science at its best&mdash;obtaining information available in no other way.
Pioneer V is also observing charged-particle radiation far away from the earth&#39;s magnetic field&mdash;and has observed fluctuations which are correlated with disturbances on the sun.
And, of course.
Pioneer V is at last obtaining data on the real primary cosmic radiation.
We have heard some excellent papers on space physics at this very meeting of the American Physical Society.

At last I believe the American people are beginning to realize that <em>these</em> are the real purposes of space research&mdash;to obtain scientific information.
At last they are asking not just whether our satellites weigh more than the Russians&#39;, but whether they provide us with more information.
We can be thankful that NASA did not yield to hysterical demands to perform useless stunts in space just to rival the Russians, but insisted on laying out a long-term program of space research.
It&#39;s going to be a slow program and an expensive one.
But, in the long run, solid scientific achievements will provide more national prestige than useless tricks.
I believe even the Mercury man-in-space program, in spite of all the nauseating journalistic publicity about the astronauts, has now been converted into a needed research program to study biological problems which must be understood by the time sending men into space becomes a really useful scientific venture.
Speaking of men in space, I am reminded of the recent television program on the population explosion in which a British economist calmly announced that rising population on earth would be no problem&mdash;we&#39;ll just ship the excess off into space!
Now there is a concept to provide real merriment for your space discussions.
I am told that excess population is piling up on earth at the rate of 45,000,000 people per year, or 123,000 per day.
What a passenger business that&#39;s going to be!
The first colony will be on the moon, I suppose. But who is going to lay the pipeline to get oxygen up to them?
And water?
And what about food?
And space suits?
With a few million people on the moon, I wonder how many space suits will get punctured every day.
(A punctured space suit in a perfect vacuum is a most unpleasant accident.)


Every day!
That reminds me&mdash;a day on the moon is 28 earth-days long.
Sunshine for 336 hours, then darkness for 336 hours.
A sizzling temperature of 220 &deg;F by day and minus 220&deg; at night.
In view of all the trouble, I propose instead that we build a huge floating platform all over the Pacific Ocean and put our excess population there.
It would have just as much area as the moon.
And, if we include the rest of the oceans, it would have as much as Mars too.
And it would be a lot cheaper.
And at least the people would have air to breathe!

Then we can save the moon for the people who ought to be there&mdash;physicists, chemists, biologists, geologists, and astronomers.
Then, I think the moon might be an interesting place to visit!

Please forgive me for making jokes about a serious subject.
My only hope is that by laughing at ourselves a little bit we may get back our sense of perspective.
And a sense of perspective is important, no matter what problem we are dealing with.
