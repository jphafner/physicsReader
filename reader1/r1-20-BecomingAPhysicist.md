title: Becoming a Physicist
author: Anne Roe
exerpt: In this chapter from her book <em>The Making of a Scientist</em>, Anne Roe, on eminent clinical psychologist, reports on her interviews with several men who became physicists.
    As these scientists individually describe their family backgrounds, the interests and activities of their youth, and their education, it becomes clear that there is no single pattern.
intro: An excerpt from her book <em>The Making of a Scientist</em>. 1952.

Here are the stories of several of the men who became physicists.
Since the theorists and experimentalists are quite unlike in some ways,
    I shall include both.
Again it is true that some of them knew quite early that the physical sciences were a vocational possibility,
    and others did not hear of them in such a connection until well along in school.
You can know that there is a school subject called physics,
    and men who teach it,
    and you probably will have learned that there have been famous men called physicists,
    who found out certain things about the world,
    but this is very different from realizing that you can make a living at finding out things in this field.

Martin was the son of a consulting engineer,
    who had had some college training.
His mother had worked as a reporter for a while after she finished high school.
He says,

&ldquo;I can&#39;t remember much about grade school except the fact that I got reasonably decent grades right along and that I was fairly interested in science and mathematics.
I had a friend in 7th or 8th grade who was the son of a druggist and we got a chemistry set between us and played around with it and almost blew up the house.
We spent our spare time memorizing the table of elements.
I never got along in languages, I couldn&#39;t see any sense in memorizing grammar.
In history I read so much I had many more facts than the rest whether they were right or not.
I think probably the interest in science was partly because of father.
When he was home he liked to do shop work and I used to do some with him.
He was rather meticulous and in some ways this was discouraging for a beginner.&rdquo;

Several things about this statement are very characteristic of theoretical physical scientists.
All of them liked school.
Most of them preferred mathematics and science to other subjects.
A number of them spoke of dabbing in chemistry,
    and of still being surprised that they had not blown up the house,
    and many of them did other sorts of things with their hands,
    such as the shop work mentioned by Martin.
His mention of memorizing the table of elements reminds me of another of this group who became interested in mineralogy when he was a boy and who papered his room with sheets of paper on which he had copied tables and descriptions of minerals.

Martin goes on to say,

&ldquo;I was rather sickly.
I imagine it was more allergic than anything else,
    although it was not recognized at the time,
    and I was out sick two or three months each year.
One term in high school I was only there for a month.
It was always something special;
    my brothers and sisters always had measles and things like that but those never bothered me.
I had tonsils and adenoids, hay fever, a mastoid, and appendicitis.
This meant that during most of the winter months I didn&#39;t get out and I got to reading fairly early.
Since I was in the 8th grade I&#39;ve been in the habit of reading 4 books or more a week.
I read pretty much anything.
If Tm working hard in physics I like to relax by reading history or almost anything but physics.
One spell in high school, when I was sick for three months, I decided I was going to go into history and I spent the time in drawing up a historical chart beginning with the Egyptians.&rdquo;

His frequent illnesses, and his omnivorous reading are also characteristic of this group.
There were only three who had had no serious physical problems during childhood, and all of them read intensely and almost anything they could get their hands on.
Two of them remarked that they thought they got their first interest in science from reading science fiction.
Reading, of course, is not a very social occupation, and the physicists, like the biologists, rather tended to be quite shy.
Martin, however, is unlike the others in that he got over this rather suddenly, although not very early.

&ldquo;I did very little going out in high school.
Mother was very worried about it.
I felt very shy.
I started in my junior year in college and all of a sudden found it interesting and easy and rather overdid it for a while.
Let&#39;s see if I can remember how it happened.
I just happened to get in with a group of fellows and girls who were interested in artistic things.
I started going to the symphony concerts at that time and we got in the habit of going Saturdays to Little Italy and sitting around and drinking wine and talking.
Since that time it&#39;s been a thing I could turn on or off at will.
There were a number of periods before my marriage that I did a lot of running around and other times I&#39;d be too interested in something else.
I&#39;ve always been self-conscious at social functions and never cared very much for them.
With a few people it&#39;s different.&rdquo;

In high school one of the teachers had great influence on him,
    and this experience oriented him towards science at the same time that out of school experiences convinced him that he did not want to be a business man.
Not all of these men had occasion to spend any time in commercial activities,
    but quite a few of them did, usually in the course of making enough money to go to school.
None of them liked business except one of the biologists who found it of interest but was glad to go back to science.
The extreme competitiveness, the indifference to fact,
    the difficulty of doing things personally,
    all were distasteful to them.

&ldquo;The first few years in high school I don&#39;t remember anything special about, except that I managed to get fairly decent grades in mathematics.
I took physics and didn&#39;t like it.
I had taken chemistry before I got there,
    but there was an extra course that sounded interesting so I took it and it turned out there were only four students in the course and a very interesting teacher.
He sort of took personal charge and let us do pretty much what we wanted except that he was extremely insistent that we take care and do a good job.
We worked through all of analytical chemistry there and I got a feeling for looking for small traces of elements, etc.
This convinced me that I wanted to be a chemist.
A little earlier I had gotten a job with the phone company which was with a fellow studying to be a chemist.
I read Slosson, <em>Creative Chemistry</em>.
This was the romantic thing to be.
I think that teacher had more individual influence on me than any other.&rdquo;

Some firm, apparently interested in increasing the supply of chemists, had sent <em>Creative Chemistry</em> around to a number of high schools, and it seems to have been a very successful promotion.
At least several others of my subjects mentioned having been influenced by it.

&ldquo;When I was still in high school I took a job one summer at a Yacht Club.
It was a navy camp and one of the instructors had been a radio operator.
He got me interested in radio and we played around a certain amount.
That winter he and two other radio amateurs decided to open a small radio equipment store in town and they asked me to go in.
Perhaps they thought father might help.
Dad did put up some money and we opened a small store and for a while I spent part time there.
When the craze hit in 1922 or 1923 the place was about swamped, it was the only store in town.
What was made on the store pretty much paid my way through college.
While this episode was interesting I was pretty sure I didn&#39;t want to go into business.
You always got essentially people fighting you.
During part of this time in addition to working at the store I had been a part-time radio writer for one of the papers.
While that was interesting, too, it didn&#39;t appeal as a life work either.
By then I was convinced I wanted to go on in academic work.

&ldquo;College was actually pretty much taken for granted.
My mother was convinced from the beginning that all her children were going to college.
I just went to college expecting to be a chemist.
I had no very special idea about it.
Two things happened in my freshman year.
I took the college chemistry course plus the lab course.
The lab course threw me for a complete loss.
I think it was taught by a poor teacher who was careless of the reagents and they weren&#39;t pure.
I got traces of everything and reported it.
I didn&#39;t like the way the course was taught because I was told everything I was supposed to do and it soured me on chemistry.

&ldquo;I got acquainted with a young man who had just come there as an astronomer and was teaching mathematics.
He was perhaps the most inspiring teacher I had.
He let you go if you wanted to go.
I needed some money so I helped arrange the library and so I had a chance to look over the mathematics books.
At the end of the year I decided the devil with chemistry, I&#39;m going into physics.

&ldquo;At that time the college had a course in physics which was not popular.
My class had three students and this gave us personal attention.
I thought of going on with it.
My father was very dubious about it.
He wasn&#39;t sure that physics was a thing you could get along with but he didn&#39;t push it very hard.
He talked to me about it once and said,
    &#39;You will have to go on in university work and won&#39;t make any money.&#39;
I said I knew that and he said `If you realize it, that&#39;s all right.&#39;
There was nothing special about the course except at the end of that year a prize examination was given.
At that time physics was taught practically everywhere without the use of calculus and still is in many places.
We didn&#39;t get calculus until our sophomore year in mathematics and I still can remember the annoyance and the feeling of being cheated out of an extra year or so of activity by not having had it earlier.
At any rate the physics course was given with the calculus but didn&#39;t use it.
So about the middle of the second term I got disgusted and decided I wanted to learn physics the right way and asked the teacher for a text.
He smiled and gave me one and I studied that so when the exam came along I gave it all in calculus and got the prize.
This confirmed me, of course, and the next two years were extremely pleasant.
I divided my time pretty much between astronomy and physics.
There were just three of us and we&#39;d go to the professor and say we had finished up this and what should we do next and he would say,
    &#39;What do you want to do?&#39; So we&#39;d tell him and he would give us manuals and get the old apparatus out and usually it would have to be cleaned and fixed up,
    and he would tell us to work it up and we would have a fine time.

&ldquo;My teacher felt I should go on to do graduate work.
This was kind of a surprise to the family and a little bit of a worry because my brothers and sisters were coming along and there wasn&#39;t too much money.
But I applied for scholarships at three places and took the second offer.
My main danger the first year was to keep from galloping off in 24 different directions at once.
I found it extremely interesting and exciting.
I started work on an experimental problem,
    but then I would get an idea for a theoretical paper and work on that for a while,
    and then go back to the other.

&ldquo;I think my teacher in high school had given me a few nudges in the direction of research.
Both the professors at college with whom I was in close personal contact and saw daily were active in research themselves and I just soaked that stuff up.
I find it hard to think back to the time when the idea of research and just spending all the time I had available on trying to understand anything wasn&#39;t just there.&rdquo;


The story of George, who became an experimental physicist is quite a different one, but it is fairly characteristic of the experimentalists.
He did some manual things as farm boys do, but was not particularly interested,
    and he did not have radio sets and gadgets of one sort or another.
Farm boys didn&#39;t then.
Nor did he do any particular amount of reading.
So far as he knows none of his family had gone to college before him,
    although some have gone since; his father had had about a 6th grade education and his mother one year of high school.
He started out in the usual 7 months country school,
    near home, but his going on was unusual.
He says,

&ldquo;My father and mother were rather an exception in the community which can be pointed out in this way.
We lived out in the country about 7 or 8 miles from a high school.
The country school to which we went was very close but when I finished seventh grade the school was having its usual ups and downs and the high school was no good.
So my father and mother decided to send me to another school and it required boarding me away from home,
    and that was quite the talk of the area,
    that they would waste money boarding me.

&ldquo;My recreations were the usual ones, physical activities.
Whereas most parents in that neighborhood believed that children when not in school should work along with the hired help,
    both father and mother adopted the attitude that they expected me to do a certain amount of work but didn&#39;t care when I did it.
They would lay out a certain amount per day and if I wanted to get up and work hard and be through with it that was up to me.
That was always criticized because I was always enticing the other boys away when they were supposed to be at work.
I earned the title of being one of the laziest boys.
Father required only that I do my work and do it well.
He did this with the other help as far as possible, too,
    like piece work.
From that I learned how to make time on manual things and at the same time to do as well as required.
But we had no tools and I did no carpentering.
Up until I went to graduate school I never knew I had any ability in that respect at all.
I didn&#39;t do a great deal of reading. In those days the books that were available were novels and I wasn&#39;t particularly interested.

&ldquo;I think I wanted to go to high school.
At least I was perfectly willing to go.
It came rather suddenly.
I don&#39;t think very much was said about it until possibly a few days before I went.
I suspect my mother had more to do with it, she had thought it out very well,
    but I don&#39;t think she said much even to father.
His reaction was that as long as I did well he&#39;d help me go to school.
If I failed I could come home and work.
He always thought farming too hard for anyone and that anyone who had intelligence would get off it.
The first year or so was pretty rugged.
It was difficult to find a satisfactory place to stay.
We had one little course in physics in high school, not a lab course, and the usual mathematics.
I think I was probably the top of the class in that.

&ldquo;There was an incident there that has always been amusing to me.
The only time I had any trouble in school was with the physics teacher.
About the middle of the year she was showing how the water level in the boilers was determined.
She left the gauge open and I said all the water would go out.
The argument got hotter and hotter and finally I volunteered to show her,
    at which time I got thrown out of class.
There again it was what father always said,
    you have to think things out for yourself.&rdquo;

This is the sort of incident that can happen when a teacher (or parent) is so insecure as to be unable to tolerate the suggestion that she might be mistaken, or might lack some particular piece of knowledge.

The experimentalists are like the theorists in their early preference for mathematics and science classes,
    and their disinterest in languages,
    and difficulty with them is somewhat greater than that shown by the theorists.
Very few of the experimentalists were avid readers.
The teachers at George&#39;s school were all college graduates,
    and the principal talked a good deal about going on to college.
George was early determined to go.
He liked school work, he did not like farming,
    and he had some idea of going into medicine.
He tells how he happened to think of this.

&ldquo;I started out for medicine.
Along about the time I was 14,
    there was a young doctor came to the community and he boarded in my home.
I used to drive a car for him and I got rather interested.
My real interest got started from an incident one afternoon when a colored child had gotten badly burnt.
Neither parent could hold the child and a neighbor couldn&#39;t do it either so he came out to the car and asked me if I thought I could hold the child and give it ether.
It was  badly burned.
Apparently I succeeded because that night he told my mother she had a young surgeon in the family.
Maybe that started it, but when I went to college I intended to go into medicine.

&ldquo;I went to the nearest college.
The medicine idea shifted gradually.
Two things happened, I think, that caused a shift.
One was that by pure accident, in the first year mathematics course I was lucky to be in the section of an exceedingly good teacher.
I always liked to be in the back of the room if I could.
It seemed that during the first week this professor would start asking questions and begin at the front end,
    and by the time it came back to me I would have been able to get the answer,
    from the book or by working it out.
Then he began another trick,
    if he didn&#39;t get the answer on the first three or four he would say,
    &#39;How about my old standby?&#39; and call on me so I felt I had to know it.
From that he began to take quite an interest in my work and before the year was out began talking about my working up the second year for myself during the summer.
So I promised I&#39;d try and he said he&#39;d give me an examination in the fall and then I could go into the third year which he taught.
I never have known if I passed it or if he let me by,
    but I went on with him. He wanted me to specialize in mathematics,
    and along with that there happened another incident.

&ldquo;I had become engaged to my wife and she wasn&#39;t keen about being a doctor&#39;s wife and undoubtedly that had an influence on me.
She wanted her husband at home a reasonable amount of the time.
As it turned out, especially during the war,
    that isn&#39;t just what she got.
So I gradually drifted in the direction of mathematics.
The second summer I worked up some other courses and at the end of the third year had completed four years of mathematics.
Along with it I took one course in physics but I wasn&#39;t particularly interested,
    and I had one year of chemistry.
The last year I found all I lacked for a B.A. instead of a B.S. which wasn&#39;t considered as good a degree, was a year of Greek so I took that.
It was a kind of training that to my mind is lacking today.
I even wound up with the highest grade in the class.

&ldquo;The idea of going on to graduate school came from this math professor.
When I started I only intended to go through for an M.A.
I didn&#39;t see my way clear further.
This professor helped me to get a fellowship and that plus my father plus my wife&#39;s working made it possible for me to go.
I started out intending to spend a year and a half and get an M.A. and go out teaching in mathematics.

&ldquo;Then again one of these things happened.
The first summer I took two courses in mathematics and for some strange reason I was assigned a course in physics.
The two courses in mathematics were taught by two foreigners and they were the two most discouraging courses I&#39;ve ever had in my life.
One in particular was taught by a famous English mathematician and he was teaching completely over our heads.
I thought it was my own dumbness.
I worked as hard as I ever worked in my life and accomplished as little.
A few days before the exam I mentioned it to one of the other students and he was feeling the same way.
So the next class he had the nerve to go in before the teacher came in and he went up front and asked and pretty soon he discovered most of us were in the same boat so when the professor came in we stopped him and told him this.
He asked around the class and they mostly said the same.
He had assumed we had had two years of mathematics that we hadn&#39;t had and so he gave an exam I could have passed in high school.
I was thoroughly disgusted with mathematics.
The only course that was half decent was the physics course but I wasn&#39;t prepared for that.

&ldquo;At the end of the summer I thought I wouldn&#39;t go on with graduate school and I decided to go down town and get a job.
If I still felt the same way I&#39;d just continue working instead of going back next term.
I got a job as a salesman.
That was another lucky stroke.
I went down and started putting the same effort into that.
I began selling boys&#39; shirts and I&#39;d never bought a shirt in my life, mother always did.
So I went to the library and got out three books on cloth.
I read two that night and by the second day I understood a little more.
I thought that if you wanted to be helpful in selling and it would be your job to learn what you were selling and it paid off as far as sales were concerned.
Of course then it was said I was a sales grabber so I was told to take my turn.
I said that was all right and did take my turn but I still maintained the highest sales,
    but it was because by then I was selecting out the good quality.
I got called down for that,
    and they said there would be a lot of returns,
    but I asked them to check it and there were hardly any.
Then I had a run-in with the buyer and was transferred upstairs to sports goods and the same thing happened there.
It was the same old trouble.
No one ever bothered to study their stuff.
At the end of the month I saw very clearly that in an industrial job you didn&#39;t get anywhere by knowing more or doing more than anyone else.
By that time I was convinced that that side of the world was a pretty sorry one.

&ldquo;By then I had also decided I didn&#39;t want to go on in mathematics.
That one course convinced me that physics was what I wanted.
I had my fellowship transferred and had a long fuss with the Dean who wanted to assign courses and I wanted to work up to them.
So I started out from there and with essentially undergraduate courses.

&ldquo;I liked it very much better and I found I somehow had time on my hands and very soon I wanted to try my hand in the lab.
I had never had any tools in my hand.
Again I had a lucky break.
I went down and told the professor and said I&#39;d like to try and I&#39;d be glad to begin by opening boxes or anything else.
He laughed and said as it happened there were a lot of boxes to open and so he put me to work.
Presumably lying dormant in my fingers was an ability I didn&#39;t know I had.
Within a month I challenged him that I could make an electroscope work better than he and I won.
I&#39;ve always wondered if he let me do it;
    he never would admit it but I would not expect him to.

&ldquo;I found that almost anything in experimental work I had no difficulty in doing.
Glass-blowing and so on just came to me overnight.
I learned mainly just by doing it.
Machine work was all pretty much the same way.
Handling the tools just came naturally as if I had been doing it for years.
So much so that when I came here and took over the shop I said I&#39;d never ask them to do anything I couldn&#39;t do myself.
At first they sometimes said they couldn&#39;t do things, but I always showed them and since then there hasn&#39;t been any question.&rdquo;



It is rare to find any planning ahead in the early years.
Mostly the men just go from one thing to another, as occasion offers.
The next story is particularly interesting from this point of view.
He had an early bent to mechanical things.
He went to college, largely because of his mother&#39;s dreams for him,
    but even there and after he had courses in physics,
    it was some time before he found out about research.
His story is a particularly good illustration, too,
    of a sort of unconsciousness about many aspects of living that is not uncommon at the college years,
    and not unheard of beyond them.
Ernest described himself to me as an experimentalists but one of his colleagues once told me that his greatest contributions had been theoretical.

&ldquo;I really can&#39;t say when I got interested in things mechanical but it&#39;s just about as early as I can remember.
About 6 or so I was interested in pretty much anything electrical,
    the usual things that kids are interested in, autos and so on.

&ldquo;Father never got even through high school and started at practically hard labor at 13 and got from that to be a star salesman.
I don&#39;t know when he found time for the things he did.
He was quite athletic and at that time there were amateur athletic groups and he was stroke.
I never realized how good he was at the time but later I found some old papers and found that his crew was the best anywhere around.
All the training was done after a day&#39;s work.
Then some time later some of the books I read when I was a kid were some International Correspondence School texts on engineering which he had studied.
That&#39;s a lot of work when you are working hard too.
Father was a better man than I was or ever will be.
Even when I was young and strong, my father was much stronger and tougher than I was always.&rdquo;

References to parents show marked differences in the attitudes of the sons.
Ernest&#39;s respect for his father was very great,
    and this is generally characteristic of the physical scientists.
It is less characteristic for them to have any great feeling of closeness to their fathers,
    or great affection, but Ernest and his father seem to have been very close.

&ldquo;Father had a strong mechanical bent and I learned quite a bit from him without realizing it.
From the age of ten or so I was entrusted with keeping his car serviced.
By the time I was 12 there were several of us interested in radio and we made a set.
I was sort of leader and I did most of the designing and construction,
    the others did the operating.
This was a transmitting and receiving station.
I was always sure I wanted to be something of the engineering sort.
I had never heard the word physicist,
    of course, and neither had either of my parents.
I had fairly large sets.
Meccano and Erector, at a rather early age.
You can get a lot of action for a reasonable amount of money.
The folks would buy motors for toys and when I got to be old enough to be a radio amateur I was more organized and then it was mainly a question of making up my mind what I needed.
We had all kinds of complicated arrangements.
For a while we formed a small company to manufacture transformers.
It was sort of a joke.
%% NOTE:
%The power company was putting in a lot of new transformers, and so we got any amount of stuff given us by the uncle of one of the boys and then we cooked up a deal with another&#39;s uncle to dig a cellar for \$20 or \$30 worth of wire, and we made some transformers and sold them.
I never worked so hard in my life.
We sure found things out the hard way.
We had considerable instruction but it was practically all of it from books and we found out how to do it the wrong way first always.
It just happened there were no radio amateurs around who knew more than we did so they learned from us.

&ldquo;Father never helped me make anything.
On the other hand if I asked him how to do something he always knew and he had tools around which he got for his own purposes and which I appropriated so it&#39;s hard to describe.
He never gave me any formal instruction but I learned a lot.
Not about electricity but about mechanical things he was very, very good.

&ldquo;In high school I took chemistry and physics, all there was of both, about a year of each, and then some odds and ends of surveying and such courses.
I took all there was of math and some that didn&#39;t exist,
    i.e. the math teachers were very interested in me and awfully kind to me and gave me instruction in things that weren&#39;t really on the books and I learned some on the side myself.

&ldquo;I got through high school quite young and my folks didn&#39;t think I ought to go to college quite so soon so they sent me for a year to the technical high school there,
    so I had perhaps better training than ordinary in that way.
That was a well-run course.
I spent most of my time in the machine shop.

&ldquo;Going to college wasn&#39;t taken for granted.
My father was the son of immigrant parents and had his first job as a black-smith, so college tradition in the family wasn&#39;t strong.
It was mother&#39;s idea.
Her father was a minister and she was of a fairly well educated family.
Among my boy friends none went to college.
I always had had a good time in school and would just read anything.
I wouldn&#39;t say I liked all my studies but I liked anything scientific or mathematical and was all in favor of more school.
Father was all for it but it was mother&#39;s idea in the first place.

&ldquo;I got a scholarship and went to college intending to become an electrical engineer that being the nearest thing we knew of to what I was interested in.
Then my money ran out and I went home and continued in the college there.
About then I had to take sophomore courses in physics and the professor thought well of me and he said, &#39;Why don&#39;t you go into physics?&#39;
It seemed a lot of fun and he thought he could stir me up a job at another college and said there wasn&#39;t much difference between the physics and the electrical engineering courses and I could change back if I wanted to.
I guess he must have done some considerable wrangling but he got me a job as assistant when I was a junior, and I came up here and thought that was a lot of fun.

&ldquo;I was pretty young and I guess not any too noticing about some things.
I didn&#39;t realize there was such a thing as research either at that time.
One fine day I was downstairs and saw someone wandering down the hall with a soldering iron, something I recognized.
He was a graduate student and didn&#39;t look like he knew what he was going to do so I went with him to help and spent most of my junior year working on his research and had a high old time working on it.

&ldquo;This was a small place in those days.
No one told me how things ran.
I didn&#39;t know about any of the places where people gathered.
I&#39;d seen this fellow around the teaching labs but I&#39;d never heard of the idea of research.
I&#39;d taken courses and I thought that teaching was what professors did.
The fellow I assisted for was one of the few that did not do research and I just saw him in his teaching laboratory.
I didn&#39;t have any idea of what the student I helped was trying to do.
I could see he was building things that he didn&#39;t know how to do and I did so I helped him for the fun of it.

&ldquo;There was an International Research Fellow here.
He&#39;s a smart guy but pretty excitable and not dependable.
By the time I got to be a senior it got to be recognized that I was pretty useful in the lab so they gave me to him for research associate and by that time it got time for me to graduate and I began to wonder what to do.
This research Fellow was offered a job elsewhere and he could bring along anyone he wanted so he asked me if I wouldn&#39;t like to go and I said sure.
The next day I ran into the department head and told him this and he didn&#39;t say anything about it,
    but after a couple of weeks passed I got an offer of an instructorship here and that surprised me and I accepted.
So I stayed here to get a Ph.D. I was only 20 and just had hardly grown up yet.
I took chemistry too and got along well in it and had a good time.
I&#39;m sure I would have been happy as a chemist only I just had more experience of thinking mechanically that made me seem to fit into physics better.

&ldquo;As it happened I worked on several problems at once,
    but the one I did my thesis on was a joint paper with the head,
    so he really suggested the problem and I just worked with him.
It&#39;s a very rare student that can tell a good problem when he sees one,
    can start it off and carry it through.
I certainly couldn&#39;t have.&rdquo;
