Optical instruments&emdash;cameras, projectors, telescopes, and microscopes&emdash;usually are built with lenses; that is, with pieces of refractive materials to converge or diverge light according to our design.
A whole industry is devoted to the design and production of such instruments or their components.
All these instruments are understood and designed in terms of Snell&#39;s law.
The whole field of applications rests on the simple summary of refraction that we reached in the last chapter, $n_1\sin\theta_1= n_2\sin\theta_2$.
Most optical technology stems from this little bit of physics.

In this chapter, we want to learn how the laws of refraction are related to the construction of lenses and optical systems.
An extensive treatment of the design of optical systems is, however, beyond the purpose of this chapter.

## The Convergence of Light by a Set of Prisms
\label{sec:14-1}

We found in Chapter 12 that we could control and redirect light beams by the use of curved mirrors.
Devices that can accomplish similar purposes through refraction, instead of reflection, are called lenses.
To understand how a lens operates, let us examine the behavior of light in passing through the combination of a plate of glass with parallel sides and the two triangular prisms shown in Fig. \ref{fig:14-1} (a).
If a parallel beam of light falls on this system from the left, so that it is normally incident on the plate of glass, it will behave as indicated by the rays shown in the figure.
The light that passes through the plate in the center will continue along its original direction, since the angle of incidence is $0^{\circ}$.
Light striking the upper prism will be deviated downward by an amount depending on the opening angle of the prism and on its index of refraction.
Similarly, light striking the lower prism will be deviated upward.
As a result, there is a region, shown shaded in the figure, through which passes almost all of the light that falls on the plate and the prisms.


<figure>
\label{fig:14-1}
\caption{Construction of a lens by the process of subdividing prismatic sections.}
</figure>


The convergence of a parallel beam of light into a limited region by this system resembles the convergence of a similar beam by a set of mirrors.
(See Section 12-6.) While working with mirrors, we decreased the size of the region into which the light was converged by using an increased number of mirrors, each smaller than the original one. Let us try the same scheme here.
Fig. \ref{fig:14-1} (b) shows parts of the central plate and of the two prisms cut away and replaced by pieces of new prisms.
The size of the shaded region is clearly smaller than it was before.


If we continue the process of removing parts of the prisms and replacing them by sections having smaller opening angles, we come closer and closer to a piece of glass with the smoothly curved surface shown in Fig. \ref{fig:14-1} (c).
This device is the limit that is approached as we increase the number of prisms indefinitely, just as the parabolic mirror of Fig. 12-16 was the limit approached as we used more and more plane mirrors to converge parallel light.
In Fig. \ref{fig:14-2} we have actually carried out the construction indicated in Fig. \ref{fig:14-1}.
The lens produced by the process that we have outlined converges all of the parallel light that strikes it to a line as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:14-3}.

## Lenses
\label{sec:14-2}

The device we have just constructed is called a cylindrical lens.
Notice that we have not given any definition of the surfaces of the lens, except that they are obtained by increasing indefinitely the number of sections of prisms that are used to converge the light.
It is possible to show that these surfaces are approximated very closely by circular cylinders.
In other words, the lines representing the surfaces in Fig. \ref{fig:14-1} (c) are arcs of circles.
The differences between the ideal surfaces and those of circular cylinders are very slight whenever both the width of the lens and its maximum thickness are considerably smaller than the distance from the lens to the line at which parallel light is converged.


Cylindrical lenses bring the light from a distant point source of light to a focus along a line.
For most purposes we prefer that the light from a point source should be focused at a point.
This focusing can be accomplished by constructing a lens whose surfaces curve equally in all directions.
Such surfaces are portions of spheres.
Almost all lenses are bounded by two spherical surfaces.


The line passing through the center of the lens and on which the centers of the two spheres are located is called the axis of the lens.
The point on this axis at which incident parallel rays focus or converge is the principal focus, <span class="math">F</span>.
The distance of the principal focus from the center of the lens is known as the focal length, <span class="math">f</span>

The two surfaces of a lens do not always have the same radius.
For example, the lens shown in Fig. \ref{fig:14-4} has a spherical surface of much larger radius at its right-hand boundary than it has at the left.

<figure>
\label{fig:14-4}
\caption{A lens with surfaces of unequal radii.}
</figure>


If a lens is thin compared to its focal length, it makes no difference which side of the lens the light enters, the focal length is always the same. 
This symmetry is obvious if the lens is itself symmetric.
That it is true for all thin lenses can easily be shown by an experiment in which a lens is used to focus the parallel rays of the sun to a point on a piece of paper or cardboard.
If the lens is then flipped over, the focus occurs at the same distance from the lens (Fig. \ref{fig:14-5}).

This result is also predicted by a detailed application of Snell&#39;s law from which we find
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{1}{f} = \left(n-1\right) \left(\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)
\end{equation*}


where <span class="math">R_1</span> and <span class="math">R_2</span> are the radii of the opposing spherical surfaces.
\footnote{
    We shall not give the proof of this &ldquo;lens maker&#39;s&rdquo; formula here.
    Although no new physics is involved, the proof is a long-winded application of trigonometry and Snell&#39;s law.
    Later, however, we can use the results of further study to get the formula more easily. It is therefore discussed at the end of Part II (see pages 302-303).
}
We see that interchanging <span class="math">R_1</span> and <span class="math">R_2</span>, which is equivalent to turning the lens aver, does not change the calculated value of/.

From this equation, we can also see that when <span class="math">R_1</span> and <span class="math">R_2</span> are small, the lens will have a short focal length. 
This is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:14-6} where we see that the paths of light rays through the lens in (b) are bent more sharply, so that the focal length is shorter than in (a).

## Real Images Formed by Lenses
\label{sec:14-3}

We have thus far concentrated our attention on the focusing of light by a lens when the light comes from a very distant object.
In the practical use of lenses, we are commonly interested in the light coming from near-by objects and we all know that lenses do form images of such objects.
We can locate the images with the help of the knowledge that we have gained about the behavior of initially parallel rays.


<figure>
\label{fig:14-5}
\caption{
    The principal foci of a lens. For thin lenses the focal distance is the same for parallel light entering either the side with a small radius (a) or the side with a larger radius (b).
}
</figure>

Fig. \ref{fig:14-7} shows a lens, an object <span class="math">H_0</span>, and its image <span class="math">H_i</span>.
To find the location of this image, we draw the two principal rays from the top of the object, one ray parallel to the axis and the other through the principal focus <span class="math">F_2</span>.
The ray parallel to the axis is bent by the lens so as to pass through the principal focus <span class="math">F_1</span>.
We also know that rays coming from the right and parallel to the axis would be deviated to pass through the other principal focus <span class="math">F_2</span>.
It follows from the reversibility of light paths that the ray from the top of H that passes through <span class="math">F_2</span> from the left must travel parallel to the axis after it has passed through the lens.
All rays starting from the top of <span class="math">H_0</span> will converge very close to the point at which these two bent rays intersect.
This point is therefore the real image of the top of <span class="math">H_0</span>.


We could have chosen any other point on the object and located its image in the same way.
Had we done so for a number of points, we would have found that the image, <span class="math">H_i</span>, falls along the line that is shown in the figure.


<figure>
\label{fig:14-6}
\caption{The shorter the radius of the surface of a lens, the shorter the focal length.}
</figure>

You probably have noticed that, in constructing the two principal rays, we have not considered the exact path of the ray within the lens, but have broken it sharply.
This approximate construction is good enough for our present purposes because our location of the two principal foci is accurate only if the lens thickness (at its center) is small compared with the focal length.
The only lenses to which our construction accurately applies are therefore thin lenses.
For the purposes of ray diagrams, we may consider such lenses to be circular plates perpendicular to the axis.


Convex lenses, like parabolic mirrors, focus parallel rays to a point. Lenses, therefore, obey the same equation relating image distance, focal length, and object distance as do mirrors:
\begin{equation*}
    S_i S_o = f^2.
\end{equation*}

The proof of this equation in the case of convex lenses is the same as for mirrors (Section 12-9).
As there, we use the shaded similar triangles formed by the principal rays shown in Fig. 14-7.
Considering first the shaded similar triangles to the left of the lens, we see that $H_i/H_0 = f/S_o$.
The shaded triangles to the right of the lens give $H_i/H_0 = S_i/f$.
Combining the two equations, we have
\begin{equation*}
    S_o S_i = f^2.
\end{equation*}

## Camera, Projector, and Eye
\label{sec:14-4}

Produce an image of the sun with a convex lens.
Since the sun is far away, the image is formed practically at the principal focus and you can see it there on a piece of paper.
Images of closer objects lie beyond the principal focus; and, in order to capture them on paper or on a photographic film, we have to change the distance between lens and film.
To make a photographic camera, then, we usually make a light-tight box with a bellows that allows us to move the lens.
By adjusting the length of the bellows, we can place a sharp image on the photographic film.
With some cameras we can place a piece of ground glass where the film is later inserted.

<figure>
\label{fig:14-7}
\caption{The formation of a real image by a converging lens.}
</figure>


<figure>
\label{fig:14-8}
\caption{A camera. The rays of light that form the image of the head of the arrow are indicated.}
</figure>

We can then view the image directly and focus sharply on the particular object we want to photograph (Fig. \ref{fig:14-8}).

As long as the object is more than twice the focal distance from the lens, so that <span class="math">S_o</span> is longer than <span class="math">f</span>, the image size is smaller than the object, as $H_i/H_0 = f/S_o$ shows.
When a small object is brought closer to the principal focus, the image moves to distances behind the lens that are large compared with the focal length; also, the image becomes bigger than the object.
Consequently, to photograph small objects, a lens of short focal length is useful.

<figure>
\label{fig:14-9}
\caption{The lens of an eye adjusted to focus the light from a distant object (a) and from one near by.}
</figure>


A projector is just a camera worked backwards.
You can make one by taking the back off a camera, mounting the slides or film where the film usually goes, and shining a bright light through the film and out through the lens.
The lens then forms an enlarged image well in front of the camera, where you can place a screen.


In cameras, projectors, and other man-made optical instruments, images are always brought into focus by changing the position of a lens with respect to the object.
The eye, on the other hand, is unusual: it focuses images on the retina by changing its curvature and hence the focal length of its lens.
When an object is at a very large distance from the eye, the rays entering the eye are nearly parallel and an image is formed at the principal focus as shown in Fig. 14-9 (a).
When a close-by object is viewed, the image is formed beyond the focal point, and eye muscles form the elastic eye lens into a sharper curve, decreasing its focal length so that a real image will form on the retina [Fig. 14-9 (b)].

## The Magnifier or Simple Microscope
\label{sec:14-5}

Let us go back to the small object that we brought close to the principal focus of a lens.
As the object is moved through the principal focus the real image moves infinitely far away on the other side of the lens; and when the object is between the lens and the principal focus a virtual image is formed behind the object just as in the case of a concave mirror that we discussed in Section 12-10.
The situation is illustrated in Fig. 14-10. As in the case of the concave mirror, the convex lens always forms an enlarged virtual image.


What is the maximum magnification that we can obtain in this way?
If we wish to see the greatest possible detail in an object, we get it as close to the eye as possible, thus giving a large real image on the retina of the eye.
But there is a limit to how close we can view an object.
As the object gets closer to the eye, the eye muscles must change the shape of the eye lens so that its radius of curvature becomes smaller and smaller in order to form a sharply focused real image on the retina.
Soon a limit is reached; the adult eye cannot accommodate to an object closer than about <span class="math">25</span> cm.
This object distance is called the distance of most distinct vision.
Try bringing a pencil closer and closer to your eye.
You will see more and more detail until finally, with a great straining of your eye muscles, you can no longer keep a sharp image.
Is your distance of most distinct vision greater or less than the average of <span class="math">25</span> cm?


A convex lens helps us to see more detail by forming an enlarged virtual image which we can place at a comfortable distance from the eye.
We notice in Fig. \ref{fig:14-10} that no matter where the object is placed between the lens and <span class="math">F_2</span>, the top of the image always lies on the line $F_1 D$, and $H_i = \frac{H_0}{f} S_i$ as usual.

Consequently, to make the image look as large as possible we should bring our eye right up to the lens as in Fig. 14-11; and in addition we should move the object (or the lens and our eye) until the image gets as close as we can clearly accommodate.
This is the way to get the largest angle between the rays entering our eye from the top and from the bottom of the object; and since this light is what the eye works with, it is the way to make the object (or its virtual image) look largest.

<figure>
\label{fig:14-10}
\caption{Formation of a virtual image by a converging lens.}
</figure>

Now for our own comfort we place the image at the distance of most distinct vision <span class="math">d</span>, so the image distance <span class="math">S_i</span>, (measured from <span class="math">F_1</span>) is approximately given by $S_i = d + f$.
Therefore
\begin{equation*}
    H_i = \frac{H_0}{f} S_i = \frac{H_0}{f} (d+f) = H_0 \left(\frac{d}{f}+1\right).
\end{equation*}

Furthermore, since we are looking at this image from the distance of most distinct vision just as we could best look at the object without the aid of the lens, the magnification of the image we see is $H_i/H_0$.
That is, maximum magnification is

This equation tells us the greatest magnification of a simple microscope.
What, then, determines how great a magnification we can get?
The focal length, <span class="math">f</span>, of the convex lens is the determining factor; the smaller it is, the greater the magnification.
In order to get a small/we use glass of high refractive index to produce sharper bending of the light for a given curvature of the lens surfaces.
Also we need surfaces of small radius (sharp curvature).
But a small radius of curvature means a small lens size, since the lens diameter cannot

## Limitations of Optical Instruments
\label{sec:14-7}

If you hold a magnifying glass close to this page, you can see a clear, undistorted and slightly magnified image of the print.
Now slowly raise the glass from the paper and at the same time increase the distance between your eyes and the lens.
At some positions the image appears distorted.
If your eyes are far enough from the glass, you may also detect some rainbow colors when looking at a corner of the page.
In Figure 14-13 we see three pictures.
They were made by looking through the same lens.
In the first picture the lens was held so that the page of the telephone book lies entirely (but slightly) below the focal region; in the second picture the page is in the focal region; and in the last the focal region lies below the page.
Clearly, in each case the image of the page looks quite different from the page itself.
Part of the game of designing really good optical instruments is to minimize the geometrical distortions so apparent in these pictures.


What are the origins of these defects in images?
First, we know even for mirrors (Chapter 12) that a surface designed to bring light from one small object to a sharp focus is not the correct surface to bring light to an exact focus from an object at a different place.
The same is true for lens surfaces.
Some blurring of the image therefore results.
In addition, when we look through different parts of a lens the images are at different positions (and the magnification is different).

The image therefore is distorted.
In photography distortion and blurring are often cut down by using a &ldquo;stop,&rdquo; a barrier with a small hole in it so that we use only a selected portion of the lens.
The colored edges of images usually arise because of the dispersion of the light that passes through a lens.
The focal length of a lens is slightly longer for red light than it is for blue light, because the blue light is refracted more strongly than the red.
This undesirable effect is called chromatic aberration.
It can be greatly reduced by using a weakly diverging lens made of glass for which the index of refraction changes greatly with color, in conjunction with a strongly converging lens of glass for which the index of refraction changes less with color (Fig. 14-14).
This trick makes the focal properties of the whole system of lenses nearly the same for all colors.

<figure>
\label{fig:14-14}
\caption{
    A lens built of two pieces to minimize the different focal properties of different colors.
    Such doublets are often made with one common surface and glued together.
    They are called achromatic lenses.
}
</figure>


The problem of designing a system of lenses with the smallest amount of distortions and aberrations is a very complicated one.
But the complications arise only in the detailed applications of the laws of refraction; they involve no new principle.
Disentangling these complications will not enrich our understanding of basic optical phenomena, and therefore we shall not do it here.


There is one limiting factor affecting optical magnifiers which causes a blur in the image and is of a fundamental nature.
This is the inevitable diffraction which results from the limited size of the objective lens through which the light must pass.
At high magnification it is this blurring that prevents us from seeing finer and finer detail.
We shall learn more about diffraction in Chapter 19.
