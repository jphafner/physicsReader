The Greeks had no word for it.
To them the brain was merely &ldquo;the thing in the head,&rdquo; and completely negligible.
Concerned as so many of them were about man&#39;s possession of a mind, a soul, a spiritual endowment of the gods, it is strange they did not anticipate our much less enterprising philosophers of some score of centuries later, and invent at least a pocket in the head, a sensorium, to contain it.
But no, the Greeks, seeking a habitation for the mind, could find no better place for it than the midriff, whose rhythmic movements seemed so closely linked with what went on in the mind.

The Hebrews also attributed special dignity to that part of the body; thence Jehovah plucked man&#39;s other self.
Old ideas are not always as wide of the mark as they seem.
The rhythm of breathing is closely related to mental states.
The Greek word for diaphragm, phren, appears in such everyday words as frenzy and frantic, as well as in the discredited phrenology and the erudite schizophrenia.


Above the midriff the classical philosophers found the vapours of the mind; below it, the humours of the feelings.
Some of these ideas persisted in physiological thought until the last century and survive in the common speech of today.
Hysteric refers by derivation to the womb.
The four basic human temperaments were: choleric, referring to the gall bladder; phlegmatic, related to inflammation; melancholic, black bile; and sanguine, from the blood.
This classification of temperaments was revived by a modern physiologist, Pavlov, to systematize his observations of learning.


As in nearly all notions that survive as long as these fossils of language have survived, there is an element of truth, of observation, in them. States of mind are certainly related to the organs and liquors designated, and may even be said in a sense to originate in them.
The philosopher, William James, was responsible with Lange for a complete theory of emotion which invoked activity in the viscera as the essential precursor of deep feeling.
Some of the most primitive and finest phrases in English imply this dependence of sincere or deep emotion on heart or bowels.
But communication of thought is so rapid that the Greeks overlooked the existence or need of a relay station. And no doubt it is for the same reason that we all seem particularly given to the same error of over-simplification when we first begin, or refuse to begin, to consider how the mind works.
We know what makes us happy or unhappy.
Who, in the throes of sea-sickness, would think of dragging in the brain to account for his melancholy state?


More curious still is Greek negligence of the brain, considering their famous oracular behest, &ldquo;Know thyself.&rdquo;
Here indeed was speculation, the demand for a mirror, insistence upon a mirror. But for whom, for what? Was there, among the mysteries behind the altar, concealed perhaps in the Minerva myth, a suspicion of something more in the head than a thing, and that the organ which had to do the knowing of itself must be an organ of reflection?


The brain remained for more than two thousand years in the dark after its coming of age.
When it was discovered by the anatomist, he explored it as a substance in which might be found the secret dwelling of intelligence; for by that time the mind had moved from the diaphragm to the upper story, and Shakespeare had written of the brain, &ldquo;which some suppose the soul&#39;s frail dwelling-house.&rdquo;
Dissection was high adventure in those days.
Most people believed what an ironical writer today was &ldquo;astonished to learn,&rdquo; that &ldquo;it is possible for anger, envy, hatred, malice, jealousy, fear and pride, to be confined in the same highly perishable form of matter with life, intelligence, honesty, charity, patience and truth.*&#39; The search for such prize packets of evil and virtue in the brain tissue, dead or alive, could only lead to disappointment.
The anatomist had to be satisfied with weighing the &ldquo;grey matter&rdquo;&emdash;about 50 ounces for man and 5 less for woman&emdash;and making sketches of the very complicated and indeed perishable organisation of nerves and cells which his knife revealed.
He could do little more.
It should enlighten us at once as to the essential character of brain activity, that there was no possible understanding of the mechanism of the brain until the key to it, the electrical key, was in our hands.


There were some flashes of foresight, sparks in the scientific dark, before Galvani put his hand on the key.
What generated all the speculations of the day was a new notion in science, the conception of physical motion which began to acquire importance with Galileo and continued with Newton and into our own times with Rutherford and Einstein.
First among these imaginative flashes may be mentioned the novel proposal made by the 16th Century philosopher, Hobbes, when disputing the dualist theory of Descartes.
The French philosopher contemplated a non-spatial mind influencing the body through the brain, and suggested the pineal gland as the rendezvous for mind and matter.
The proposal advanced by Hobbes, in rejecting this popular theory, was that thought should be regarded as being produced by bodies in motion.
Hobbes was born in the year of the Spanish Armada; the Royal Society had received its charter seventeen years before he died in 1679.


The controversy about the residential status of the mind is almost as much out of date as that in which the nonexistence of motion seemed to be proved by the hare and tortoise fable.
But the value of Hobbes&#39; speculation was enduring; the observation and correlation of mental and physical phenomena are today a routine of physiological research.

More specific than the speculation of Hobbes was that of Dr. David Hartley about a century later.
Hartley in 1749 anticipated by two hundred years the kind of theory of mental function for which evidence has been found in the last year or two.
His &ldquo;Observations on Man, his Frame, his Duty and his Expectations&rdquo; is a milestone in the history of English thought.
Hartley, a contemporary of Newton and Hume, was a pioneer of what he termed the &ldquo;doctrine of mechanism.&rdquo;
According to this, he suggested, mental phenomena are derived from rhythmic movements in the brain&emdash;vibrations, he called them; upon these is superimposed a fine structure of &ldquo;vibratiuncles&rdquo; which give thought and personality their subtle shades and variations.
Hartley realised quite well the value of the plastic and compact virtues such a system might have.
He was also the first to develop the theory of &ldquo;association of ideas&rdquo; in a rigorous form, relating this to his &ldquo;vibratiuncles&rdquo; in a manner which we should now consider strictly scientific in the sense that it is susceptible to experimental test.
It is difficult for us to appreciate the originality of his notions, the gist of which is now a commonplace of electrophysiology.


Hartley wrote nearly half a century before Galvani (1737&endash;1798) and with him we might say farewell to fancy.
But to pass over the famous Galvani-Volta controversy with the bald statement that the one claimed to have discovered electricity in animals and the other its generation by metals, would be unfair to any reader who may not know how strangely truth came out of that maze of error.

The incident began with an experiment made by Luigi and Lucia Galvani in the course of their long and patient study of that still fresh mystery, electricity.
The word had been in use since William Gilbert coined it in the 16th century from elektron, meaning amber, another pretty semantic shift; and Henry Cavendish had already, eight years before the incident, determined the identity of its dynamic laws with those of gravitation.
Everybody in high society was familiar with the effects of discharges from Leyden jars upon the lifeless muscles of executed criminals; and Louis XV had, in the words of Silvanus Thomson, &ldquo;caused an electric shock from a battery of Leyden jars to be administered to 700 Carthusian monks joined hand to hand, with prodigious effect.&rdquo;
But in Bologna in 1790 the professor of anatomy had a notion that it was atmospheric electricity which acted upon the muscle tissues of animals.
On a stormy evening, one version of the story goes, he and his wife had the curious idea of testing this point by tying a dead frog to the top of the iron balustrade of the court-yard, apparently using copper wire to hold it by the leg.
They expected that, as the storm approached, the frog would be convulsed by electric shocks.
And, as they watched the thunder cloud come near, so indeed it happened; the dead frog, hanging against the iron grill, twitched in repeated convulsions.


Further experiments convinced the Galvani that they had witnessed a form of electricity derived from living processes, not merely from the atmosphere.
He published a famous account of his experiments on the relation of animal tissue to electricity: De viribus Electricitatis in Motu Musculari Commentarius (1791).
Volta seized upon this to refute the whole of Galvani&#39;s thesis, repeating his experiment not only without the storm but without the frog, proving that the electricity in question could be generated by copper and zinc sheets.
This &ldquo;current electricity&rdquo; as it was called, was therefore metallic, and no nonsense about any animal variety.
So ended a controversy and a friendship.
So began the science of electrical engineering.


Eppur, the Galvani might have repeated, <em>si muove</em>.
For their discredited experiment had truly revealed, not indeed what they supposed, but something more wonderful.
What had happened was that, swaying in the wind, the suspended frog had come into contact with the iron bars, between which and the copper wire a current had been generated, activating its muscles.
The Galvani had demonstrated the electrical aspect of nervous stimulation.


This was an event as important to the physiologist as its counter-event was to the physicist; it was the starting-point of that branch of the science with which we are concerned here, electrophysiology.


Volta&#39;s counter-demonstration led directly to the invention of the electric battery, and economic opportunity evoked electrical engineering from the Voltaic pile.
There was no such incentive for research when, a generation later, the existence of animal electricity was proved.
Instead, the discovery was exploited by the academic dilettante and the quack.
The Aristotelian doctors of the period, assuming that where there is electricity there is magnetism, saw in it proof also of Mesmer&#39;s &ldquo;Propositions&rdquo; which had been published in his &ldquo;Memoire sur la Decouverte du Magnetisme Animal&rdquo; in 1779, floundering deeper into mystification than Dr. Mesmer himself, who had at least declared in his &ldquo;Memoire&rdquo; that he used the term analogically, and that he &ldquo;made no further use of electricity or the magnet from 1776 onwards.&rdquo;

There is still controversy about the origin and nature of animal electricity.
Nobody who has handled an electric eel will question the ability of an animal to generate a formidable voltage; and the current is demonstrably similar in effect to that of a mineral dry cell.
On the other hand, there is no evidence that the electric energy in nerve cells is generated by electro-magnetic induction or by the accumulation of static charge.
The bio-chemist finds a complicated substance, acetylcholine, associated with electric changes; it would be reasonable to anticipate the presence of some such substance having a role at least as important as that of the chemicals in a Leclanch&eacute; cell.

We know that living tissue has the capacity to concentrate potassium and distinguish it from sodium, and that neural electricity results from the differential permeability of an inter-face, or cell-partition, to these elements, the inside of a cell being negatively charged, the outside positively.
Whether we call this a chemical or an electrical phenomenon is rather beside the point. There would be little profit in arguing whether a flash-lamp is an electrical or chemical device; it is more electrical than an oil lamp, more chemical than a lightning flash.
We shall frequently refer to changes of potential as electrical rhythms, cycles of polar changes, more explicitly electro-chemical changes. We shall be near the truth if we keep in mind that electrical changes in living tissue, the phenomena of animal electricity, are signs of chemical events, and that there is no way of distinguishing one from the other in the animal cell or in the mineral cell.
The current of a nerve impulse is a sort of electro-chemical smoke-ring about two inches long travelling along the nerve at a speed of as much as 300 feet per second.

The neglect and mystification which obscured Galvani&#39;s discovery, more sterile than any controversy, forced electrophysiology into an academic backwater for some decades.
A few experiments were made; for example, by Biedermann, who published a 2-volume treatise called Electrophysiology, and by Dubois-Reymond, who introduced Michael Faraday&#39;s induction coil into the physiological laboratory and the term faradisation as an alternative to galvanisation into the physiotherapist&#39;s vocabulary.
Faraday&#39;s electrical and electrifying research began in 1831, the date also of the foundation of the British Association for the Advancement of Science; but physiology long remained a backward child of the family.

Hampered though these experimenters were by lack of trustworthy equipment&emdash;they had to construct their own galvanometers from first principles&emdash;they gradually accumulated enough facts to show that all living tissue is sensitive in some degree to electric currents and, what is perhaps more important, all living tissue generates small voltages which change dramatically when the tissue is injured or becomes active.


These experiments were not concerned with the brain; they were made on frog&#39;s legs, fish eggs, electric eels and flayed vermin.
Nor could the brain be explored in that way.

<blockquote>
    Following life through creatures you dissect,
    You lose it in the moment you detect
</blockquote>

It took a war to bring the opportunity of devising a technique for exploring the human brain&emdash;and two more wars to perfect it Two medical officers of the Prussian army, wandering through the stricken field of Sedan, had the brilliant if ghoulish notion to test the effect of the Galvanic current on the exposed brains of some of the casualties.
These pioneers of 1870, Fritsch and Hitzig, found that when certain areas at the side of the brain were stimulated by the current, movements took place in the opposite side of the body.


That the brain itself produces electric currents was the discovery of an English physician, R. Caton, in 1875.


This growing nucleus of knowledge was elaborated and carried further by Ferrier in experiments with the &ldquo;Faradic current.&rdquo;
Toward the end of the century there was a spate of information which suggested that the brain of animals possessed electrical properties related to those found in nerve and muscle.
Prawdwicz-Neminski in 1913 produced what he called the &ldquo;electro-cerebrogram&rdquo; of a dog, and was the first to attempt to classify such observations.

The electrical changes in the brain, however, are minute.
The experiments of all these workers were made on the exposed brains of animals.
There were no means of amplification in those days, whereby the impulses reaching the exterior of the cranium could be observed or recorded, even if their presence had been suspected.
On the other hand, the grosser electrical currents generated by the rhythmically contracting muscles of the heart were perceptible without amplification.
Electro-cardiography became a routine clinical aid a generation before the invention of the thermionic tube made it possible to study the electrical activity of the intact human brain.

From an unexpected quarter, at the turn of the century, came an entirely new development.
Turn up the section on the brain in a pre-war textbook of physiology and you will find gleanings from clinical neuro-anatomy and&emdash;Pavlov.
Almost as if recapitulating the history of physiological ideas, Pavlov&#39;s work began below the midriff.
He found that the process of digestion could not be understood without reference to the nervous system, and so commenced his laborious study of learning in animals.

In the gospel according to Stalin, Pavlov founded not merely a branch of physiology as Galvani had done, but a whole new science&emdash;Soviet physiology.
His work indeed was original; it owed nothing to Galvani, lying quite outside electrophysiology, to which it was nevertheless eventually, though not in Pavlov&#39;s day, to contribute so much in the way of understanding.


For nearly two generations Pavlov&#39;s experiments were the major source of information on brain physiology.
Workers in the English laboratories had not permitted themselves to explore further than the top of the spinal cord.
One took an anatomical glance at the brain, and turned away in despair.
This was not accountable to any peculiar weakness of physiological tradition but to the exigencies of scientific method itself.
A discipline had been building up through the centuries which demanded that in any experiment there should be only one variable and its variations should be measurable against a controlled background.
In physiology this meant that in any experiment there should be only one thing at a time under investigation — one single function, say, of an organ&emdash;and that the changes of material or function should be measurable.
There seemed to be no possibility of isolating one single variable, one single mode of activity, among the myriad functions of the brain.
Thus there was something like a taboo against the study of the brain.
The success of Pavlov in breaking this taboo early in the century was due to his contrivance for isolating his experimental animals from all but two stimuli; his fame rests on his measurement of responses to the stimuli.


There was no easy way through the academic undergrowth of traditional electrophysiology to the electrical mechanisms underlying brain functions.
The Cambridge school of electrophysiology, under a succession of dexterous and original experimenters beginning toward the end of the last century, developed its own techniques in special fields of research, particularly in the electrical signs of activity in muscles, nerves and sense organs.
At the same time, the Oxford school under the leadership of Sherrington was beginning to unravel some of the problems of reflex function of the spinal cord.
In both these schools the procedure adopted, to comply with the traditional requirements of scientific method, was to dissect out or isolate the organ or part of an organ to be studied.
This was often carried to the extreme of isolating a single nerve fibre only a few thousandths of a millimetre in diameter, so as to eliminate all but a single functional unit.


Imagine, then, how refreshing and tantalizing were the reports from Pavlov&#39;s laboratory in Leningrad to those engaged on the meticulous dissection of invisible nerve tendrils and the analysis of the impulses which we induced them to transmit After four years spent working literally in a cage and chained by the ankle&emdash;not for punishment but for electrical screening&emdash;enlargement came when my professor of that date, the late Sir Joseph Barcroft, assigned me to establishing a laboratory in association with a visiting pupil of Pavlov, Rosenthal.
We spent a year or so on mastering the technique and improving it by the introduction of certain electronic devices.
The Russian results were confirmed.
To do more than this would have required staff and equipment far beyond the resources of the Cambridge laboratory.


Meanwhile, another major event in the history of physiology had taken place.
Berger, in 1928, at last brought Hartley&#39;s vibrations into the laboratory and with them a method which seemed to hold out the promise of an investigation of electrical brain activity as precise as were the reflex measurements of Pavlov.
When Pavlov visited England some time after we heard of this, as the English exponent of his work I had the privilege of discussing it with him on familiar terms.
Among other things, I asked him if he saw any relation between the two methods of observing cerebral activity, his method and Berger&#39;s.
The latter, I was even then beginning to suspect, might in some way provide a clue to how the conditioning of a reflex was effected in the brain.
But Pavlov showed no desire to look behind the scenes.
He was not in the least interested in the mechanism of cerebral events; they just happened, and it was the happening and its consequence that interested him, not how they happened.
Soviet physiology embalmed the body of this limited doctrine as mystically as the body of Lenin, for the foundations of their science.
The process of conditioning reflexes has a specious affinity with the Marxian syllogism. Others have found in the phenomena sufficient substantiation for a gospel of Behaviourism.

Pavlov was before his time.
He would have been a greater man, his work would have been more fertile in his lifetime, and Russian science might have been spared a labyrinthine deviation, had the work of Berger come to acknowledgement and fruition in his day.
But again there was delay; Berger waved the fairy wand in 1928; the transformation of Cinderella was a process of years.

There were reasons for this delay.
For one thing, Berger was not a physiologist and his reports were vitiated by the vagueness and variety of his claims and the desultory nature of his technique.
He was indeed a surprisingly unscientific scientist, as personal acquaintance with him later confirmed.


The first occasion on which the possibilities of clinical electroencephalography were discussed in England was quite an informal one.
It was in the old Central Pathological Laboratory at the Maudsley Hospital in London, in 1929.
The team there under Professor Golla was in some difficulty about electrical apparatus; they were trying to get some records of the &ldquo;Berger rhythm,&rdquo; using amplifiers with an old galvanometer that fused every time they switched on the current.
Golla was anxious to use the Matthews oscillograph, then the last word in robust accuracy, to measure peripheral and central conduction times.
I was still working at Cambridge under the watchful eye of Adrian and Matthews and was pleased to introduce this novelty to him and at the same time, with undergraduate superiority, put him right on a few other points.
When, at lunch around the laboratory table, he referred to the recent publication of Berger&#39;s claims, I readily declared that anybody could record a wobbly line, it was a string of artefacts, even if there were anything significant in it there was nothing you could measure, and so on.
Golla agreed with milder scepticism, but added: &ldquo;If this new apparatus is as good as you say, it should be easy to find out whether Berger&#39;s rhythm is only artefact; and if it isn&#39;t, the frequency seems remarkably constant; surely one could measure that quite accurately.&rdquo;
And he surmised that there would be variations of the rhythm in disease.


Cambridge still could not accept the brain as a proper study for the physiologist.
The wobbly line did not convince us or anybody else at that time.
Berger&#39;s &ldquo;elektrenkephalograms&rdquo; were almost completely disregarded.
His entirely original and painstaking work received little recognition until in May, 1934, Adrian and Matthews gave the first convincing demonstration of the &ldquo;Berger rhythm&rdquo; to an English audience, a meeting of the Physiological Society at Cambridge.

Meanwhile, Golla was reorganising his laboratory, and his confidence in the possibilities of the Berger method was growing.
When he invited me to join his research team as physiologist at the Central Pathological Laboratory, my first task was to visit the German laboratories, including particularly that of Hans Berger.


Berger, in 1935, was not regarded by his associates as in the front rank of German psychiatrists, having rather the reputation of being a crank.
He seemed to me to be a modest and dignified person, full of good humour, and as unperturbed by lack of recognition as he was later by the fame it eventually brought him.
But he had one fatal weakness: he was completely ignorant of the technical and physical basis of his method. He knew nothing about mechanics or electricity.
This handicap made it impossible for him to correct serious shortcomings in his experiments.
His method was a simple adaptation of the electrocardiographic technique by which the electrical impulses generated by the heart are recorded.
At first he inserted silver wires under the subject&#39;s scalp; later he used silver foil bound to the head with a rubber bandage.
Nearly always he put one electrode over the forehead and one over the back of the head; leads were taken from these to an Edelmann galvanometer, a light and sensitive &ldquo;string&rdquo; type of instrument, and records were taken by an assistant photographer.
A potential change of one-ten-thousandth of a volt&emdash;a very modest sensitivity by present standards&emdash;could just be detected by this apparatus.
Each record laboriously produced was equivalent to that of two or three seconds of modern continuous pen recording.
The line did show a wobble at about 10 cycles per second.
(See Figure 3.)
He had lately acquired a tube amplifier to drive his galvanometer, and his pride and pleasure in the sweeping excursions of line obtained by its use were endearing.

Berger carried the matter as far as his technical handicap permitted.
He had observed that the larger and more regular rhythms tended to stop when the subject opened his eyes or solved some problem in mental arithmetic.
This was confirmed by Adrian and Matthews with leads from electrodes on Adrian&#39;s head attached to a Matthews amplifier and inkwriting oscillograph.
This superior apparatus, and a more careful location of electrodes, enabled them to go a step further and prove that the 10 cycles per second rhythm arises in the visual association areas in the occiput and not, as Berger supposed, from the whole brain.


Only some years later was it realised what an important step this was.
Its significance could not be recognised while so little was known about the components of the &ldquo;wobbly line,&rdquo; the electroencephalogram or, abbreviated, EEC Unavoidably at the time, the significance of the salient character of the normal EEG was overlooked; it was found, in Adrian&#39;s phrase, &ldquo;disappointingly constant.&rdquo;
The attention of many early workers in electroencephalography therefore turned from normal research to the study of nervous disease.
In immediate rewards this has always been a rich field.
In this instance, a surprising state was soon reached wherein what might be called the electropathology of the brain was further advanced than its electrophysiology.


In the pathological laboratory, Golla&#39;s earlier surmise, that there would be variations of the rhythmic oscillation in disease, was soon verified.
A technique was developed there by which the central point of the disturbance in the tissue could be accurately determined.
For surgery, the immediate result of perfecting this technique was important; it made possible the location of tumours, brain injuries, or other physical damage to the brain.
It was helpful in many head cases during the war as well as in daily surgical practice.


The study of epilepsy and mental disorders also began to occupy the attention of many EEG workers.
The difficulties encountered in these subjects threw into prominent relief the essential complexity of the problem as compared with those of classical physiology.
The hope of isolating single functions had now been abandoned; those who entered this field were committed to studying the brain as a whole organ and through it the body as a whole organism.
They were therefore forced to multiply their sources of information.


It is now the general EEG practice, not only for clinical purposes, but in research, to use a number of electrodes simultaneously, indeed as many as possible and convenient.
The standard make of EEG recorder has eight channels.
Eight pens are simultaneously tracing lines in which the recordist, after long experience, can recognise the main components of a complex graph.
The graphs can also be automatically analysed into their component frequencies.
A more satisfactory method of watching the electrical changes in all the main areas, as in a moving picture, a much more informative convention than the drawing of lines, has been devised at the Burden Neurological Institute.
This will be described after a simple explanation of what is meant by the rhythmic composition of the normal EEG; for its nature, rather than the methods of recording and analysing it, is of first importance for understanding what follows.


If you move a pencil amply but regularly up and down on a paper that is being drawn steadily from right to left, the result will be a regular series of curves.
If at the same time the paper is moving up and down, another series of curves will be added to the line drawn. If the table is shaking, the vibration will be added to the line as a ripple.
There will then be three components integrated in the one wavy line, which will begin to look something like an EEG record.
The line gives a coded or conventional record of the various frequencies and amplitudes of different physical movements.
In similar coded or integrated fashion the EEG line reports the frequencies and amplitudes of the electrical changes in the different parts of the brain tapped by the electrodes on the scalp, their minute currents being relayed by an amplifier to the oscillograph which activates the pens.


All EEG records contain many more components than this; some may show as many as 20 or 30 at a time in significant sizes.
Actually there may be tens of thousands of impulses woven together in such a manner that only the grosser combinations are discernible.


A compound curve is of course more easily put together than taken apart.
(See Figure 4.)
The adequate analysis of a few inches of EEG records would require the painstaking computation of a mathematician&emdash;it might take him a week or so.
The modern automatic analyser in use in most laboratories writes out the values of 24 components every 10 seconds, as well as any averaging needed over longer periods.


The electrical changes which give rise to the alternating currents of variable frequency and amplitude thus recorded arise in the cells of the brain itself; there is no question of any other power supply.
The brain must be pictured as a vast aggregation of electrical cells, numerous as the stars of the Galaxy, some 10 thousand million of them, through which surge the restless tides of our electrical being relatively thousands of times more potent than the force of gravity.
It is when a million or so of these cells repeatedly fire together that the rhythm of their discharge becomes measureable in frequency and amplitude.

    Note the accidental similarity of this curve to the EEG record of alpha rhythms in Figure 3 (b).

What makes these million cells act together&emdash;or indeed what causes a single cell to discharge&emdash;is not known.
We are still a long way from any explanation of these basic mechanics of the brain.
Future research may well carry us, as it has carried the physicist in his attempt to understand the composition of our atomic being, into vistas of ever increasing enchantment but describable only in the convention of mathematical language.
Today, as we travel from one fresh vista to another, the propriety of the language we use, the convention we adopt, becomes increasingly important.
Arithmetic is an adequate language for describing the height and time of the tides, but if we want to predict their rise and fall we have to use a different language, an algebra, with its special notation and theorems.
In similar fashion, the electrical waves and tides in the brain can be described adequately by counting, by arithmetic; but there are many unknown quantities when we come to the more ambitious purposes of understanding and predicting brain behaviour&emdash;many x&#39;s and y&#39;s; so it will have to have its algebra.
The word is forbidding to some people; but, after all, it means no more than &ldquo;the putting together of broken pieces.&rdquo;

EEG records may be considered, then, as the bits and pieces of a mirror for the brain, itself speculum speculorum.
They must be carefully sorted before even trying to fit them together with bits from other sources.
Their information comes as a conventional message, coded. You may crack the code, but that does not imply that the information will necessarily be of high significance.
Supposing, for instance, you pick up a coded message which you think may be about a momentous political secret. In the first stage of decoding it you might ascertain that the order of frequency of the letters was ETAONI.
This does not sound very useful information; but reference to the letter-frequency tables would assure you at least that it was a message in English and possibly intelligible.
Likewise, we watch the frequencies as well as the amplitude and origin of the brain rhythms, knowing that many earnest seekers for the truth have spent lifetimes trying to decipher what they thought were real messages, only to find that their horoscopes and alembics contained gibberish.
The scientist is used to such hazards of research; it is only the ignorant and superstitious who regard him, or think he regards himself, as a magician or priest who is right about everything all the time.


Brain research has just about reached the stage where the letter frequencies of the code indicate intelligibility and their grouping significance.
But there is this complication.
The ordinary coded message is a sequence in time; events in the brain are not a single sequence in time&emdash;they occur in three-dimensional space, in that one bit of space which is more crowded with events than any other we can conceive.
We may tap a greater number of sectors of the brain and set more pens scribbling; but the effect of this will only be to multiply the number of code signals, to the increasing embarrassment of the observer, unless the order and inter-relation of the signals can be clarified and emphasised.
Redundancy is already a serious problem of the laboratory.


The function of a nervous system is to receive, correlate, store and generate many signals.
A human brain is a mechanism not only far more intricate than any other but one that has a long individual history.
To study such a problem in terms of frequency and amplitude as a limited function of time&emdash;in wavy lines&emdash;is at the best over-simplification.
And the redundancy is indeed enormous.
Information at the rate of about 3,600 amplitudes per minute may be coming through each of the eight channels during the average recording period of 20 minutes; so the total information in a routine record may be represented by more than half a million numbers; yet the usual description of a record consists only of a few sentences.
Only rarely does an observer use more than one-hundredth of one per cent of the available information.

&ldquo;What&#39;s in a brain that ink may character &hellip; ?&rdquo;
For combining greater clarity with greater economy, many elaborations of methods have been adopted in clinic and laboratory.
They still do not overcome the fundamental embarrassment of redundancy and the error of over-simplification, both due to the limitations of a time scale.
A promising alternative is a machine that draws a snapshot map instead of a long history, projecting the electrical data visually on a spatial co-ordinate system which can be laid out so as to represent a simple map or model of the head.
This moving panorama of the brain rhythms does approximate to Sherrington&#39;s &ldquo;enchanted loom where millions of flashing shuttles weave a dissolving pattern, always a meaningful pattern though never an abiding one.&rdquo;
( Figure 5. )

We have called the apparatus which achieves this sort of effect at the Burden Institute a toposcope, by reason of its display of topographic detail.
The equipment was developed by Harold Shipton, whose imaginative engineering transformed the early models from entertainment to education.
Two of its 24 channels are for monitoring the stimuli; the others, instead of being connected with pens, lead the electrical activity of the brain tapped by the electrodes for display on the screens of small cathode-ray tubes.
So instead of wavy lines on a moving paper, the observer sees, to quote Sherrington again, &ldquo;a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trains of travelling sparks hurrying hither and thither.&rdquo;
Assembled in the display console, 22 of the tubes give a kind of Mercator&#39;s projection of the brain.
Frequency, phase and time relations of the rhythms are shown in what at first appears to be a completely bewildering variety of patterns in each tube and in their ensemble.
Then, as the practised eye gains familiarity with the scene, many details of brain activity are seen for the first time. A conventional pen machine is simultaneously at the disposal of the observer, synchronised so that, by turning a switch, a written record of the activity seen in any five of the tubes can be made.
Another attachment is a camera with which at the same time permanent snapshot records of the display can be obtained.

Thus, from Berger&#39;s crude galvanometer to this elaborate apparatus requiring a whole room of its own, electroencephalography has progressed from a technique to a science.
Its clinical benefits, by-products of free research, are acknowledged; they can be gauged by the vast multiplication of EEG laboratories.
From Berger&#39;s lone clinic have sprung several hundred EEG centres&emdash;more than 50 in England alone.
Literally millions of yards of paper have been covered with frantic scribblings.
In every civilized country there is a special learned society devoted to the discussion of the records and to disputation on technique and theory.
These societies are banded together in an International Federation, which publishes a quarterly Journal and organises international congresses.

For a science born, as it were, bastard and neglected in infancy, this is a long way to have travelled in its first quarter of a century.
If it is to provide the mirror which the brain requires to see itself steadily and whole, there is still a long road ahead.
The following chapters give the prospect as seen from the present milestone, assuming that such studies are allowed to continue.
Looking back, we realise that the present scale of work as compared with previous physiological research is elaborate and expensive.
But our annual cost of conducting planned investigations of a fundamental nature into man&#39;s supreme faculties is less than half that of one medium tank, and the money spent on brain research in all England is barely one-tenth of one per cent of the cost of the national mental health services.
