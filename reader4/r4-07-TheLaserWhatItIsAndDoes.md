### Introduction

In 1960, electronics scientists and engineers began to see things in a different light.

It was a rich ruby light: not &ldquo;kindled in the vine,&rdquo; as the Persian poet Omar Khayyam said, but emitted by the atoms of a synthetic gem stone.

The light came from the laser, a new device with wide potential application in science, medicine, industry, and national defense.

### what&#39;s in a name?

The word laser is an acronym, or a word made up of the first letters of several other words.
Laser stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
It was coined by analogy with another acronym: maser. Maser stands for Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.

The maser works on the same basic principle as the laser but, of course, emits microwave energy rather than light.
Masers are used as input amplifiers ( preamplifiers ) of radio telescopes and space-tracking receivers that magnify feeble signals gleaned from outer space.

No one is completely satisfied with the name &ldquo;laser&rdquo; because lasers do not really amplify light in a strict sense; instead they generate light with particular characteristics that engineers and scientists find useful.
In electronics terminology a device that generates radiation is called an oscillator, not an amplifier.


Furthermore, most lasers do not emit visible light at all but rather infrared, or invisible, light.
It is conceivable that devices working on the same principle as the laser and maser may someday emit ultraviolet or so-called black light, X rays, or even gamma rays.

Scientists who moved from maser research into laser research insist on calling the laser an optical maser.
But it can be argued that it is ridiculous to talk of &ldquo;optical microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation&rdquo; since &ldquo;optical&rdquo; means one thing and &ldquo;microwave&rdquo; quite another.

Proponents of the term &ldquo;optical maser&rdquo; counter by saying that &ldquo;maser&rdquo; doesn&#39;t stand for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation at all, but rather for molecular amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.

To the comment that masers do not amplify molecules comes the answer that they depend for their action on the behavior of the molecules of the substance.

Well, some masers and lasers do depend on molecular effects.
But more depend on the behavior of submolecular particles: atoms, ions (atoms that have lost one or more electrons), perhaps even electrons themselves.


Recently the term quantum device has been applied to both masers and lasers, and this seems to make sense, since the action of both the laser and the maser can be explained by the science of quantum mechanics.
In fact, some scientists and engineers interested in lasers and masers are attempting to form within the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers a professional group on quantum electronics.
And though for the present the term &ldquo;laser&rdquo; seems deeply ingrained in the scientific vocabulary, let&#39;s remember that the science we call electronics was once known as thermionic engineering!

### what&#39;s special about a laser?

The important thing about laser light is that it is coherent.
The individual light rays are all of the same wavelength or color, and are all in step.
A laser beam differs from a beam of ordinary light in both character and effectiveness in the same way that a platoon of well-drilled soldiers differs from a ragtag, disorganized mob.


When light waves from a laser march in step, they can perform amazing feats.
The reason is that their energy is not dissipated as the beam spreads out.
This makes for an intense concentration of energy at a very sharply defined point.
It also greatly extends the range of a light source.

Three of the many spectacular achievements of the laser demonstrate how the properties of coherent light can be put to work:

• Because its light does not spread out even at great distances, a laser can illuminate the surface of the moon with a two-mile- wide circle of light.


<figure>
\caption{Laser beam on moon (black dot) compared with area of radar beam (shaded area) (Raytheon)}
</figure>

• Because its energy is concentrated at a fine point, it can send a short, searing pinpoint of light into the human eyeball to weld a detached retina back into place and restore sight.

• And since its radiation is so intense, it can burn holes in a steel plate Ys inch thick at a distance of several feet.

These abilities have given rise to a whole range of applications.
Laser range finders are used both by artillery officers to sight their guns and by surveyors.
In outer space, where there is no atmosphere to absorb the light, the laser will supplement conventional radar and radio for space-vehicle navigation and communications.

Lasers can cut metal and other materials.
But it is highly unlikely that a laser will ever replace an engine lathe or an oxyacetelene torch in most machining and metal-cutting operations.
Lasers are being used in the precision machining of metals and in machining brittle materials such as diamonds.


A laser can weld metals as well as retinas.
But here, too, its use is for precise work, as in making microelectronic circuits.
Nevertheless, large lasers mounted atop high mountain peaks are being developed to provide a defense against intercontinental-ballistic-missile warheads.


To the scientist, the laser is already a valuable tool in absorption spectroscopy or the identification of compounds by the particular wavelengths of light that they absorb.

### Radiant Energy

How can a beam of light burn a hole in a steel plate?
It can do so because light is a form of radiant energy, and a laser concentrates much radiant energy in a very tiny spot.
Radiant energy exists in many forms besides visible light.
It exists as radio waves, ultraviolet and infrared light, X rays, gamma rays, and even cosmic rays.


### Wavelength and Frequency

It is sometimes convenient to think of radiant energy as waves, that is, electromagnetic waves.
Then the different forms of radiant energy can be classified by their wavelengths and arranged according to wavelength in a spectrum.
We have all seen the waves made by a pebble thrown into a quiet pond.
They are a series of alternating crests and troughs.
The wavelength is defined as the distance between two adjacent crests or two adjacent troughs.

Now, when a wave goes from crest to trough and back to crest again, it is said to have gone through one cycle, or alternation.
The number of cycles that a wave executes in one second is known as the frequency of the wave.


Light waves and all other electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed, which is 186,000&nbsp;miles, or 300,000,000&nbsp;meters, a second.
All scientific measurements are made in metric system.
In the metric system the basic unit of length is the meter&emdash;a little over three feet.

### Radio Spectrum

The alternating current supplied by the power company is an electromagnetic wave that executes 60 cycles a second; thus, in 1/60 of a second, or the time of one alternation, the wave will travel 300,000,000/60, or 5,000,000&nbsp;meters&emdash;roughly the distance from New York to Los Angeles.
The electromagnetic spectrum arranges the different kinds of electromagnetic energy according to decreasing wavelength.

Everyone is familiar with the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet spectrum of the rainbow after a spring shower.
The same separation of white light into its color components occurs when we pass light through a glass prism.
A spectrum arranges the frequency components of white light according to decreasing wavelengths.
Similar spectra exist in the infrared and ultraviolet regions, but we can&#39;t see them.
They can, however, be photographed by using special film.
Radio waves also form part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

<figure>
\caption{Electromagnetic spectrum from radio frequencies to X rays (Hughes)}
</figure>

A radio broadcasting station with a frequency of 1,000&nbsp;kilocycles&nbsp;per&nbsp;second (or cycles per second times 1,000) has a wave 300&nbsp;&nbsp;meters long.
A radar set used for navigation at sea has a wavelength of about 10&nbsp;centimeters (one centimeter equals 1/100&nbsp;meter), or approximately 4 inches.

### Visible Spectrum and Infrared

Radiant energy is invisible to the human eye only until we get to a wavelength of 0.00000075&nbsp;meter, which we see as red light.
Since the meter is an ungainly unit for measuring wavelengths of light, physicists use what is called the angstrom unit, abbreviated &Aring;.
One angstrom equals 1/10,000,000,000&nbsp;meter.
Therefore we can say the visible spectrum extends from 7,500&nbsp;&Aring; (deep red) to 4,000&nbsp;&Aring;, or blue.
In between are regions of orange (about 6,000&nbsp;&Aring;), yellow (about 5,900&nbsp;&Aring;), and green (about 5,300&nbsp;&Aring;).

The visible spectrum is bounded by longer waves of infrared that we sense as heat.
For example, a jet engine exhaust has a wavelength of 40,000&nbsp;&Aring;, while the heat of the human body has a wavelength of about 99,000&nbsp;&Aring;.

### From Sun Tans to Cosmic Rays

The short wavelength, or blue end of the spectrum, is bounded by the ultraviolet region.
Sun-tanning ultraviolet rays have a wavelength of about 3,000&nbsp;&Aring;.
Still shorter are X rays (150 to 10 &Aring;) and gamma rays (1.4 to 0.1 &Aring;).
Gamma rays are associated with nuclear reactions, and account for some of the deadly effects of atomic and hydrogen bombs and of radioactive waste materials.
At the high end of the spectrum are cosmic rays (0.01 to 0.001 &Aring;), those weird visitors from outer space whose effects (they can cause biological mutations) are awesome indeed but about which very little is understood.

Scientists have known for a long time that the energy of radiation is proportional to its frequency.
We cannot sense the presence of radio waves even though we stand close by the antenna of a powerful broadcasting station.
Yet if we put a hand in front of a radar antenna, we may feel a slight sensation of warmth.
The energy of ultraviolet waves will become painfully evident to some who sun bathe not wisely but too well.
The penetrating power of X rays and gamma rays makes them useful for making shadowgraphs of the human skeleton and internal organs for medical diagnosis and for inspecting manufactured parts for hidden flaws.
Indeed, hard, or short, X rays and gamma rays are used to destroy malignant tissue in the treatment of cancer and related diseases.


The energy of each wavelet of radiation is called a &ldquo;quantum.&rdquo;
It is measured by the frequency of the radiation multiplied by Planck&#39;s constant (this is equal to 6.625 &times; 10<sup>&minus;27</sup> erg per second&emdash;26 zeros in front of the first 6).
The intensity of a source of radiation depends upon the number of quanta emitted from it that pass a designated boundary at a given time.

### Fluorescence

The action of the laser is allied to another, more familiar, phenomenon, that of fluorescence.
Fluorescence is said to occur when radiant energy hits the atoms or molecules of some particular material and in turn causes that substance to emit further radiant energy.
Fluorescence has this important property: the emitted radiation is always at a lower frequency (longer wavelength) than the initial radiation.


Here&#39;s how scientists explain fluorescence: Every atom and molecule has certain energy states that it can occupy.
When the atoms absorb energy, they move to higher energy states.
Conversely, when they return to lower energy states, they give up energy, or emit radiation.


Imagine an atom to be a coil spring.
When there is no compression on the spring, it is in its ground, or rest, state.
When you compress the spring, you add potential energy to the system.
When you release the spring, it bounces back and vibrates, giving up what is called its kinetic energy.


In the picture tube of your television set, electrons bombard a phosphor screen on the back of the faceplate.
The kinetic energy, or energy of motion of the rapidly moving electrons, excites the atoms of the phosphor.
As these atoms relax, the faceplate of the picture tube glows, and you see the television program because of fluorescence.


When a radiologist examines you with a fluoroscope, X-rays penetrate your body and excite the atoms of a phosphor screen.
As the atoms of the phosphor coating relax, the fluoroscope screen glows green, producing a shadowgraph of the part of the body being visualized.


In a neon sign, an alternating current creates an electromagnetic field that agitates the molecules of neon gas filling the tube.
Because collisions of rapidly moving neon molecules raise these molecules to higher energy levels, they relax, emitting the orange-red glow characteristic of a neon sign.

Of course, the common fluorescent lamp works on the same principle of energy exchange.
The inner walls of the lamp tube are coated with beryllium oxide.
Inside the tube, there is an intense arc discharge between electrodes at either end of the lamp tube.
This arc discharge is rich in ultraviolet light that energizes the phosphor molecules.
As these molecules relax, the lamp emits a blue-white light similar to natural daylight.


We now have seen several examples of quantum energy exchanges, but no one ever burned a hole in a steel plate or illuminated the moon with a neon sign or with a fluorescent lamp.
What, then, does the laser have that its less powerful cousins lack?

### Frequency Coherence

The answer is: the laser&#39;s coherence.
In all the previous examples of the phenomenon of fluorescence, the emitted radiation had a broad spectrum.
Because it was emitted in random fashion, some wavelets added together while others opposed each other.


Frequency coherence makes a big difference.
It means that all the emitted energy has the same wavelength.
When this happens, you can have a useful output indeed.
Take the babble of voices at a cocktail party as an example of incoherent sound.
The sound doesn&#39;t carry very far and it is not especially meaningful.
But if you were to concentrate all that sound energy into the blast of a police whistle or siren, you could awaken half a city.

<figure>
\caption{Frequency coherent radiation, top, and frequency incoherent radiation, bottom (Raytheon)}
</figure>

Engineers learned many years ago that they could communicate more efficiently and more meaningfully when they concentrated all the output of a radio transmitter at a single frequency.
But frequency coherence has other advantages besides efficiency.
A beam of coherent light can be modulated much as a radio signal can be.
Modulation is a process by which intelligence such as music or speech is impressed upon a so-called carrier signal such as a radio wave.

An incoherent light beam can be modulated in only the most elementary manner&emdash;such as by switching it on and off, as with the visual blinker lights used to send Morse code between ships.
But the frequency-coherent laser beam can be modulated by such complex signals as speech, music, or even a television picture.


Frequency-coherent light also lends itself to frequency multiplication, the technique whereby a closely controlled but relatively low radio frequency can be raised to a higher output frequency.
The output of a rubv laser at 6,943&nbsp;&Aring; has been doubled to 3,472&nbsp;&Aring;.
The input was deep red and the output blue-violet, almost ultraviolet.
The reason the wavelengths of laser light are given so precisely is that the emission of laser light depends on the shifting of electrons between atomic orbits, and each wavelength is characteristic of one particular orbital shift, or so-called quantum jump.

Laser beams can also be mixed.
For example, a ruby laser operates in two slightly different modes.
These modes can be mixed in a microwave phototube.
The frequency difference between the modes yields a microwave signal that can be handled by conventional radio or television techniques.
This property has permitted some engineers to modulate laser beams with television pictures and to recover the television signal after transmission for several feet.

Scientists find the frequency coherence of the laser especially gratifying.
Before the discovery of the laser, only signals in the lower, or radio, end of the spectrum could be produced coherently.
Radio techniques were limited to producing signals whose wavelength was on the order of a millimeter or so.


If monochromatic (or single-frequency) signals were desired anywhere else in the spectrum, they had to be produced by placing an appropriate filter in front of an incoherent source.
This method was unsatisfactory for two reasons: it was very inefficient, since the source had to produce many times the energy that could be usefully employed; and, second, since no filtered output is ever truly coherent, modulation, frequency multiplication, and mixing were always unsatisfactory.
But now a whole new section of the spectrum, ranging from the &ldquo;near&rdquo; (to visible light, that is) infrared to near ultraviolet, is open to investigation, and there is evidence that the existing gaps at the high and low ends of this laser operating range can be filled by using related techniques.

### Spatial Coherence

Frequency coherence is only part of the picture.
The output of a laser is also spatially coherent.
This means that all wavelets start in step with each other.
Spatial coherence also adds to the efficiency of a device.
The difference between spatial incoherence and spatial coherence is like the difference between a disorganized group of castaways of a raft each paddling in his own way and the smooth, efficient performance of a well-trained crew rowing an eight-oared racing shell.

<figure>

### Ruby Lasers

The ruby laser was the first device to generate coherent light successfully.
The rubies used in lasers are synthetic gem stones.
They are made by fusing aluminum and chromium oxides to produce large crystals.
The amount of chromium in a synthetic ruby is small&emdash;about five hundredths of 1 percent.
But it is that chromium upon which laser action depends.


The ruby crystal is cylindrical, about $\frac{1}{4}$ inch in diameter and $1\frac{1}{2}$ to 2 inches long. It appears pink to the eye.
That is because there are two absorption bands in a ruby&emdash;one at 5,600&nbsp;&Aring; and the other at 4,100&nbsp;&Aring;&emdash;which means that when you hold a ruby up to the light, yellow-green light and blue light are absorbed.
This subtraction of yellow, green, and blue from white light (which is a mixture of all colors) gives the remaining light transmitted to the eye its distinctive pink hue.
Actually, there is also some natural fluorescence in a ruby, but it is all but imperceptible to the eye.


A laser crystal must be polished to optical flatness on both ends.
Both ends are also silvered, one with a heavy coat while the other, or output end, is lightly silvered with a coat that permits it to reflect only about 92 percent of light incident on it.

<figure>
\caption{Exploded view of ruby laser showing ruby, mirrors, and helical flashtube (Hughes)}
</figure>


The ruby rod is now placed within a helical-shaped xenon flashtube, the kind of tube widely used in electronic flash attachments for cameras.
The process of irradiating the ruby rod with a xenon flashtube is called optical pumping.
The output of the flash lamp is rich in the yellow-green region.


The energy level of an atom (an ion is just an atom that has lost one or more electrons) depends upon the condition of its electrons.
Now, an atom is like a miniature solar system.
It has a positive nucleus at its center in place of the sun, and a specific number of planet-like electrons.
These electrons revolve around the nucleus and spin on their own axes.
Unlike the planets of the solar system, however, each electron can occupy not just one but several orbits.
Moreover, the electrons can revolve around the nucleus with different azimuthal momenta (speed) and even change their direction of spin.
Each change in orbit, momentum, or spin corresponds to a discrete energy level.


For example, when energy is imparted to an atom, an electron may move to an orbit more remote from the nucleus.
The atom is said to absorb energy and to have been raised to a higher or more excited energy state or level. If the electron then returns to its original orbit, the atom gives up energy; it may now emit light of a certain precise wavelength.
The atom is said to relax to a lower or less excited energy state or level.
When light wavelets, or photons, at 5,600&nbsp;&Aring; from the flashtube irradiate the ruby rod, they raise the energy of some of the chromium ions dissolved in the ruby from ground state (1) to various levels lying within the absorption band.
Then the chromium ions immediately begin to drop from these higher energy levels.
Some drop right back to the ground state&emdash;level (1)&emdash;as they do in natural fluorescence.
But others drop to an intermediate or so-called metastable state (2).
If left alone, the latter chromium ions would continue their drop to level (1), and the result would just be natural fluorescence.
But these ions dally for a short but measurable time in level (2), and this is what makes laser action possible.

<figure>
\caption{Energy level transitions in a ruby laser as described in text (A); lowlevel pumping (B) and high-level pumping (C) showing how latter mode concentrates energy at one wavelength (Electronics)}
</figure>


While the chromium ions are trying to get back to level (1), the flashtube keeps on irradiating more chromium ions.
In fact, the two-step movement from state (1) to state (3) and down to state (2) is much faster than the movement from state (2) to state (1).
Thus there develops a chromiumion traffic jam at energy level (2).

### Stimulated Emission

As the pile-up of chromium ions in level (2) continues, another situation develops: soon there are more chromium ions in level (2) than in level (1).
This is called population inversion, and is essential for laser action.

When you have inversion of the chromium ion population, the laser resembles a spring that is wound up and cocked.
It needs a key to release it.
This is what is meant by stimulated emission of radiation: the stimulus is the key that releases the cocked spring.


The key is a photon of light of exactly the wavelength to be emitted (6,943&nbsp;&Aring;).
Emission begins when a random chromium ion spontaneously falls from level (2) to level (1) emitting a photon at 6,943&nbsp;&Aring;.
The photon strikes neighboring metastable (level (2)) ions, causing them to emit additional photons, and these in turn trigger other metastable ions.

As the photons travel along the rod, some emerge from the sides of the cylinder and are lost.
Others hit the silvered ends of the cylinder and are reflected back into the rod.
The reflections tend to favor those photons that are traveling parallel to the long axis of the cylinder.
And so, there is now a stream of photons bouncing back and forth between the silvered ends of the cylinder.
The photons become more numerous, and consequently the light beam grows more intense as the photons already in the stream trigger still more metastable chromium ions into emitting their radiation.

<figure>

    Photons emitted parallel to sides bounce back and forth between mirrors triggering other atoms (E) until light pulse (F) bursts from slightly transparent end (Electronics)
}
</figure>

Eventually the photon stream builds up sufficient intensity so that it bursts from the partially silvered end of the ruby as a single pulse of monochromatic (single color or frequency), spatially coherent light.

### Parallel Rays

The light beams coming out of the partially silvered end of the ruby rod are almost exactly parallel, and it is this factor that makes it possible for a laser beam to reach the moon.
Conventional light sources such as an incandescent lamp are point sources: their light rays are emitted in a spherical pattern.
Conventional rays can be made parallel by use of focusing mirrors and lenses, but such optical systems are far from efficient: the light beam diverges, and consequently loses its intensity at great distances.
But since the beams coming from a laser are parallel to begin with, they remain essentially parallel even at exceedingly great distances.

### Liquid and Plastic Lasers

The ruby laser was the first laser, but today it is only one member of the class of optically pumped lasers.
Furthermore, there are many varieties of ruby lasers.
The original ruby lasers worked at room temperature.
Later devices have been designed to work at cryogenic temperatures, or temperatures close to absolute zero ($-273$ degrees centigrade).
Cryogenic temperatures are usually achieved by immersing the laser in liquid nitrogen or liquid helium.
Lasers cooled this way can put out a continuous beam of coherent light instead of a series of flashes.


Other optically pumped lasers include many different crystalline materials, most of which are doped: made impure by the infusion of small quantities of some other material&emdash;either a rare-earth element, such as europium or neodymium, or an actinide element&emdash;a class of heavy metals that includes uranium.
Some optically pumped lasers have been made of doped glass (glass to which impurities have been added), of liquid or gas in a quartz cavity or of bundles of plastic fibers.

### Gaseous Lasers

The gaseous laser represents a second general class of laser.
The working medium is a mixture of helium and neon gas at very low pressure (0.1 millimeter of mercury of neon and 1.0 millimeter of mercury of helium).
The gas is contained in a cylindrical Pyrex tube about one meter long and 17 millimeters in diameter.
At each end of the tube is a quartz plate ground optically flat and with a 13-layer dielectric (or electrically nonconductive ) coating on its inner face: this coating produces the same effect as the lightly silvered end of the ruby rod.
The spacing of the quartz-plate mirrors can be changed with precision for optimum internal reflection, thanks to an arrangement known as a Fabrtj-Perot interferometer.
The laser beam is emitted from both ends of the apparatus.

<figure>
\caption{Helium-neon gas laser (Raytheon)}
</figure>


### Electrical Pumping

The gas laser is not optically pumped, nor is it pulsed at the rate of three or four times a second as is the ruby laser.
Instead it operates in a continuous-wave mode, its excitation supplied by a radio-frequency field&emdash;though in some gas lasers, direct current has been used to produce the required discharge.
In a typical gas laser the source is a 50-watt transmitter operating on a carrier frequency of 29 megacycles per second.
This frequency was selected simply because it lies within a band provided by the Federal Communications Commission for industrial, scientific, and medical use; another frequency would do equally well.
The transmitter is coupled to the gas tube by three metal loops.


The radio-frequency generator produces an electrical discharge through the gas that raises the helium gas atoms to an excited state designated as the $2^2S$ state.
This is a metastable state that the helium atoms retain for a finite period of time.

When the helium metastables collide with neon atoms in the ground state, the helium atoms transfer their energy to the neon atoms and drop immediately to the ground state.
Simultaneously, the neon atoms are raised to the so-called <span class="math">2s</span> state because the energy level of the <span class="math">2s</span> state in neon is nearly equal to the energy level of the $2^3S$ state in helium.


<figure>
\caption{Energy levels in a helium-neon laser (Electronics)}
</figure>


There are three excited states in neon that are involved in this reaction: the <span class="math">2s</span>, <span class="math">2p</span>, and is states.
We are primarily interested in the transition between the <span class="math">2s</span> (higher) and <span class="math">2p</span> (lower) states.
The <span class="math">2s</span> state is a metastable state.
Actually, there are four substates in the <span class="math">2s</span> band and ten substates in the <span class="math">2p</span> band.
Theoretically there are 30 possible transitions, or downward changes in energy level, that could occur, with each giving off radiation at its characteristic wavelength.
Actually, only five of these transitions have as yet figured importantly in stimulated emissions; all correspond to wavelengths in the near-infrared region.
The strongest of these emissions is one at 11,530&nbsp;&Aring;.

As in the case of the ruby laser, neon atoms tend to pile up in the <span class="math">2s</span> state, and the threshold energy is the amount of input energy that makes the population of neon atoms in the <span class="math">2S</span> state equal to that in the <span class="math">2p</span> state.
When some random neon atom spontaneously makes the transition from the 2s state to the <span class="math">2p</span> state, radiation at 11,530&nbsp;&Aring; stimulates coherent emission.

The photon at 11,530&nbsp;&Aring; stimulates nearby metastable neon atoms, and they, too, go down the chute and emit their photons at the same wavelength.
Photons emitted perpendicular to the Fabry-Perot mirrors bounce back and forth between the mirrors until they acquire sufficient intensity to break out.
Photons emitted in other directions are lost through the walls of the tube and do not participate in coherent emission.


When in operation, a gas laser is bathed in an orangered glow, but this light has nothing to do with its laser action.
Most of the coherent output of the gas laser is in the infrared region and is invisible to the eye.
The visible glow results from spontaneous transitions of excited neon atoms that do not enter into the stimulated emission of radiation.
In fact, the glow is identical to that of any neon sign.

### Injection Lasers

The third basic type of laser is the injection laser.
An injection laser consists of a semiconductor diode made of gallium arsenide or of gallium arsenide-phosphide.


A diode is an electronic part that has the property of conducting current easily in one direction but almost not at all in the opposite or reverse direction.
The injection laser is a forward-biased semiconductor diode.
It conducts current in its easy direction.

A semiconductor is a material that does not conduct electricity so well as something like copper does, but does so better than an insulator such as sulphur.
The most common semiconductors are the metals silicon and germanium, but some compounds can also be used, and, for the injection laser, gallium arsenide has proved useful.
Because gallium is a little better conductor than silicon, and arsenic a little poorer, when mixed together they give roughly the same effect as silicon.


Now, to make a diode out of a block of semiconductor material, it is necessary to dope it.
This is done by allowing the two impurities&emdash;tellurium and zinc&emdash;to diffuse into the block at high temperature.
Because the tellurium atom has one more valence (combining) electron than does arsenic, when tellurium atoms replace some of the arsenic atoms in the gallium-arsenic block, there are a few free electrons left over.
Since the electron has a negative charge, tellurium-doped gallium arsenide is called N-type, or negative, gallium arsenide.


Because zinc, on the other hand, has one less valence electron than gallium, when some zinc atoms replace a few of the gallium atoms, there are several holes, or electron deficiencies, left over.
Therefore, zinc-doped gallium arsenide is called P-type, or positive, gallium arsenide.


The boundary where the regions of N-type and P-type gallium arsenide meet is called the semiconductor junction.
If you connect the positive terminal of a battery or electronic power supply to the P-type region of a semiconductor diode and connect the negative terminal to the N-type region, the diode will be biased in the forward direction, and current will flow easily across the semiconductor junction.
If the power supply is connected with its negative terminal going to the P-region and its positive terminal going to the N-region, the diode will be biased in its reverse direction, and little, if any, current will flow across the semiconductor junction.


### How does it Work?

Scientists are not yet sure just what energy transitions occur in the injection laser.
But laser action seems to be most pronounced on the P-side of the junction.
This might indicate that some energetic electrons making up the current flowing across the junction recombine with holes and give up energy in the recombination process.

The injection laser emits coherent light by passing extremely high current between the terminals of the semiconductor diode, so that light is emitted along the line that defines the semiconductor junction.
The light comes out incoherently at first, but as the intensity of the current is increased, the emission becomes coherent.
Of course, all this electrical current passing through the relatively small diode makes the diode heat up rapidly.
Since such extreme heating could destroy the semiconductor junction, before the diode is operated it is usually immersed in a cryostat, or double bottle, the inner bottle filled with liquid helium and the outer one with liquid nitrogen.
Furthermore, the current is usually pulsed rather than passed continuously.

<figure>
\caption{Semiconductor injection laser design as developed by IBM (Electronics)}
</figure>


A typical injection laser is a rectangular parallelopiped (six-sided solid block whose opposite faces are parallel) about ten times as long as it is wide.
Dimensions of a typical unit are $\frac{1}{10}$ by $\frac{1}{10}$ by $1\frac{1}{4}$ millimeters.
The sides are finely polished and tend to reflect light back into the laser so that the emission of coherent light comes out in parallel rays from the square sides of the block.
Silvering is not required because the block itself is metallic, and when its sides are polished they will reflect the light rays generated within the block.


Current is applied to opposite rectangular sides of the block.
The current flow is perpendicular to the semiconductor junction, which is a narrow plane or region cutting the block along its long axis.


The reflection of waves at the polished sides of the diode tends to favor the waves coming out of the square ends parallel to the junction.
Furthermore, since the recombination process takes place all along the semiconductor junction plane, coherent-light waves traveling along the junction stimulate radiation from other hole-electron pairs, and the wave grows in intensity before it bursts from the square sides of the laser.


A gallium-arsenide laser emits coherent light at 8,400&nbsp;&Aring; in the near-infrared region.
This light is invisible to the human eye.
Gallium arsenide-phosphide lasers have emitted coherent light at 7,000&nbsp;&Aring;, in the deep-red region.
Furthermore, by varying the amount of phosphorus in the laser, the color can be changed throughout the nearinfrared and deep-red regions of the spectrum.
Several other intermetallic compounds involving indium and antimony as well as gallium, arsenic, and phosphorus show promise of producing laser action.
A silicon-carbide diode was reported to have emitted blue-violet light, but proof of this accomplishment is as yet inconclusive.


The current passed through the particular laser we have described may vary from 10 to 25 amperes or more.
At lower currents, the emission is incoherent and involves only a small part of the junction area.
As current is increased, the area of incoherent sparkling or sporadic emission of light spreads out along the junction, and coherent emission can be noticed near the center of the junction.

### Comparison

Thus there are three main types of lasers: optically pumped lasers, which may be crystalline, glass, liquid, gaseous, or plastic; radio-frequency or direct-current-pumped gas lasers; and semiconductor diode lasers pumped by injection of high current.

### Gaseous Lasers

The gas laser emits coherent light, usually in the infrared region.
Gas lasers are used mostly in scientific investigations, such as spectroscopy, and for experiments in space and time, such as verification of some of the consequences of the theory of relativity.
The gas laser is useful in these investigations because its output is the most nearly coherent of all lasers and because continuous output is conveniently available from gas lasers even at room temperature.

Because gaseous lasers operate in the continuous wave mode rather than through pulsation, they have proved better than optically pumped lasers for many communications experiments, such as the transmission of speech and music or television pictures.


Furthermore, since gas lasers produce the most nearly coherent output of any laser&emdash;the only thing that can cause a helium-neon gas laser to deviate from its 11,530&nbsp;&Aring; center frequency is mechanical vibration of the apparatus&emdash;they have been used for scientific studies, such as checking the experimental evidence of Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity and for constructing a precise gyroscope.

### Optically pumped lasers

Optically pumped lasers are used when high energy is required, such as for burning metal, performing delicate eye operations, precision welding or machining.
The most used optically pumped laser is still the ruby laser.
It is one of the few lasers that can give visible output.
Nearly all gas lasers, and most types of optically pumped lasers, work in the infrared region.
Most optically pumped lasers emit pulses at a relatively low repetition rate.
Continuous output can be achieved only by putting the laser in a cryostat, or double bottle of liquid helium and nitrogen.
Although the physical form of a ruby laser is simpler than that of a gas laser, its excitation system is somewhat more complex.
The gas laser needs only a simple radio transmitter, while the ruby laser requires an electronic flashgun and either a special xenon flashtube or a carefully designed system of reflectors.

### Injection Lasers

The injection laser is physically simpler than either the ruby or gas laser.
For excitation, it actually needs only a rudimentary direct-current power supply, but it is usually operated in a cryostat.
Injection lasers can produce a whole range of coherent output frequencies within the red and infrared regions of the spectrum.
They deliver continuous or nearly continuous output, and they, too, have been found useful in communications experiments in which speech, music, or even television pictures have been transmitted.
Gallium-arsenide diodes operated at lower current and at room temperature are already being used in portable communications systems.
Although the infrared output of these devices is not coherent, they have permitted communications over a range of thirty miles.

### Universal Coherence

Sciences have long dreamed of generating coherent emission at all frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Quantum devices have made important contributions toward this end, but a great deal remains to be done.
It has been suggested that variations of the word &ldquo;maser&rdquo; be coined for all the new devices, including the ones yet to come.
There might be rasers (radio-frequency), masers (microwave), irasers (infrared), lasers (Zight), uuasers (ultraviolet), xasers (X ray), and gasers (gamma-ray).
One prominent scientist jocularly suggested the name &ldquo;daser,&rdquo; standing for &ldquo;darkness amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.&rdquo;

All this points up the advantage of talking about quantum devices (and specifying whether they are oscillators, amplifiers, or harmonic generators) and designating the wavelength of interest rather than playing with acronyms.
It does, nevertheless, seem to be a fact of life that the term &ldquo;maser&rdquo; will continue to be used both for amplifiers and for oscillators not only in the microwave region (roughly 1,000&nbsp;megacycles per second) but perhaps for devices operating at even lower frequencies, when and if such devices are developed.

Likewise, it seems that the term &ldquo;laser&rdquo; will continue to be used to refer both to amplifiers and to oscillators that operate in the near-infrared, visible, and near-ultraviolet portions of the spectrum.
Neither extension of laser action into the far-infrared (near microwaves) nor into the farultraviolet (near X rays) will result in a change in terminology.

But possibly, when we can successfully generate coherent X rays and gamma rays, another term will be used, for already, as mentioned above, the word &ldquo;gaser&rdquo; is being bandied about.

### Masers

Masers are usually true amplifiers instead of the generators that lasers are.
This means that they receive a weak signal and pass it on at a higher power level.
Masers operate between 300&nbsp;megacycles per second ( 100 centimeters or 1 meter wavelength) and 100,000&nbsp;megacycles per second (3&nbsp;millimeters).

We might remark parenthetically that there is other millimeter-wave research going on that does not involve masers.
One special microwave tube, the Tornadotron, has been reported to have an output of 500,000&nbsp;megacycles per second, or a wavelength of 0.6&nbsp;millimeter.
A typical maser consists of a crystal containing chromium that is pumped by the output of a microwave tube operating at a frequency much higher than the one to be received.
The microwave signal pumps the chromium ions to an elevated energy level that is metastable.

Incoming signals at a certain lower microwave frequency stimulate the chromium ions to fall from their elevated energy level to an intermediate level before the ground state.
In so doing, they emit radiation at the frequency of the incoming signal and thus amplify it.

To avoid the introduction of noise or unwanted signals, maser amplifiers are placed between the pole pieces of a powerful magnet, and are operated in a double bottle with liquid helium on the inside and liquid nitrogen on the outside.

About a dozen radio astronomical observatories throughout the world use maser amplifiers to pick up radio-frequency emissions from distant planets, stars, and nebulae.
Several stations use maser amplifiers for tracking satellites and space probes.
So do some of the stations that receive radio and television signals from orbiting communications satellites such as Telstar and Relay.
It is possible that maser amplifiers are used in special military radar and communications applications, but if so, the Department of Defense isn&#39;t saying!

### Infrared Lasers (irasers)

Various kinds of lasers cover the near-infrared spectrum from nearly 13,000&nbsp;&Aring; right up to visible light.
This leaves a gap in the spectrum from 3&nbsp;millimeters wavelength to 0.013&nbsp;millimeter.
This gap includes the millimeter and submillimeter-wave regions of the radio spectrum and the far-infrared band that encompasses radiation from warm and lukewarm objects.

### New colors in lasers

Progress has not been so good in the visible region.
Only a few lasers produce visible light, and most of that, as we have noted, is deep red.
There is, of course, the ruby laser.
Red light has been produced by several other methods as well: by a laser consisting of a crystal of calcium fluoride with the rare-earth samarium dissolved in it; from europium chelate (rhymes with &ldquo;tea late&rdquo;) embedded in a plastic tube (a chelate is a complex organic or hydrocarbon molecule containing a metal atom, in this case an atom of the rare-earth europium); with the gallium arsenide-phosphide laser; and with some helium-neon gas lasers.

There is a demand for lasers to produce other colors besides red.
The Navy would like to have a blue-green laser because blue-green light is best for penetrating seawater and because a blue-green laser could be used as part of an underwater television system to help navigators of nuclear submarines detect the presence of friendly or hostile submarines or other underwater objects.

So far, the only progress in that direction has been the development of &ldquo;blue-violet lasers,&rdquo; produced by doubling the output frequency of a deep-red laser.
(Doubling the output frequency is the same thing as dividing the wavelength by two.)
Likewise, there are &ldquo;green lasers,&rdquo; achieved by doubling the output frequency of lasers operating in the near-infrared region.

But when you double the output frequency of a laser, you lose $\frac{8}{10}$ or more of its energy, and what&#39;s left will hardly perform the job the Navy has in mind.
Therefore the search for different colored lasers continues, with scientists now studying not only rare-earth and actinide metals but even various organic compounds.
They feel that, given the right conditions, any substance that will fluoresce can be made to lase.
This leaves them with thousands of compounds to investigate.

### Ultraviolet Lasers (uvasers)

So far the story of the ultraviolet laser is short and sweet.
One optically pumped laser, using a glass rod in which a small quantity of the rare-earth gadolinium has been dissolved, lases at 3,125&nbsp;&Aring; in the near ultraviolet.

### Gamma-ray Lasers (gasers)

Nothing has been announced officially about X-ray lasers, but certain work is going on with gamma-ray lasers under Navy auspices, though the work has not progressed very far as yet.
The Russians have also announced work in this field.


The approach is to use a gamma-ray-emitting isotope of ruthenium to raise a radioactive isotope of rhodium to a higher energy state that is metastable.
After a half-life of some 40&nbsp;days, the level of energy emitted by the ruthenium will drop to that of the metastable state of the rhodium isotope, and trigger emission at roughly 0.3&nbsp;&Aring;.

There are many problems in the way, however.
First, one has to find a way to make a crystal containing the appropriate isotopes without changing their essential characteristics.
Next comes the problem of containing the gamma rays (they will penetrate just about anything) so as to achieve spatial coherence.
If achieved, a gamma-ray laser would be a death ray in every sense of the word.
Gamma rays have several times the burning power of X rays, which are, of course, harmful when improperly applied.

### The Future of the Laser

As we have seen, the laser has the advantage of providing a monochromatic or single-color light source.
Furthermore, its beam is so collimated that all its energy can be focused on a very small spot.
It is also highly directive, with little or no tendency for the beam to bend or spread out even over the astronomical distances of outer space.
These properties have suggested a great many uses in national defense, industry, medicine, and science.

Lasers may be developed into devastating antipersonnel weapons for use on the battlefield.
They may be sent into space on special platforms to fight intercontinental ballistic missiles or to destroy hostile space stations or satellites.
The laser may also be used to modify chemical compounds or even to change the genetic characteristics of the protein molecules of living organisms.


Someday special fiber-optic light pipes or other optical wave guides, such as evacuated tubes with an internal mirror system, may carry laser signals much as coaxial cables now carry telephone conversations and network television programs between cities.
A fiber-optic light pipe is a very fine glass, plastic, or arsenic-trisulfide rod polished on the outside; its walls reflect light back inside so that it can bend around corners and still carry a light beam.

One way to put a TV signal on a laser beam is first to impress the complete TV picture and sound (the video signal) on a microwave carrier.
The microwave carrier is then used to excite a special crystal situated in a microwave cavity or special metal box.
When the laser beam traverses the crystal, entering and leaving the cavity through small side windows, the beam is modulated or made to vary in accordance with the modulated microwave signal.
At the receiver, the beam of a microwave traveling-wave amplifier phototube is similarly made to vary in accordance with the variations of the laser light striking the traveling wave tube&#39;s photocathode.
We now have again the microwave carrier with the video signal riding on it.
This signal is demodulated, using conventional electronic circuits to give the original TV picture and sound.


A wideband video channel can be divided into many subchannels, actually some 600, each of which can carry a telephone conversation.
Electronic circuits called filters slice up the video channel into so-called voice channels.
Each voice channel is about o to 2,000&nbsp;cycles per second wide.
Each incoming telephone signal is heterodyned, or moved up, in frequency to fit a specific voice channel at the transmitting end, then moved down in frequency and routed out on its proper telephone line at the receiving end.

A laser communications system would greatly expand the capabilities of our nationwide telecommunications network.
Tiny lasers may also function as parts of the memory system of a computer.
Such a computer would literally work with the speed of light.


Who knows?
You may even one day have a laser ignition system in your automobile!

### Military Uses

One of the first uses that occurs to most people is to build a big, superpower laser and use it to shoot down ballistic missile nose cones.
This would, they reason, make our nation secure from the terrors of thermonuclear war.

But it isn&#39;t as easy as all that.
Even the most powerful lasers can at present penetrate only $\frac{1}{8}$&nbsp;inch of high-carbon (easily burnable) steel.
And the holes they make are mere pinpricks.
Furthermore, burning requires that the laser be only a distance of a few feet from the steel.
At longer ranges, the water vapor and dust in the atmosphere severely reduce the effective power of the light ray.


Nevertheless, the Air Force is hard at work trying to develop big lasers and figuring out how to deploy them effectively outside the earth&#39;s atmosphere: atop mountain peaks, aboard orbiting satellites, or even on antimissile missiles.

Meanwhile, the military and space agencies have other, more prosaic, but none the less vital uses for the laser.
When the Apollo lunar capsule carries the first Americans to the vicinity of the moon, the two-man crew aboard the Lunar Excursion Module that will make the actual landing on the moon will probably use a laser altimeter to feel their way onto the lunar surface.
Before that, astronauts in Project Gemini will use laser radar to practice rendezvous and docking of satellites in space.
Already a large laser at Wallops Island, Virginia, has tracked an orbiting satellite 1,000&nbsp;miles up.
Incidentally, at that range the laser beam was only 200&nbsp;feet in diameter.

The Army has ordered several laser range finders for use on the battlefield.
They will be able to measure the distance to targets far more accurately than their optical or radar counterparts.

During World War II the Army made effective use of sniperscopes and snooperscopes, infrared devices that located targets even at night.
But for such devices to be effective, the target had to be a good deal warmer than the background.
Now, with an infrared laser, it would be possible to scan the target and get a picture regardless of its temperature.

During World War II the Navy used infrared &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; equipment (usually Nerst tubes or hot filaments enclosed by a black metal hood and placed behind a deep ruby lens) for short-range communications between ships.
But the laser affords a much more efficient and less easily detectable source of infrared.

The Armed Forces have a project under way to see just how fast a computer can operate.
Some people think that the result will be a new high-speed giant brain for our ballistic missile early-warning system.
But a better guess is that such a computer will be used to crack secret enemv codes and ciphers.
Anyway, one part of this project is a laser computer, sponsored by the Air Force, in which light pulses would do the counting instead of electrical signals.
Such a computer would be faster by several orders of magnitude than any computer now available, since light travels faster than electrical current, which is slowed down by the action of reactive elements, such as capacitors and inductors in the circuit.

### Industrial Applications

Industry is already using lasers to perform delicate machining and welding operations in the manufacture of microelectronic circuits.

A microelectronic circuit is fabricated on a thin wafer of silicon.
Sometimes forty circuits are made at one time on a wafer only an inch in diameter.
Each circuit can do the work of, say, a five-tube radio or perhaps a computer stage.

The circuits are made by allowing certain selected impurities to diffuse into the silicon wafer in prescribed patterns.
These patterns are formed by first allowing a film of silicon dioxide (glass) to grow over the silicon wafer&emdash;usually by applying steam to the surface&emdash;then selectively etching away portions of the film.

Selective removal of the oxide is accomplished by first coating the oxide with so-called photoresist&emdash;a film that becomes tough and acid-resistant when exposed to light&emdash;then masking the wafer with a diffusion mask and exposing the unprotected photoresist to light.
The wafer is next etched with strong acid, and its silicon-dioxide coat is eaten away except where it is protected by light-hardened photoresist.

Preparation of the diffusion mask is a critical operation, and laser machining of metallic foil is expected to allow making sharper and more precise pattern outlines.
Possibly lasers may be used to remove the oxide itself, thus saving several steps in the process of manufacturing micro- circuits.

Laser light sources could be valuable in high-speed photography where chromatic aberration or the unequal bending of light of different wavelengths through the camera lens can cause a blurred image.

Since different components of the atmosphere absorb different wavelengths of light to a greater or lesser extent, a bank of lasers used at an airport as a transmissometer could disclose not only the visibility at the end of the runway&emdash;as the optical devices already in use do&emdash;but also the makeup of the atmosphere at any particular time.
Such a laser device could also be useful in air-pollution studies.
(Transmissometers are used even though the end of the runway may indeed be visible from the control tower; the view from the tower is not what an approaching pilot sees; besides, the instrument, unlike a human observer, remains on duty around the clock.)

In a chemical process, a laser might be created so that its beam is absorbed to a great extent by the desired product.
The laser could be focused permanently through the output pipe, and automatic control equipment could be adjusted so that the product absorbs maximum light from the beam.
This would assure that the product in the output pipe has precisely the desired chemical composition.


The ability of a laser beam to carry an almost infinite amount of information has set communications engineers to speculating about its possible use for trunkline or intercity communications.
Today, these are handled by coaxial cables or microwave links. One microwave link can earn 1 four television programs simultaneously or replace any one of the television channels with up to 600 telephone conversations.
But a laser beam could carry many times this amount of information.


Nevertheless, since dust and water vapor in the atmosphere severely reduce the effective power of a laser beam, a serious problem still remains before lasers can be used for practical communications.
Of course, short-distance communications would indeed be possible, as would communications to and from communications satellites.
In the latter case, the beam travels in the earth&#39;s atmosphere for only a relatively short distance, although the total trip might be 1,000&nbsp;miles or even more.

One answer to abetting laser communications would be to use light pipes or evacuated tubes with mirrors arranged to conduct the beam around corners where necessary.

A laser telephone exchange has been contemplated.
Here the light pulses would be conducted by fiber optic strands.
These strands carry light around comers just as copper wires carry electrical current.
Though a fiber-optic strand severely cuts down the power of the light being transmitted, in a telephone exchange the length of the interconnecting strands can be kept short by design.
The big advantage of a laser telephone exchange would be that there would be no crossed wires or unwanted pickup between adjacent optical fibers so that you would not occasionally hear fragments of another conversation on your line.

### Medical Uses

Lasers have been regarded as a major boon to medicine.
Thousands of Americans suffer each year from a detached retina.
In this condition the retina, the light or sensitive area at the rear of the eye, comes loose from the inner surface or choroid coating of the eyeball.
The fluid, or humor, with which the eye is filled works in behind the retina and aggravates the condition.
Initially, the condition causes distorted vision, but if the retina becomes completely loose from the optic nerve, blindness results.
A laser beam can be focused through the lens of the eye so that it makes small scars around the periphery of the retina and thus welds it back into place.

A laser can also burn out small tumors in the eye.
In fact, a laser beam can be made as narrow in diameter as the diameter of a single human cell.
Some surgeons see the laser, therefore, as a device that can burn out tumors with minimum risk of damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
Lasers have also been considered for suturing wounds through heat.
The laser would cauterize the wound as it sutured it.
It could also be used to disinfect small areas quickly.
Dentists have experimented recently with laser drills; they are fast, sure, and painless.


It is conceivable that laser beams can be made even narrower in diameter than a single protein molecule.
Such a laser beam might be used to alter the genetic properties of living organisms.


A team of medical scientists has reported that irradiation by a laser beam has altered the electrical conductivity of whole human blood.
Just what this means or how it occurs has not yet been made apparent.

### Scientific Applications

Perhaps some of the most far-reaching effects of the laser will be in the fields of pure and applied science.
The laser may profoundly affect man&#39;s understanding of his natural environment.

Our most basic quantities of measurement are length, mass, and time.
Two of these, length and time, are related by a constant, the velocity of light in a vacuum, and yet the value of this constant is only imperfectly known.

Our national standard of frequency is calibrated from the same astronomical observations that give us our measure of time, since the frequency of cycles per second that a wave executes is intimately related to time.


When dealing with radiation in the visible region, scientists measure wavelength instead of frequency.
But if the standard radio frequencies could be doubled, redoubled, and then redoubled again as many times as necessary to reach the visible-light region, then length and time would be one and the same thing irrespective of our uncertainty as to the exact speed of light in a vacuum.

Another basic scientific problem is the question of whether ether exists or not.
You recall that we explained electromagnetic waves by comparing them to waves in a pond.
Many scientists have found it equally hard to conceive of waves without postulating some substance or medium in which the waves could move or propagate.

Accordingly, they postulated ether&emdash;a colorless, odorless substance filling all space&emdash;in which electromagnetic waves could propagate just as waves propagate in a pond.
For years now, scientists have been trying to relegate ether to the same never-never land as phlogiston and other weird substances once postulated by alchemists to explain physical phenomena they could not understand.

The first experiment to disprove the existence of ether was the Michaelson-Morley experiment: If the earth is rotating in a stationary sea of ether, the ether will drift by the earth in a direction counter to the earth&#39;s rotation.
Now, suppose two light beams are transmitted at right angles to each other in such a way that the ether drift will add to the speed of one beam while the other beam will travel perpendicular to the ether drift and therefore be unaffected by it.
Then any difference in velocity caused by ether drift could be detected by measuring the difference in frequency of the two beams.
To make the measurement more precise, the apparatus emitting the light beam is next turned around so that the ether drift will oppose the speed of the beam instead of adding to it; the frequency difference (if any) can again be measured.
If the sum of the two frequency differences were significant, an ether drift could be said to exist.
This experiment has been carried out with the use of gas lasers, but no significant frequency difference has been noticed that could substantiate the existence of an ether.

In the realm of applied science, the laser shows greatest promise in spectroscopy.
We have referred at many times to absorption of infrared, light, and ultraviolet frequencies by certain substances.
The exact frequencies absorbed depend upon the chemical composition of the substance and the structure of its molecules.
The totality of frequencies absorbed or the absorption spectrum of a substance is as individual as your fingerprints.
Therefore spectroscopy is a basic tool for physicists and chemists studying the properties of matter.
But better discrimination in spectroscopy is needed, and to get it, scientists must know the exact frequencies with which a substance is irradiated.
As the number of laser materials increases, and consequently the number of available coherent light frequencies increases, spectroscopists can look forward to more efficient tools that will enable them to gain greater and greater insight into the basic makeup of matter.

### Conclusion

In this chapter we have explained the continuum of the electromagnetic spectrum in terms of both frequency and wavelength.
We have come to grips with some of the basic concepts of quantum mechanics and have seen how they explain the action of the three basic types of lasers: optically pumped, gaseous electrically pumped, and injection.
We have discussed the phenomenon of fluorescence and have seen how laser action is related to fluorescence but differs from it because of (a) its frequency coherence or monochromaticity and (b) its spatial coherence, or the fact that all wavelets keep in step.


(Incidentally, this last gem of knowledge now makes you smarter than a certain covey of investors with more spare cash than technical knowledge.
They lost several kilobucks supporting a glib physicist with a lab full of bottles of fluorescent material that he passed off as lasers completely covering the visible spectrum!
Of course, they weren&#39;t lasers at all.)

Finally, we have looked at the whole electromagnetic spectrum in terms of how coherent radiation is or might be produced by quantum devices, and have placed a special emphasis on a possible gamma-ray laser.
And we have seen the impact of lasers on national defense, industry, medicine, and science.

Now we shall look backward and see how the laser actually came into being.
