If there is a logical order in which the various applications of polarizers and polarized light should be considered, the authors have never discovered it.
The policy adopted here is to consider the most popular and &ldquo;humanistic&rdquo; applications first, and the more scientific and esoteric applications last.

<span class="textsc">Polarization And The Human Eye</span>

The most humanistic fact about polarization of light is that it can be detected directly by the naked eye.
Nearly anyone, if told carefully what to look for, can succeed in this.
Sometimes he can even determine the form and azimuth of polarization.


What the observer actually &ldquo;sees&rdquo; is a certain faint pattern known as Haidinger&#39;s brush and illustrated in Fig \ref{fig:10-1}.
The brush is so faint and ill-defined that it will escape notice unless the field of view is highly uniform: a clear blue sky makes an ideal background, and a brightly illuminated sheet of white paper is nearly as good.
The best procedure for a beginner is to hold a linear polarizer in front of his eye, stare fixedly through it toward a clear blue sky, and, after five or ten seconds, suddenly turn the polarizer through 90&deg;.
Immediately the brush is seen.
It fades away in two or three seconds, but reappears if the polarizer is again turned through 90&deg;.
The brush itself is symmetric, double-ended, and yellow in color; it is small, subtending an angle of only about 2&deg; or 3&deg;.
The adjacent areas appear blue, perhaps merely by contrast. The long axis of the brush is approximately perpendicular to the direction of electric vibration in the linearly polarized beam, i.e., perpendicular to the transmission axis of the polarizer used.

\label{fig:10-1}
\caption{Approximate appearance of Haidinger&#39;s brush when the vibration direction of the beam is vertical.}
</figure>


Circular polarization, too, can be detected directly by eye, and even the handedness can be determined.
When an observer facing a clear blue sky places a right circular polarizer in front of his eye, he sees the yellow brush and finds that its long axis has an upward-to-the-right, downward-to-the-left direction, i.e., an azimuth of about +45&deg;.
This is true, of course, irrespective of the orientation of the polarizer, since a circle has no top or bottom.
If he employs a left circular polarizer, he finds the brush to have a &minus;45&deg; orientation.
In each case the pattern fades away rapidly, but can be restored to full vigor by switching to a polarizer of opposite handedness.
Instead of using a circular polarizer the observer can use a single linear polarizer in series with a 90&deg; retarder, the latter being held nearer to the eye.
Turning the retarder through 90&deg; reverses the handedness of the circular polarization.

Some people see the brush easily; others have difficulty.
A few see the brush when looking innocently at the partially polarized blue sky, i.e., without using any polarizer at all, and even without meaning to see the brush.
Some people see the brush more distinctly by linearly polarized light than by circularly polarized light, and for others the reverse is true.
An observer may find the brush to have a slightly different orientation depending on which eye is used.


The spectral energy distribution of the light is important.
If the light is rich in short-wavelength (blue) radiation, the brush is very noticeable, but if the short-wavelength radiation is eliminated by means of a yellow filter, the brush fails to appear.
Use of a blue filter tends to accentuate the brush.


Although the phenomenon was discovered in 1844, by the Austrian mineralogist Haidinger, the cause is not yet fully understood.
Presumably the thousands of tiny blue-light-absorbing bodies in the central (foveal) portion of the retina are dichroic and are oriented in a radial pattern, for example, a pattern such that the absorption axis of each body lies approximately along a radius from the center of the fovea.
Incident linearly polarized light will then be absorbed more strongly in some parts of the pattern than in other parts and consequently some parts will fatigue more than others.
When the vibration direction of the light is suddenly changed, the varying degrees of fatigue are revealed as a subjective radial pattern.
Presumably no such dichroism or orientation pattern applies to longer wavelength (yellow and red) light; consequently a yellow sensation dominates in those regions where fatigue-to-blue has occurred.

The fact that circular polarization, also, may be detected perhaps implies that some transparent portion of the eye is weakly birefringent and acts like a retarder, converting circularly polarized light to linearly or elliptically polarized light.
The direction of the major axis of the ellipse depends only on the direction of the fast axis of the retarding layer and hence remains fixed&emdash;unless the observer tips his head.

Perhaps physicists will some day write matrices to describe the retarding layers and dichroic areas of the eye.
Poets were the first to see magic fire and jewels in the human eye; physicists will be the first to see matricesl


Bees, too, can detect the vibration direction of linearly polarized light.
The experiments of the biologist K. von Frisch during World War II showed that bees &ldquo;navigate&rdquo; back and forth between hive and source of honey by using the sun as a guide.
More interesting, when the sun is obscured by a large area of clouds the bees can still navigate successfully if they can see a bit of blue sky: they can detect the azimuth of linear polarization of the blue light and navigate with respect to it.
One way of demonstrating the bee&#39;s ability to detect the azimuth of polarization is to place the bee in a large box the top of which consists of a huge sheet of linear polarizer, such as H-sheet.
Each time the experimenter turns the polarizer to a different azimuth, the bee changes his direction of attempted travel correspondingly.


Certain other animals also can detect the polarization of skylight and navigate by it.
This includes ants, beetles, and the fruit fly Drosophila. Probably many other examples will be discovered.

<span class="textsc">Polarization of Sky Light</span>

Blue-sky light traveling in a direction roughly at right angles to the sun&#39;s rays is partially polarized.
When an observer holds a linear polarizer in front of his eye and gazes in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the sun, he finds that rotating the polarizer slowly causes the sky to change from bright to dark successively.
The degree of polarization of sky light may reach 70 or 80 percent when the air is clear and dust-free, the sun is moderately low in the sky, and the observation direction is near the zenith.


The polarization is a result of the scattering of the sun&#39;s rays by the molecules in the air.
Rayleigh&#39;s well-known inverse-fourth-power law relating scattering intensity to wavelength accounts for the blue color of the scattered light, and the asymmetry associated with the 90&deg; viewing angle accounts for the polarization, as explained in Chapter 5.
Some multiple scattering occurs, and this reduces the degree of polarization somewhat; when the observer ascends to a higher altitude, the amount of air involved is reduced, multiple scattering is reduced, and the degree of polarization is increased.
A further increase results when a yellow or red filter is used to block the short-wavelength component of the light and transmit the long-wavelength component&emdash;the latter component is less subject to multiple scattering.
(The situation is very different for infrared radiation of wavelength exceeding 2 microns: much of this radiation is produced by emission from the air itself, rather than by scattering, and this exhibits little or no polarization.)


Some persons are capable of detecting the polarization of sky light directly by eye, by virtue of the Haidinger brush phenomenon discussed in a preceding section; a few individuals find the brush noticeable enough to be a nuisance.
Ordinarily, of course, it escapes notice and plays little part in the affairs of man.
Its practical use by bees, ants, etc., has been indicated, and the importance to photographers is discussed in a later section.

<span class="textsc">Polarization Of Light Under Water</span>

A surprising fact about the polarization found in light present beneath the surface of the ocean (or of a pond) is that the predominant direction of electric vibration is horizontal.
The opposite might be expected, since most of the light that enters the water enters obliquely from above, and the most strongly reflected component of obliquely incident light is the horizontally vibrating component.
But oceanographers and biologists, working at depths of 5 to 30 feet in waters off Bermuda and in the Mediterranean Sea, have found the main cause of submarine polarization to be the scattering of the light by microscopic particles suspended in the water.
Sunlight and sky light enter the water from above, and the average direction of illumination is roughly vertical; consequently the polarization form of the scattered light that travels horizontally toward an underwater observer is partially polarized with the electric vibration direction horizontal.
The situation is much the same as that discussed in Chapter 5, except that the incident light has a more steeply downward direction and the asymmetric scattering is by microscopic particles instead of molecules.

Typically, the degree of polarization is 5 to 30 percent, an amount found to be important to a variety of underwater life.
The water flea Daphnia tends to swim in a direction perpendicular to the electric vibration direction, for reasons not yet known.
When tests are conducted in a tank filled with water that is free of suspended particles, so that the submarine illumination is practically unpolarized, Daphnia ceases to favor any one direction.
But if suspended matter is added, thus restoring the polarization, Daphnia resumes the custom of traveling perpendicular to the vibration direction.


The arthropod Limulus (horse shoe crab) easily detects the polarization of the underwater light and is presumed to navigate with respect to the electric vibration direction.
The same is true of the crustacean Mysidium gracile and various other forms of marine life. Most tend to swim perpendicularly to the vibration direction; some swim parallel to it; a few swim at different relative orientations depending on the time of day.
For all of these animals, polarization is a compass that works even under water!

<span class="textsc">Polarizing Sunglasses</span>

The lenses of ordinary sunglasses employ absorbing materials that are isotropic, and accordingly the incident light is attenuated by a fixed factor irrespective of polarization form.
This is unfortunate.
The fact is that &ldquo;glare&rdquo; consists predominantly of light having a horizontal vibration direction.
Why?
For these reasons:

(a) The main source of light (sun and sky) is overhead, and consequently the main flux of light is downward.

(b) The surfaces that are most strongly illuminated by the downward flux are horizontal surfaces.

(c) Such surfaces are usually viewed obliquely, since a person seldom looks straight down.

(d) Most outdoor objects are of dielectric material.

(e) Light reflected obliquely from a horizontal dielectric surface is partially linearly polarized with the dominant vibration direction horizontal, as explained in Chapter 4.

Polarizing sunglasses take full advantage of this fact.
The lenses are made of dichroic material (H-sheet, usually) oriented with the transmission axis vertical, as indicated in Fig. \ref{10-2a}, so that almost all of the horizontal vibrations are absorbed.
The component having vertical vibration direction is transmitted.
Usually some isotropic absorber is included in the lenses to absorb ultraviolet light strongly and blue and red light to a moderate extent; the sunglasses then have a greenish hue which has nothing to do with the polarization.

<figure>
\label{fig:10-2}
\caption{

    In (b) the axis is horizontal, for eliminating reflections from vertical windows of trains, store-fronts (show-windows), etc.
    In (c) the axis directions are 45&deg; and &minus;45&deg;, a standard arrangement used in viewing polarization-coded stereoscopic pictures.
}
</figure>


Motorists and vacationists find that polarizing sunglasses are helpful not only in reducing the brightness of the field of view as a whole, but also in enhancing the beauty of the scene.
Because specularly reflected light is absorbed preferentially, roads, trees, grassy fields, etc., appear softer and more deeply colored through polarizers.
Specularly reflected light tends to veil nature&#39;s inherent beauty; polarizing sunglasses remove the veil.


Fishermen and boatsmen enjoy another benefit from wearing polarizing sunglasses.
They want to be able to see fish, rocks, etc., beneath the surface of the water, yet the light from such objects is dim and is usually lost in the &ldquo;noise&rdquo; of the sky light reflected obliquely from the surface.
Since the reflected light is highly polarized with horizontal vibration direction, the polarizing sunglasses absorb this component strongly, and the visibility of the underwater objects is greatly increased.
The increase is greatest when the viewing direction corresponds to the polarizing angle, which, for water, is about 53&deg; from the normal.
When the viewing direction is along the normal, i.e., straight down, there is no increase at all.


There is one interesting situation in which polarizing sunglasses produce little increase in visibility of underwater objects even when the angle of viewing is the polarizing angle.
This situation occurs when the sky is clear and blue, the sun is low in the sky, and the pertinent portion of the sky is at 90&deg; from the direction of the sun.
Under these circumstances the light striking the water is already linearly polarized at such an azimuth that almost none of it is reflected.
There is no task left for the sunglasses to perform&emdash;there is no reflected glare to suppress.
The underwater objects are seen with great clarity.
Persons unfamiliar with the polarization of sky light and with the dependence of oblique reflection on polarization form are likely to ascribe the remarkable clarity to &ldquo;especially clear water&rdquo; rather than to absence of reflection.


<span class="textsc">Camera Filters</span>

Photographers often wish to enhance the contrast between blue sky and white clouds.
Thirty years ago they did this by employing a yellow filter, which absorbed most of the blue light from the clear sky but transmitted most of the white light from the clouds.
Using ordinary black-and-white film, they obtained excellent contrast by this method.
Today, photographers are using color film increasingly, and the use of yellow filters is no longer permissible since it would eliminate all blue colors from the finished photograph.


The only known solution is to exploit the difference in polarization between blue sky and white clouds.
Light from most portions of the blue sky is partially linearly polarized, as explained in a preceding section, and light from clouds is unpolarized.
Therefore a neutral-color, linear polarizer mounted at the optimum azimuth in front of the lens will absorb a large fraction (e.g., 80 percent) of the sky light while transmitting a large fraction (nearly half) of the light from the clouds; thus the contrast is increased by a factor of two or three.
The factor is less if the air is hazy, and more if the air is extremely clear (as in Arizona) and if the camera is aimed about 90° from the direction of the sun.


The usual way of choosing the azimuth of the polarizer is crude, but perhaps adequate.
The photographer holds the polarizer in front of his eye, finds by trial and error which azimuth maximizes the contrast of the clouds in question, and then attempts to mount the polarizer on the camera without changing the azimuth of the polarizer.
One type of polarizing filter for cameras is equipped with a small &ldquo;satellite&rdquo; polarizer mounted at the end of a short arm and aligned permanently with the main polarizer.
The photographer installs the main polarizer in front of the lens, looks through the small polarizer and turns the arm to whatever azimuth maximizes the contrast.
Both polarizers then have this optimum orientation.
The satisfactoriness of the azimuth can be checked visually at any time.
Instead of using these empirical methods, a scientifically minded photographer can proceed by dead reckoning, i.e., by following this well-known rule: Mount the polarizer so that its transmission axis lies in the plane determined by camera, sun, and object photographed.
(So oriented, the polarizer performs a valuable additional service: it eliminates most of the specularly reflected light from trees, roads, etc., and enhances the softness and depth of color of the scene.)

When a photographer standing on a sidewalk tries to photograph objects situated behind a store window, the reflection of the street scene from the window may threaten to spoil the photograph.
An excellent solution is to place the camera off to one side so that the window is seen obliquely at about the polarizing angle, and mount a linear polarizer in front of the lens; the polarizer is turned so that its transmission axis is horizontal, and the polarized light reflected from the window is absorbed.
The authors have a friend who has applied this same principle to a pair of special spectacles he wears while touring the country by railroad.
The lenses consist of polarizers oriented with the transmission axis horizontal, as indicated in Fig. \ref{fig:10-2b}; thus when he gazes out of the train window in oblique forward direction, the reflected images of passengers and newspapers are wiped out, and the scenery appears in its pristine glory.


<span class="textsc">Use of circular polarizers in eliminating Perpendicularly reflected light</span>

Eliminating perpendicularly reflected lights is a different problem from that of eliminating obliquely reflected light.
The process of oblique reflection at Brewster&#39;s angle causes the reflected beam to be linearly polarized, and accordingly a linear polarizer can eliminate the reflected beam entirely.
But the process of normal reflection, i.e., with incident and reflected beams perpendicular to the smooth glossy surface in question, produces no polarization at all.
How, then, can the specularly reflected light be eliminated while light originating behind the surface is transmitted freely?


The question is an important one to radar operators scanning the cathode-ray-oscilloscope screens on which dim greenish spots representing airborne objects appear.
The screen proper is situated in a large evacuated tube, and the greenish light emerges through a curved glass window at the front end of the tube.
(Sometimes the window is flat; sometimes a safety plate of glass or plastic is mounted close in front of it.)
Often the operator has difficulty in seeing the greenish spots, not only because they are faint, but also because they may be masked by various extraneous images reflected by the front surface of the window, e.g., reflections of room lights and of people, clothing, papers, etc., situated near the operator.
Extinguishing the room lights would eliminate these reflections, but would make it impossible for the operator to read instructions or make notes.
What he needs is some kind of filter that will transmit the light originating behind the window and absorb the light reflected approximately perpendicularly from it.

This need is filled by the circular polarizer.
Such a device, if mounted close in front of the window, will transmit nearly half of the light that originates behind the window, yet will eliminate about 99 percent of the room light that is reflected perpendicularly from it.
The circular polarizer acts on the room light twice: it circularly polarizes room light that is approaching the window, then absorbs the reflected component.
The logic behind this requires explanation.
Two key facts must be kept in mind:

(1) A beam that is reflected perpendicularly and specularly by a smooth glossy surface has the same degree of polarization as the incident beam, since the reflection process does not introduce randomness of any kind.

(2) The reflection process reverses the handedness of polarization, because handedness is defined with respect to the propagation direction and the reflection process reverses the propagation direction.

<figure>
\label{fig:10-3}
\caption{
    Use of a circular polarizer in absorbing light reflected by a surface approximately perpendicular to the incident beam.
    Note that the reflection process reverses the handedness of circular polarization.
}
</figure>



If the polarizer is of right-circular type, as in the arrangement shown in Fig. \ref{fig:10-3}, room light that passes through and approaches the window is right-circularly polarized; the reflected light is /e/f-circularly polarized and hence is totally absorbed by the polarizer.
In effect, the circular polarizer &ldquo;codes&rdquo; the light, the window reverses the coding, and the polarizer then annihilates the reverse-coded beam.
If both faces of the window are ideally flat and smooth, if the light is incident exactly along the normal, and if the polarizer is truly of circular type, the reflected light is totally absorbed.
Usually the conditions are less ideal: the rear surface of the window usually serves as support for the luminescent screen and has a matte appearance; the window is usually curved and much of the troublesome room light incident on the window makes an angle of 10&deg; or 20&deg; or more with the normal; and the polarizer, although circular with respect to some wavelengths, is elliptical with respect to others.
Nevertheless, the improvement provided by the polarizer is large, and the amount of faint detail that the operator can see on the screen is greatly increased.


One precaution must be mentioned: reflections from the polarizer itself must be avoided.
This is usually accomplished by tilting the polarizer forward so that the only reflected images the observer sees are images of a dark-colored floor or other dark objects.


Television sets, also, have been equipped successfully with circular polarizers.
If the set is used in a brightly lit room, or is used outdoors, the circular polarizer performs a valuable service in trapping the specularly reflected glare and thus increasing the picture-vs-glare ratio by a factor of the order of 10.

<span class="textsc">Variable-density filter</span>

A pair of linear polarizers arranged in series is an almost ideal device for controlling the transmitted intensity of light.
Rotating one polarizer through an angle &theta; with respect to the other causes the intensity of the transmitted light to vary approximately as cos<sup>2</sup>&theta;.
Because the transmittance is easily varied and easily calculated, the pair of polarizers has found much favor in the eyes of designers of spectrophotometers and other devices for controlling and measuring light intensity.


Specially designed sunglasses employing pairs of linear polarizers in place of lenses have been used successfully by aviators and others.
One polarizer of each pair can be rotated through an angle as large as 90&deg;, and a linkage connecting the two pairs insures that the attenuation is the same for both eyes.
By moving one small lever, the wearer can vary the transmittance throughout a range of about 10,000 to 1.

Controllable pairs of very-large-diameter polarizers have been used as windows of railroad cars and ocean liners.
A person sitting near such a window turns a small knob to rotate one polarizer with respect to the other and thus reduce the intensity of the transmitted light to any extent desired.


One of the authors has experimented with a variable-density filter employing three linear polarizers in series, in order that a transmittance range of 10<sup>8</sup> to 1 could be achieved.
The device worked well and, as expected, obeyed a cosine-fourth, rather than a cosine-square law.

<span class="textsc">Three-dimensional photography and the use of polarizers for coding</span>

Millions of polarizers found their way into the motion picture theaters of North America in 1952 and 1953 when stereoscopic (three-dimensional, or 3-D) movies achieved brief prominence.
Each spectator wore a pair of polarizing spectacles called viewers, and polarizers were mounted in front of the projectors.


A photographer who enjoys looking at 3-D still pictures in his living room needs no polarizers.
Usually he employs a small viewing box containing a light source and two lenses, one for each eye; a black partition, or septum, divides the box into right and left halves.
The picture, consisting of two small transparencies mounted about two inches apart in a side-by-side arrangement on a cardboard frame, is inserted in the box so that the right-eye transparency lines up with the right lens and the left-eye transparency lines up with the left lens.
(The two transparencies are, of course, slightly different because they were taken by cameras situated about two or three inches apart; the spacing used approximates the spacing of the two eyes.)
The side-by-side arrangement of the two transparencies and the presence of the septum insure that the observer&#39;s right eye sees only the right transparency and the left eye sees only the left transparency.
No cross-communication, or &ldquo;cross-talk,&rdquo; can occur.
Consequently the observer enjoys an impressively realistic stereoscopic illusion.


When 3-D motion-picture films are projected in a theater, many complications arise.
Separate projectors must be provided for the right-eye and left-eye movie films, and the two projectors must be synchronized within about 0.01 second.
Since there is just one large screen and this is to be viewed by hundreds of spectators, there can be no septum.
Indeed, no practical geometrical method of preventing cross-talk is known.


Before the advent of mass-produced polarizers in the 1930&#39;s, an analglyph system of preventing cross-talk was invented.
It applied wavelength coding to the two projected beams.
The right-eye picture was projected through a long-wavelength (red) filter, and the left-eye picture was projected through a shorter-wavelength (green) filter.
The spectator&#39;s viewers contained right and left lenses of red and green plastic, respectively, and accordingly each lens transmitted light from the appropriate projector and absorbed light from the other.
Thus each eye received just the light intended for it.
The system succeeded as a short-term novelty: stereoscopic illusions were created.
But the system had two major defects: chromatic &ldquo;retinal rivalry&rdquo; between the two eyes, and incompatibility with the showing of colored motion pictures.


In the 1930&#39;s the problem was solved with £clat by a polarization-coding system, demonstrated with great impact at the New York World&#39;s Fair of 1939 and improved in later years.
As indicated in Fig. \ref{fig:10-4}, a linear polarizer oriented with its transmission axis at &minus;45&deg; is placed in front of the projector used for the right-eye pictures, and a polarizer at +45&minus; is placed in front of the projector used for the left-eye pictures.
Thus the two beams striking the movie screen are orthogonally coded.
The lenses of the spectator&#39;s viewers consist of correspondingly oriented linear polarizers, and so each eye receives only light that originates in the appropriate projector.
Superb stereoscopic illusions result.
Since the polarizers perform well at all wavelengths in the visual range, color movies can be presented as easily and faithfully as can black-and-white movies.


The polarizers placed in front of the projectors consist, ordinarily, of K-sheet; as explained in Chapter 3, K-sheet is highly resistant to heat, and any polarizing filter placed close in front of a powerful projector is bound to heat up considerably since it necessarily absorbs about half the light.
The lenses of the 3-D viewers are usually of HN-38 sheet; it has high major transmittance <span class="math">k_1</span> and small minor transmittance <span class="math">k_2</span>, and it is inexpensive.
The viewers are cheap enough (about 10\textcent each) that they can be discarded after a single use.

<figure>
\label{fig:10-4}

    The viewer contains correspondingly oriented polarizers, and accordingly each eye sees only the images intended for it.
}
</figure>

The polarization-coding scheme has one limitation: if the spectator tilts his head to one side, the polarizers in his viewers no longer line up accurately with the respective polarizers on the projectors.
Thus cross-talk occurs: the right eye sees faintly the image meant for the left eye, and vice versa: each eye sees a faint ghost image in addition to the main image.
The spectator does not enjoy this.
The difficulty could be avoided if the linear polarizers were replaced by high-quality, achromatic circular polarizers, but unfortunately no method is known for producing achromatic circular polarizers economically.


The effectiveness of any polarization-coding projection system is destroyed if the screen depolarizes the light appreciably.
Screens that have a smooth aluminum coating usually conserve polarization to the extent of about 99 percent, but those having a matte white surface or a rough metallic coating produce much depolarization and hence much cross-talk between the two images.
Many of the screens used in the innocent days of 1952 and 1953 were of the wrong type, and the resulting ghost images were a major annoyance.
For that reason, and because of frequent lack of care in maintaining synchronism between the two projectors, movie-goers socn turned back to conventional 2-D pictures.
Some nostalgia remains, however.
Persons who were lucky enough to see a full-color, 3-D movie showing attractive actors filmed against a background of gorgeous scenery look forward to the time when well-made, well-presented 3-D movies, with their almost miraculous realism and intimacy, will animate the theaters once again.

<span class="textsc">The Vectograph</span>

The type of three-dimensional photography discussed in the preceding section is parallel-projected 3-D photography.
The two motion-picture films are situated side-by-side, and two projectors are operated in parallel.
During the late 1930&#39;s a radically new approach, called vcctography, was developed by E. H. Land, J. Mahler, and others. In this system, the two films are arranged in series, bonded together.
Because of the permanent series arrangement, many problems disappear.
Only one projector is needed, and perfect synchronism is &ldquo;guaranteed at the factory.&rdquo;
Each pair of pictures (each vectograph) is projected as a single unit, in the same projector aperture and at the same time, and onto the same area of the same screen.
If the film breaks, it can be spliced with no concern as to preservation of synchronism.


The method can succeed only if means are provided for preserving the identity of the two coincident projected beams.
Again, polarization-coding is the answer.
However, because the two images are bonded together in series, the coding must occur within the images themselves.
In the system used by Land and Mahler each image consists of varying quantities of linearly dichroic molecules aligned in a common direction, and the directions employed in the two images are mutually at right angles.
Dark areas in any one image contain a high concentration of dichroic molecules; light areas contain little or no dichroic material; but irrespective of concentration, the alignment direction is always the same.
For the other image, the alignment direction is always orthogonal to the first.
It is to be noted that the images contain no silver and no other isotropic absorber.
Only aligned absorbers having high dichroic ratio are used.


A communications engineer would describe the vectograph by saying that it provides two distinct channels.
Each is assigned to one image. Each is independent of the other.
Since the vectograph images themselves perform the polarization coding, no polarizer is used in front of the projector; indeed, the interposition of such a filter would play havoc with the system.
As before, the screen must preserve the polarization and the spectator&#39;s viewers must perform the appropriate decoding, or discriminating, act.
Excellent stereoscopic effects are achieved.
However, the production of vectograph film is a costly undertaking involving very specialized equipment, and constant attention is needed to maintain high enough dichroic ratio so that the channels are truly independent and ghost images are avoided.

Vectograph pictures of the &ldquo;still&rdquo; type are easier and cheaper to make than vectograph movies. Stereo pairs of aerial photographs of mountainous country, if presented in vectograph form, give a navigator (wearing an appropriate viewer) a very realistic impression of the terrain, and a map maker can prepare an accurate contour map from the vectograph with ease.

<span class="textsc">Polarizing headlights</span>

It is ironic that the main goal of Land and others in developing high-quality, large-area, low-cost polarizers has never been achieved.
The polarizers are used with great success in dozens of applications, but not the application that was uppermost in the minds of the inventors.


Their goal was to eliminate glare from automobile headlights.
In an era when dual-lane highways, circumferential bypasses, and other safety engineering advances were virtually unknown and the aim and focus of automobile headlights were highly erratic, the glare that confronted motorists at night was almost unbearable, and was an important cause of accidents.
As early as 1920 several illumination engineers recognized that the glare could be eliminated by means of polarizers&emdash;if large-area polarizers could somehow be produced.
If every headlight lens were covered by a linear polarizer oriented with the transmission axis horizontal and every windshield were covered with a linear polarizer oriented with its axis vertical, no direct light from the headlights of Car <span class="math">A</span> could pass through the windshield of oncoming Car <span class="math">B</span>.
Drivers in both cars could see road-markings, pedestrians, and so forth, but neither would experience any glare from the other&#39;s headlights.
Moreover, it would be permissible for each driver to use his <em>high</em> beam continuously, and accordingly his ability to see pedestrians, etc., would be greater than before, despite the fact that each polarizer would transmit only about half of the light incident on it.


It was soon recognized that the analyzing polarizer should not be made a permanent part of the windshield, but should be incorporated in a small visor situated just in front of the driver&#39;s eyes.
During the day, when headlights were not in use, the visor could be swung out of the way.
It was also recognized that care should be taken to make sure the headlight polarizers had sufficient light-leak, i.e., sufficiently large <span class="math">k_2</span> value, that the headlights of oncoming cars would not disappear entirely!

Land and his colleagues moved rapidly.
They invented a whole series of polarizers, each superior to its predecessor.
The first successful type, J-sheet, employed aligned, microscopic crystals of the dichroic mineral herapathite; the method of manufacture is described in Chapter 3.
Then came H-sheet, which was better in nearly every respect and in addition was easier to make.
Finally, K-sheet appeared; it had most of the superb qualities of the earlier materials and the added virtue of being unaffected by fairly high temperature, such as 215 &deg;F.
To persons seeking polarizers for use in headlights, K-sheet appeared to be the pot of gold at the end of a polarized rainbow.


Concurrently, several better ways of orienting the polarizers were proposed.
One attractive scheme was to orient the headlight polarizers and the visor polarizer at the identical azimuth, namely &minus;45&deg;, as indicated in Fig. \ref{fig:10-5}.
Then, even a polarization-conserving object in the path of the headlights would appear to the driver to be brightly illuminated.
(This would not be the case if his visor polarizer were crossed with his headlight polarizers.)
The &minus;45&deg; system disposed of the headlight glare problem adequately: if two cars <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> both equipped in this manner approached one another at night, each driver&#39;s visor would be crossed with the other car&#39;s headlight polarizers, and neither driver would experience any glare.

Using the Mueller calculus, Billings and Land compared a wide variety of polarizer orientation schemes, and found several to be particularly attractive.
Perhaps the best system was one called &ldquo;&minus;55&deg;, &minus;35&deg;.&rdquo;
The transmission axes of the headlight polarizers and visor polarizer are at 55&deg; and 35&deg; from the vertical, respectively, an arrangement that minimizes complications stemming from the obliquity of the portion of the windshield situated just in front of the driver.

Despite the successes on all technical fronts, the project bogged down.
To this day no one knows just why.
Probably many little reasons were responsible.
Among these were the following:

(1) The polarizers absorbed slightly more than half of the light incident on them, and accordingly the automobile manufacturers felt that they would have to increase the power of the lamps themselves and perhaps use larger generators and batteries also.

(2) Some windshields were moderately birefringent; therefore they would act like retarders, alter the polarization form of the incident light, and allow some glare to leak through.

(3) Nearly every year the automobile manufacturers increased the backward tilt of the windshields; such tilt tends to alter the polarization form of light having an oblique vibration direction, and hence leads to glare-leak.

(4) Passengers, as well as drivers, would require visors, since passengers also dislike glare.

(5) Pedestrians might find that the glare was worse than ever, unless they too employed polarizing visors or spectacles.

(6) The system would succeed only if adopted by all car manufacturers, and therefore no one manufacturer would gain any promotional advantage from it.

(7) The first few drivers to put the system to use would get little benefit from it for at least a year or two, i.e., until millions of other cars were similarly equipped.

(8) It was difficult to decide when and how to force the owners of old cars to install the necessary polarizers on their cars.

(9) The patents on the only fully satisfactory polarizers were held by a single company.

(10) To introduce the system would require formal, coordinated action by all States.

(11) Improvements in headlight design and aiming, the increasing numbers of dual-lane highways, and the brighter street lamps used in cities and suburbs led some people to believe that the need for a polarization-type of glare control was no longer acute.

However, persons who have actually experienced the polarization method of glare removal are convinced that the drawbacks are trivial compared to the benefits.

Perhaps some day the system will be tried out on a pilot scale in a small, isolated community, where all the cars could be equipped with polarizers in a few weeks.
Perhaps an island of moderate size would make a good test ground.
If the system is found to be highly successful there, it will presumably spread throughout every country that teems with automobiles.
