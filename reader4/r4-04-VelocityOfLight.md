The velocity of light is one of the most important of the fundamental constants of Nature.
Its measurement by Foucault and Fizeau gave as the result a speed greater in air than in water, thus deciding in favor of the undulatory and against the corpuscular theory.
Again, the comparison of the electrostatic and the electromagnetic units gives as an experimental result a value remarkably close to the velocity of light&emdash;a result which justified Maxwell in concluding that light is the propagation of an electromagnetic disturbance.
Finally, the principle of relativity gives the velocity of light a still greater importance, since one of its fundamental postulates is the constancy of this velocity under all possible conditions.


The first attempt at measurement was due to Galileo.
Two observers, placed at a distance of several kilometers, are provided with lanterns which can be covered or uncovered by a movable screen.
The first observer uncovers his light, and the second observer answers by uncovering his at the instant of perceiving the light from the first.
If there is an interval between the uncovering of the lantern by the first observer and his perception of the return signal from the second (due allowance being made for the delay between perception and motion), the distance divided by the time interval should give the velocity of propagation.


Needless to say, the time interval was far too small to be appreciated by such imperfect appliances.
It is nevertheless worthy of note that the principle of the method is sound, and, with improvements that are almost intuitive, leads to the well-known method of Fizeau.
The first improvement would clearly be the substitution of a mirror instead of the second observer.
The second would consist in the substitution of a series of equidistant apertures in a rapidly revolving screen instead of the single screen which covers and uncovers the light.


The first actual determination of the velocity of light was made in 1675 by R&ouml;mer as a result of his observation of the eclipses of the first satellite of Jupiter.
These eclipses, recurring at very nearly equal intervals, could be calculated, and R&ouml;mer found that the observed and the calculated values showed an annual discrepancy.
The eclipses were later by an interval of sixteen minutes and twenty-six seconds 1 when the earth is farthest from Jupiter than when nearest to it.
R&ouml;mer correctly attributed this difference to the time required by light to traverse the earth&#39;s orbit.
If this be taken as 300,000,000 kilometers and the time interval as one thousand seconds, the resulting value for the velocity of light is 300,000 kilometers per second.

Another method for the determination of the velocity of light is due to Bradley, who in 1728 announced an apparent annual deviation in the direction of the fixed stars from their mean position, to which he gave the name &ldquo;aberration.&rdquo;
A star whose direction is at right angles to the earth&#39;s orbital motion appears displaced in the direction of motion by an angle of 20.445.
\footnote{
    The value originally given by R&ouml;mer, twenty-two minutes, is clearly too great.
}
This displacement Bradley attributed to the finite velocity of light.

With a telescope pointing in the true direction of such a star, during the time of passage of the light from objective to focus the telescope will have been displaced in consequence of the orbital motion of the earth so that the image of the star falls behind the crosshairs.
In order to produce coincidence, the telescope must be inclined forward at such an angle a that the tangent is equal to the ratio of the velocity v of the earth to the velocity of light,

\begin{equation*}
    \tan\alpha = \frac{v}{V}
\end{equation*}

or, since $v = \piD/T$, where <span class="math">D</span> is the diameter of the earth&#39;s orbit and <span class="math">T</span> the number of seconds in the year,
\begin{equation*}
    \tan\alpha=\frac{\pi D}{VT},
\end{equation*}

from which the velocity of light may be found; but, as is also the case with the method of R&ouml;mer, only to the degree of accuracy with which the sun&#39;s distance, $\frac{1}{2}D$, is known; that is, with an order of accuracy of about 1 per cent.
\footnote{
    The value of the velocity of light has been obtained, by experimental methods immediately to be described, with an order of accuracy of one in one hundred thousand, so that now the process is inverted, and this result is employed to find the sun&#39;s distance.
}

In 1849 Fizeau announced the result of the first experimental measurement of the velocity of light.
Two astronomical telescope objectives <span class="math">L_1</span> and <span class="math">L_2</span> (Fig. \ref{fig:73}) are placed facing each other at the two stations.
At the focus of the first is an intense but minute image a of the source of light (arc) by reflection from a plane-parallel plate <span class="math">N</span>.
The light from this image is rendered approximately parallel by the first objective.
These parallel rays, falling on the distant objective, are brought to a focus at the surface of a mirror, whence the path is retraced and an image formed which coincides with the original image <span class="math">a</span>, where it is observed by the ocular <span class="math">E</span>.
An accurately divided toothed wheel <span class="math">W</span> is given a uniform rotation,

<figure>
\label{fig:73}
</figure>

thus interrupting the passage of the light at <span class="math">a</span>.
If, on returning, the light is blocked by a tooth, it is eclipsed, to reappear at a velocity such that the next succeeding interval occupies the place of the former, and so on.


If <span class="math">n</span> is the number of teeth and <span class="math">N</span> the number of turns per second, <span class="math">K</span> the number of teeth which pass during the double journey of the light over the distance <span class="math">D</span>,
\begin{equation*}
    V = \frac{2NnD}{K}.
\begin{equation*}


It is easier to mark the minima than the maxima of intensity, and accordingly
\begin{equation*}
    K = \frac{2p-I}{2}
\end{equation*}

if <span class="math">p</span> is the order of the eclipse.
Let $\delta K$ be the error committed in the estimate of <span class="math">K</span> (practically the error in estimation of equality of intensities on the descending and the ascending branches of the intensity curve).
Then
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial V}{V} = \frac{\partial K}{K}.
\end{equation*}

Hence it is desirable to make <span class="math">K</span> as great as possible.
In Fizeau&#39;s experiments this number was 5 to 7, and should have given a result correct to about one three-hundredth.
It was, in fact, about 5 per cent too large.

A much more accurate determination was undertaken by Cornu in 1872 in which <span class="math">K</span> varied from 3 to 21, the result as given by Cornu being 300,400, with a probable error of one-tenth of 1 per cent.
In discussing Cornu&#39;s results, however, Listing showed that these tended toward a smaller value as the speed increased, and he assigns this limit as the correct value, namely, 299,950.
Perrotin, with the same apparatus, found 299,900.

Before Fizeau had concluded his experiments, another project was proposed by Arago, namely, the utilization of the revolving mirror by means of which Wheatstone had measured the speed of propagation of an electric current.
Arago&#39;s chief interest in the problem lay in the possibility of deciding the question of the relative velocities in air and water as a crucial test between the undulatory and the corpuscular theories.
He pointed out, however, the possibility of measuring the absolute velocity.


The plan was to compare the deviations of the light from an electric spark reflected directly from the revolving mirror with that which was reflected after traversing a considerable distance in air (or in water).
The difficulty in executing such an experiment lay in the uncertainty in the direction in which the two reflected images of the spark were to appear (which might be anywhere in 360 ).
This difficulty was solved by Foucault in 1862 by the following ingenious device whereby the return light is always reflected in the same direction (apart from the deviation due to the retardation which it is required to measure), notwithstanding the rotation of the mirror.

Following is the actual arrangement of apparatus by which this is effected.
Light from a source <span class="math">S</span> falls upon an objective <span class="math">L</span>, whence it proceeds to the revolving mirror <span class="math">R</span>, and is thence reflected to the concave mirror <span class="math">C</span>

<figure>
\label{fig:74}
</figure>

(whose center is at <span class="math">R</span>), where it forms a real image of the source.
It then retraces its path, forming a real image which coincides with the source even when the revolving mirror is in slow motion.
Part of the light is reflected from the plane-parallel glass <span class="math">M</span>, forming an image at a where it is observed by the micrometer eyepiece <span class="math">E</span>.

If now the revolving mirror is turning rapidly, the return image, instead of coinciding with its original position, will be deviated in the direction of rotation through an angle double that through which the mirror turns while the light makes its double transit.
If this angle is a and the distance between mirrors is <span class="math">D</span>, and the revolving mirror makes <span class="math">N</span> turns per second,
\begin{equation*}
    a = 2\pi N^2 \frac{D}{V},
\end{equation*}

or

\begin{equation*}
    V = \frac{4\pi ND}{a}.
\end{equation*}


In principle there is no essential difference between the two methods.
In the method of the toothed wheel the angle a corresponds to the passage of <span class="math">K</span> teeth, and is therefore $a = \frac{2 \pi K}{n}$, so that the formula previously found, $V = \frac{2NnD}{K}$, now becomes $V = \frac{4 \pi D}{a}$, the same as for the revolving mirror.
The latter method has, however, the same advantage over the former that the method of mirror and scale has over the direct reading of the needle of a galvanometer.


On the other hand, an important advantage for the method of the toothed wheel lies in the circumstance that the intensity of the return image is one-half of that which would appear if there were no toothed wheel,
whereas with the revolving mirror this fraction is $\frac{n\beta}{rD}$ if the mirror has <span class="math">n</span> facets), where $\beta$ is the angular aperture of the concave mirror, and <span class="math">f</span> is the focal length of the mirror, <span class="math">r</span> is the distance from slit to revolving mirror, and <span class="math">D</span> is the distance between stations.


In the actual experiments of Foucault, the greatest distance <span class="math">D</span> was only 20 meters (obtained by five reflections from concave mirrors), which, with a speed of five hundred turns per second, gives only 160&rdquo; for the angle <span class="math">2a</span> which is to be measured.
The limit of accuracy of the method is about one second, so that under these conditions the results of Foucault&#39;s measurements can hardly be expected to be accurate to one part in one hundred and sixty.
Foucault&#39;s result, 298,000, is in fact too small by this amount.
\footnote{
    Apart from the mere matter of convenience in limiting the distance <span class="math">D</span> to the insignificant 20~m (on account of the dimensions of the laboratory), it may be that this was in fact limited by the relative intensity of the return image as compared with that of the streak of light caused by the direct reflection from the revolving mirror, which in Foucault&#39;s experiments was doubtless superposed on the former.
    The intensity of the return image varies inversely as the cube of the distance, while that of the streak remains constant.
}

In order to obtain a deflection 2a sufficiently large to measure with precision it is necessary to work with a much larger distance.
The following plan renders this possible, and in a series of experiments (1878) the distance <span class="math">D</span> was about 700~m and could have been made much greater.


The image-forming lens in the new arrangement is placed between the two mirrors, and (for maximum intensity of the return image) at a distance from the revolving mirror equal to the focal length of the lens.
This necessitates a lens of long focus; for the radius of measurement <span class="math">r</span> (from which a is determined by the relation $\delta = r\tan a$, in which $\delta$ is the measured displacement of the image) is given by $r=\frac{f^2}{D}$, if <span class="math">f</span> is the focal length of the lens;
    whence <span class="math">r</span> is proportional to $f^2$.
In the actual experiment, a non-achromatic lens of 25~m focus and 20~cm diameter was employed, and with this it was found that the intensity of the return light was quite sufficient even when the revolving mirror was far removed from the principal focus.


With so large a displacement, the inclined plane-parallel plate in the Foucault arrangement may be suppressed, the direct (real) image being observed.
With 250 to 300 turns per second, a displacement of 100~mm to 150~mm was obtained which could be measured with an error of less than one ten-thousandth.

The measurement of <span class="math">D</span> presents no serious difficulty.
This was accomplished by means of a steel tape whose coefficient of stretch and of dilatation was carefully determined, and whose length under standard conditions was compared with a copy of the standard meter.
The estimated probable error was of the order of $1:200,000$.
The measurement of the speed of rotation presents some points of interest.
The optical &ldquo;beats&rdquo; between the revolving mirror and an electrically maintained tuning fork were observed at the same time that the coincidence of the deflected image with the crosshairs of the eyepiece was maintained by hand regulation of an air blast which actuated the turbine attached to the revolving mirror.
The number of vibrations of the fork <em>plus</em> the number of beats per second gives the number of revolutions per second in terms of the rate of the fork.
This, however, cannot be relied upon except for a short interval, and it was compared before and after every measurement with a standard fork.
This fork, whose temperature coefficient is well determined, is then compared, as follows, directly with a free pendulum.


For this purpose the pendulum is connected in series with a battery and the primary of an induction coil whose circuit is interrupted by means of a platinum knife edge attached to the pendulum passing through a globule of mercury.
The secondary of the induction coil sends a flash through a vacuum tube, thus illuminating the edge of the fork and the crosshair of the observing microscope.
If the fork makes an exact whole number (256) of vibrations during one swing of the pendulum, it appears at rest; but if there is a slight excess, the edge of the fork appears to execute a cycle of displacement at the rate of <span class="math">n</span> per second.
The rate of the fork is then $N\pm n$ per second of the free pendulum.
This last is finally compared with a standard astronomical clock.
\footnote{
    The average beat of such a clock may be extremely constant although the individual &ldquo;seconds&rdquo; vary considerably.
}
The order of accuracy is estimated as $1:200,000$.

The final result of the mean of two such determinations of the velocity of light made under somewhat similar conditions but at a different time and locality is 299,895.

A determination of the velocity of light by a modification of the Foucault arrangement was completed by Newcomb in 1882.
One of the essential improvements consisted in the use of a revolving steel prism with square section twice as long as wide.
This permits the sending and receiving of the light on different parts of the mirror, thus eliminating the effect of direct reflection.
It should also be mentioned that very accurate means were provided for measuring the deflection, and finally that the speed of the mirror was registered on a chronograph through a system of gears connected with the revolving mirror.
Newcomb&#39;s result is 299,860.

The original purpose of the Foucault arrangement was the testing of the question of the relative velocities of light in air and in water.
For this purpose a tube filled with water and closed with plane-parallel glasses is interposed.
There are then two return images of the source which would be superposed if the velocities were the same.
By appropriately placed diaphragms these two images may be separated, and if there is any difference in velocities this is revealed by a relative displacement in the direction of rotation.
This was found greater for the beam which had passed through the water column, and in which, therefore, the velocity must have been less.
This result is in accordance with the undulatory theory and opposed to the corpuscular theory of light.


The experiments of Foucault do not appear to have shown more than qualitative results, and it should be of interest, not only to show that the velocity of light is less in water than in air, but that the ratio of the velocities is equal to the index of refraction of the liquid.
Experiments were accordingly undertaken with water, the result obtained agreeing very nearly with the index of refraction.
But on replacing the water by carbon disulphide, the ratio of velocities obtained was 1.75 instead of 1.64, the index of refraction.
The difference is much too great to be attributed to errors of experiment.


Lord Rayleigh found the following explanation of the discrepancy.
In the method of the toothed wheel the disturbances are propagated in the form of isolated groups of wave-trains.
Rayleigh finds that the velocity of a group is not the same as that of the separate waves except in a medium without dispersion.
The simplest form of group analytically considered is that produced by two simple harmonic wave-trains of slightly different frequencies and wave-lengths.
Thus, let
\begin{equation*}
    y=\cos\left(nt - mx\right) + \cos\left(n_1 t -m_1 x\right),
\end{equation*}

in which $n = \frac{2\pi}{T}$, and $m=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, <span class="math">T</span> being the period and $\lambda$ the wave-length.
Let $n—n_1 =dn$, and $m-m_1=\partial m$.
Then

\begin{equation*}
    y=2\cos\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial nt-\partial mx\right) \cos\left(nt - mx\right)
\end{equation*}

This represents a series of groups of waves such as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:75}.

<figure>
\label{fig:75}
</figure>


The velocity of the waves is the ratio $V=\frac{n}{m}$, but the velocity of the group (e.g., the velocity of propagation of the maximum or the minimum) will be

\begin{equation*}
    V&#39; = \frac{\partial n}{\partial m},
\end{equation*}

or, since $n = mV$,
\begin{equation*}
    V&#39; = \frac{\partial\left(mV\right)}{\partial m} =
        V + m \frac{\partial V}{\partial M} =
        V\left(1+\frac{m\partial V}{V \partial m}\right),
\end{equation*}

or, since $w = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$,
\begin{equation*}
    V&#39; = V\left(1-\frac{\lambda}{v}\frac{\partial V}{\partial \lambda}\right),
\end{equation*}


The demonstration is true, not only of this particular form of group, but (by the Fourier theorem) can be applied to a group of any form.

It is not quite so clear that this expression applies to the measurements made with the revolving mirror.
Lord Rayleigh shows that in consequence of the Doppler effect there is a shortening of the waves at one edge of the beam of light reflected from the revolving mirror and a lengthening at the opposite edge, and since the velocity of propagation depends on the wave-length in a dispersive medium, there will be a rotation of the individual wavefronts.


If $\omega$ is the angular velocity of the mirror, and $\omega_1$ that of the dispersional rotation,
\begin{equation*}
    \omega_1 = \frac{dV}{dy} = \frac{dV}{d\lambda}\frac{d\lambda}{dy},
\end{equation*}

where <span class="math">y</span> is the distance from the axis of rotation.
But
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{d\lambda}{dy} = 2 \omega \frac{\lambda}{v} \therefore \omega_1=2\omega\frac{\lambda}{V}\frac{dV}{\d\lambda}.
\end{equation*}


The deflection actually observed is therefore

\begin{equation*}
    T\left(2\omega + \omega_1\right),
\end{equation*}

where <span class="math">T</span> is the time required to travel distance <span class="math">2D</span>; or

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{4D}{V}\omega\left(1+\frac{\lambda}{V}\frac{dV}{d\lambda}\right),
\end{equation*}

hence the velocity measured is
\begin{equation*}
    V&rdquo; = \frac{V}{1+\frac{\lambda}{V}\frac{dV}{d\lambda}},
\end{equation*}

or, to small quantities of the second order,
\begin{equation*}
    V" =V&#39;=\text{group velocity}
    \footnote{J. W. Gibbs {Nature, 1886) shows that the measurement is in reality exactly that of groups and not merely an approximation.}
\end{equation*}

The value of $\left(I + \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\frac{d\mu}{d\lambda}\right)$ for carbon disulphide for the mean wave-length of the visible spectrum is 0.93.
Accordingly,

\begin{equation*}
    \frac{V_0}{V&#39;} = \frac{V_0}{V} \frac{1}{0.93}  = \frac{1.64}{0.93} = 1.76,
\end{equation*}
which agrees with the value found by experiment.

<span class="textsc">REcent Measurements of the Velocity of Light</span>

In the expression for <span class="math">V</span>, the velocity of light as determined by the revolving mirror, $V=\frac{4\pi ND}{a}$, there are three quantities to be measured, namely, <span class="math">N</span>, the speed of the mirror; <span class="math">D</span>, the distance between stations; and <span class="math">a</span>, the angular displacement of the mirror.
As has already been mentioned, the values of <span class="math">N</span> and <span class="math">D</span> may be obtained to one part in one hundred thousand or less.
But <span class="math">a</span> cannot be measured to this order of accuracy.
It has been pointed out by Newcomb
\footnote{
    Measures of the Velocity of Light. Nautical Almanac Office, 1882.
}
that this difficulty may be avoided by giving the revolving mirror a prismatic form and making the distance between the two stations so great that the return light is reflected at the same angle by the next following face of the prism.


The following is an outline of a proposed attempt to realize such a project between Mount Wilson and Mount San Antonio near Pasadena, the distance being about 35~km.
For this, given a speed of rotation of 1,060 turns per second, the angular displacement of the mirror during the double journey would be $90^{\circ}$; or, if the speed were half as great, an angle of $45^{\circ}$ would suffice.
\footnote{
    It may be noted that with eight surfaces the resulting intensity will be four times as great as with the revolving plane-parallel disk.
}
Accordingly, the revolving mirror may have the form of an octagon.
It is, of course, very important that the angles should be equal, at least to the order of accuracy desired.

<figure>
    \label{fig:76}
</figure>

This has already been attained as follows.
The octagon, with faces polished and angles approximately correct, is applied to the test angle a <span class="math">V</span> made up of a $45^{\circ}$ prism cemented to a true plane.
The faces $b_1 b$ are made parallel by the interference fringes observed in monochromatic light.
In general, the faces $a_1a$ will not be parallel, and the angle between them is measured by the distance and inclination of the interference bands.
The same process is repeated for each of the eight angles, and these are corrected by repolishing until the distance and inclination are the same for all, when the corresponding angles will also be equal.
It has been found possible in this way to produce an octagon in which the average error was of the order of one-millionth, that is, about one-tenth to one-twentieth of a second.
\footnote{
    It may be noted that while a distortion may be expected when the mirror is in such rapid rotation, if the substance of the mirror (glass, in the present instance) is uniform, such distortion could only produce a very slight curvature and hence merely a minute change of focus.
}

Another difficulty arises from the direct reflection and the scattered light from the revolving mirror.
The former may be eliminated, as already mentioned, by slightly inclining the revolving mirror, but to avoid the scattered b&#39;ght it is essential that the return ray be received on a different surface from the outgoing.


<figure>
\label{fig:77}
\caption{Light path <span class="math">a</span>, <span class="math">b</span>, <span class="math">c</span>, <span class="math">d</span>, <span class="math">e</span>, <span class="math">e_1</span>, <span class="math">f_1</span>, <span class="math">l_1</span>, <span class="math">e</span>, <span class="math">f</span>, <span class="math">g</span>, <span class="math">h</span>, <span class="math">i</span>, <span class="math">j</span>}
</figure>

Again, in order to avoid the difficulty in maintaining the distant mirror perpendicular to the incident light, the return of the ray to the home station may be accomplished exactly as in the Fizeau experiment, the only precaution required being the very accurate focusing of the beam on the small plane (better, concave) mirror at the focus of the distant collimator.

Finally, it is far less expensive to make both sending and receiving collimators silvered mirrors instead of lenses.

In Figure \ref{fig:77} is shown the arrangement of apparatus which fulfilled all these requirements.


Three determinations were undertaken between the home station at the Mount Wilson Observatory and Mount San Antonio 22 miles distant.
The rate of the electric tuning fork was 132.25 vibrations per second, giving four stationary images of the revolving mirror when this was rotating at the rate of 529 turns per second.
The fork was compared before and after every set of the observations with a free pendulum whose rate was found by comparison with an invar pendulum furnished and rated by the Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The result of eight measurements in 1924 gave

\begin{equation*}
    V_a = 299,735.
\end{equation*}

Another series of observations with a direct comparison of the same electric fork with the Coast and Geodetic Survey pendulum
\footnote{
    This comparison was made by allowing the light from a very narrow slit to fall on a mirror attached to the pendulum.
    An image of the slit was formed by means of a good achromatic lens, in the plane of one edge of the fork, where it was observed by an ordinary eyepiece.
}
was completed in the summer of 1925 with a resulting value
\begin{equation*}
    V_a = 299,690.
\end{equation*}

A third series of measurements was made in which the electric fork was replaced by a free fork making 528 vibrations per second maintained by an &ldquo;auction circuit,&rdquo; thus insuring a much more nearly constant rate.
The result of this measurement gave
\begin{equation*}
    V_a = 299,704.
\end{equation*}

Giving these determinations the weights 1, 2, and 4, respectively, the result for the velocity in air is
\begin{equation*}
    V_a = 299,704.
\end{equation*}


Applying the correction of 67~km for the reduction to vacuo gives finally $V=299,771$.

This result should be considered as provisional, and depends on the value of <span class="math">D</span>, the distance between the two stations which was furnished by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and which it is hoped may be verified by a repetition of the work.


It was also found that a trial with a much larger revolving mirror gave better definition, more light, and steadier speed of rotation; so that it seems probable that results of much greater accuracy may be obtained in a future investigation.


<span class="textsc">Final MEasurements</span>

Observations with the same layout were resumed in the summer of 1926, but with an assortment of revolving mirrors.

The first of these was the same small octagonal glass mirror used in the preceding work.
The result obtained this year was $V=299,813$.
Giving this a weight 2 and the result of preceding work weight 1 gives 299,799 for the weighted mean.

The other mirrors were a steel octagon, a glass 12-sider, a steel 12-sider, and a glass 16-sider.
