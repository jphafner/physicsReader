%% NOTE: lots of tikz diagrams possible


Of all the instruments made by man, none resembles a part of his body more than a camera does the eye.
Yet this is not by design.
A camera is no more a copy of an eye than the wing of a bird is a copy of that of an insect.
Each is the product of an independent evolution; and if this has brought the camera and the eye together, it is not because one has mimicked the other, but because both have had to meet the same problems, and frequently have done so in much the same way.
This is the type of phenomenon that biologists call convergent evolution, yet peculiar in that the one evolution is organic, the other technological.


Over the centuries much has been learned about vision from the camera, but little about photography from the eye.
The camera made its first appearance not as an instrument for making pictures but as the camera obscura or dark chamber, a device that attempted no more than to project an inverted image upon a screen. 
Long after the optics of the camera obscura was well understood, the workings of the eye remained mysterious.


In part this was because men found it difficult to think in simple terms about the eye. 
It is possible for contempt to breed familiarity, but awe does not help one to understand anything. 
Men have often approached light and the eye in a spirit close to awe, probably because they were always aware that vision provides their closest link with the external world. 
Stubborn misconceptions held back their understanding of the eye for many centuries. 
Two notions were particularly troublesome. 
One was that radiation shines out of the eye; the other, that an inverted image on the retina is somehow incompatible with seeing right side up.


I am sure that many people are still not clear on either matter. 
I note, for example, that the X-ray vision of the comic-strip hero Superman, while regarded with skepticism by many adults, is not rejected on the ground that there are no X-rays about us with which to see. 
Clearly Superman&#39;s eyes supply the X-rays, and by directing them here and there he not only can see through opaque objects, but can on occasion shatter a brick wall or melt gold. 
As for the in- verted image on the retina, most people who learn of it concede that it presents a problem, but comfort themselves with the thought that the brain somehow compensates for it. 
But of course there is no problem, and hence no compensation. 
We learn early in infancy to associate certain spatial relations in the outside world with certain patterns of nervous activity stimulated through the eyes. 
The spatial arrangements of the nervous activity itself are altogether irrelevant.


It was not until the 17th century that the gross optics of image formation in the eye was clearly expressed. 
This was accomplished by Johannes Kepler in 1611, and again by Rene Descartes in 1664. 
By the end of the century the first treatise on optics in English, written by William Molyneux of Dublin, contained several clear and simple diagrams comparing the projection of a real inverted image in a &ldquo;pinhole&rdquo; camera, in a camera obscura equipped with a lens and in an eye.


Today every schoolboy knows that the eye is like a camera. 
In both instruments a lens projects an inverted image of the surroundings upon a light-sensitive surface: the film in the camera and the retina in the eye. 
In both the opening of the lens is regulated by an iris. 
In both the inside of the chamber is lined with a coating of black material which absorbs stray light that would otherwise be reflected back and forth and obscure the image. 
Almost every schoolboy also knows a difference between the camera and the eye. 
A camera is focused by moving the lens toward or away from the film; in the eye the distance between the lens and the retina is fixed, and focusing is accomplished by changing the thickness of the lens.


The usual fate of such comparisons is that on closer examination they are exposed as trivial. 
In this case, however, just the opposite has occurred. 
The more we have come to know about the mechanism of vision, the more pointed and fruitful has become its comparison with photography. 
By now it is clear that the relationship between the eye and the camera goes far beyond simple optics, and has come to involve much of the essential physics and chemistry of both devices.

## Bright and Dim Ligh

A photographer making an exposure in dim light opens the iris of his camera.
The pupil of the eye also opens in dim light, to an extent governed by the activity of the retina. 
Both adjustments have the obvious effect of admitting more light through the lens. 
This is accomplished at some cost to the quality of the image, for the open lens usually defines the image less sharply, and has less depth of focus.


When further pressed for light, the photographer changes to a more sensitive film. 
This ordinarily involves a further loss in the sharpness of the picture.
With any single type of emulsion the more sensitive film is coarser in grain, and thus the image cast upon it is resolved less accurately.


The retina of the eye is grainy just as is photographic film. 
In film the grain is composed of crystals of silver bromide embedded in gelatin. 
In the retina it is made up of the receptor cells, lying side by side to form a mosaic of light-sensitive elements.


There are two kinds of receptors in the retinas of man and most vertebrates: rods and cones. 
Each is composed of an inner segment much like an ordinary nerve cell, and a rod- or cone-shaped outer segment, the special portion of the cell that is sensitive to light. 
The cones are the organs of vision in bright light, and also of color vision. 
The rods provide a special apparatus for vision in dim light, and their excitation yields only neutral gray sensations. 
This is why at night all cats are gray.


The change from cone to rod vision, like that from slow to fast film, involves a change from a fine- to a coarse-grained mosaic. 
It is not that the cones are smaller than the rods, but that the cones act individually while the rods act in large clumps. 
Each cone is usually connected with the brain by a single fiber of the optic nerve. 
In contrast large clusters of rods are connected by single optic nerve fibers. 
The capacity of rods for image vision is correspondingly coarse. 
It is not only true that at night all cats are gray, but it is difficult to be sure that they are cats.


Vision in very dim light, such as starlight or most moonlight, involves only the rods. 
The relatively insensitive cones are not stimulated at all. 
At moderately low intensities of light, about 1,000 times greater than the lowest intensity to which the eye responds, the cones begin to function. 
Their entrance is marked bv dilute sensations of color. 
Over an intermediate range of intensities rods and cones function together, but as the brightness increases, the cones come to dominate vision. 
We do not know that the rods actually stop functioning at even the highest intensities, but in bright light their relative contribution to vision falls to so low a level as to be almost negligible.

To this general transfer of vision from rods to cones certain cold-blooded animals add a special anatomical device.
The light-sensitive outer segments of the rods and cones are carried at the ends of fine stalks called myoids, which can shorten and lengthen. 
In dim light the rod myoids contract while the cone myoids relax. 
The entire field of rods is thus pulled forward toward the light, while the cones are pushed into the background. 
In bright light the reverse occurs: the cones are pulled forward and the rods pushed back. 
One could scarcely imagine a closer approach to the change from fast to slow film in a camera.


The rods and cones share with the grains of the photographic plate another deeply significant property. 
It has long been known that in a film exposed to light each grain of silver bromide given enough developer blackens either completely or not at all, and that a grain is made susceptible to development by the absorption of one or at most a few quanta of light. 
It appears to be equally true that a cone or rod is excited by light to yield either its maximal response or none at all. 
This is certainly true of the nerve fibers to which the rods and cones are connected, and we now know that to produce this effect in a rod&emdash;and possibly also in a cone&emdash;only one quantum of light need be absorbed.


It is a basic tenet of photochemistry that one quantum of light is absorbed by, and in general can activate, only one molecule or atom. 
We must attempt to understand how such a small beginning can bring about such a large result as the development of a photographic grain or the discharge of a retinal receptor.
In the photographic process the answer to this question seems to be that the absorption of a quantum of light causes the oxidation of a silver ion to an atom of metallic silver, which then serves as a catalytic center for the development of the entire grain. 
It is possible that a similar mechanism operates in a rod or a cone. 
The absorption of a quantum of light by a light-sensitive molecule in either structure might convert it into a biological catalyst, or an enzyme, which could then promote the further reactions that discharge the receptor cell. 
One wonders whether such a mechanism could possibly be rapid enough. 
A rod or a cone responds to light within a small fraction of a second; the mechanism would therefore have to complete its work within this small interval.


One of the strangest characteristics of the eye in dim light follows from some of these various phenomena. 
In focusing the eye is guided by its evaluation of the sharpness of the image on the retina. 
As the image deteriorates with the opening of the pupil in dim light, and as the retinal capacity to resolve the image falls with the shift from cones to rods, the ability to focus declines also. 
In very dim light the eye virtually ceases to adjust its focus at all. 
It has come to resemble a very cheap camera, a fixed-focus instrument.


In all that concerns its function, therefore, the eye is one device in bright light and another in dim. 
At low intensities all its resources are concentrated upon sensitivity, at whatever sacrifice of form; it is predominantly an instrument for seeing light, not pattern. 
In bright light all this changes. By narrowing the pupil, shifting from rods to cones, and other stratagems still to be described, the eye sacrifices light in order to achieve the utmost in pattern vision.  

## Images

In the course of evolution animals have used almost everv known device for forming or evaluating an image.
There is one notable exception: no animal has yet developed an eye based upon the use of a concave mirror. 
An eye made like a pinhole camera, however, is found in Nautilus, a cephalopod mollusk related to the octopus and squid.
The compound eye of insects and crabs forms an image which is an upright patchwork of responses of individual &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; or ommatidia, each of which records only a spot of light or shade.
The eye of the tiny arthropod Copilia possesses a large and beautiful lens but only one light receptor attached to a thin strand of muscle. 
It is said that the muscle moves the receptor rapidly back and forth in the focal plane of the lens, scanning the image in much the same way as it is scanned by the light-sensitive tube of a television camera.


Each of these eyes, like the lens eye of vertebrates, represents some close compromise of advantages and limitations. 
The pinhole eye is in focus at all distances, yet to form clear images it must use a small hole admitting very little light. 
The compound eye works well at distances of a few millimeters, yet it is relatively coarse in pattern resolution. 
The vertebrate eye is a longrange, high-acuitv instrument useless in the short distances at which the insect eye resolves the greatest detail.


These properties of the vertebrate eye are of course shared by the camera. 
The use of a lens to project an image, however, has created for both devices a special group of problems. 
All simple lenses are subject to serious errors in image formation: the lens aberrations.


Spherical aberration is found in all lenses bounded by spherical surfaces.
The marginal portions of the lens bring rays of light to a shorter focus than the central region. 
The image of a point in space is therefore not a point, but a little &ldquo;blur circle.&rdquo;
The cost of a camera is largely determined by the extent to which this aberration is corrected by modifying the lens.

</figure>


The human eye is astonishingly well corrected&emdash;often slightly overcorrected&emdash;for spherical aberration. 
This is accomplished in two ways. 
The cornea, which is the principal refracting surface of the eye, has a flatter curvature at its margin than at its center. 
This compensates in part for the tendency of a spherical surface to refract light more strongly at its margin. 
More important still, the lens is denser and hence refracts light more strongly at its core than in its outer layers.


A second major lens error, however, remains almost uncorrected in the human eye. 
This is chromatic aberration, or color error. 
All single lenses made of one material refract rays of short wavelength more strongly than those of longer wavelength, and so bring blue light to a shorter focus than red. 
The result is that the image of a point of white light is not a white point, but a blur circle fringed with color. 
Since this seriously disturbs the image, even the lenses of inexpensive cameras are corrected for chromatic aberration.


It has been known since the time of Isaac Newton, however, that the human eye has a large chromatic aberration. 
Its lens system seems to be entirely uncorrected for this defect. 
Indeed, living organisms are probably unable to manufacture two transparent materials of such widely different refraction and dispersion as the crown and flint glasses from which color-corrected lenses are constructed.


The large color error of the human eye could make serious difficulties for image vision. 
Actually the error is moderate between the red end of the spectrum and the blue-green, but it increases rapidly at shorter wavelengths: the blue, violet and ultraviolet. 
These latter parts of the spectrum present the most serious problem. 
It is a problem for both the eye and the camera, but one for which the eye must find a special solution.


The first device that opposes the color error of the human eye is the yellow lens.
The human lens is not only a lens but a color filter. 
It passes what we ordinarily consider to be the visible spectrum, but sharply cuts off the far edge of the violet, in the region of wavelength 400 millimicrons. 
It is this action of the lens, and not any intrinsic lack of sensitivity of the rods and cones, that keeps us from seeing in the near ultraviolet. 
Indeed, persons who have lost their lenses in the operation for cataract and have had them replaced by clear glass lenses, have excellent vision in the ultraviolet. 
They are able to read an optician&#39;s chart from top to bottom in ultraviolet light which leaves ordinary people in complete darkness.


The lens therefore solves the problem of the near ultraviolet, the region of the spectrum in which the color error is greatest, simply by eliminating the region from human vision. 
This boon is distributed over one&#39;s lifetime, for the lens becomes a deeper yellow and makes more of the ordinary violet and blue invisible as one grows older. 
I have heard it said that for this reason aging artists tend to use less blue and violet in their paintings.


The lens filters out the ultraviolet for the eye as a whole. 
The remaining devices which counteract chromatic aberration are concentrated upon vision in bright light, upon cone vision. 
This is good economy, for the rods provide such a coarse-grained receptive surface that they would be unable in any case to evaluate a sharp image on the retina.


As one goes from dim to bright light, from rod to cone vision, the sensitivity of the eye shifts toward the red end of the spectrum. 
This phenomenon was described in 1825 by the Czech physiologist Johannes Purkinje. 
He had noticed that with the first light of dawn blue objects tend to look relatively bright compared with red, but that they come to look relatively dim as the morning advances. 
The basis of this change is a large difference in spectral sensitivity between rods and cones. 
Rods have their maximal sensitivity in the blue-green at about 500 millimicrons; the entire spectral sensitivity of the cones is transposed toward the red, the maximum lying in the yellow-green at about 562 millimicrons. 
The point of this difference for our present argument is that as one goes from dim light, in which pattern vision is poor in any case, to bright light, in which it becomes acute, the sensitivity of the eye moves away from the region of the spectrum in which the chromatic aberration is large toward the part of the spectrum in which it is least.  
The color correction of the eye is completed by a third dispensation. 
Toward the center of the human retina there is a small, shallow depression called the fovea, which contains only cones. 
While the retina as a whole sweeps through a visual angle of some 240 degrees, the fovea subtends an angle of only about 1.7 degrees. 
The fovea is considerably smaller than the head of a pin, yet with this tiny patch of retina the eye accomplishes all its most detailed vision.


The fovea also includes the fixation point of the eye. 
To look directly at something is to turn one&#39;s eye so that its image falls upon the fovea. 
Beyond the boundary of the fovea rods appear, and they become more and more numerous as the distance from the fovea increases. 
The apparatus for vision in bright light is thus concentrated toward the center of the retina, that for dim light toward its periphery. 
In very dim light, too dim to excite the cones, the fovea is blind. One can see objects then only by looking at them slightly askance to catch their images on areas rich in rods.


In man, apes and monkeys, alone of all known mammals, the fovea and the region of retina just around it is colored yellow. 
This area is called the yellow patch, or macula lutca. 
Its pigmentation lies as a yellow screen over the light receptors of the central retina, subtending a visual angle some five to 10 degrees in diameter.


Several years ago in our laboratory at Harvard University we measured the color transmission of this pigment in the living human eye by comparing the spectral sensitivities of cones in the yellow patch with those in a colorless peripheral area. 
The yellow pigment was also extracted from a small number of human maculae, and was found to be xanthophyll, a carotenoid pigment that occurs also in all green leaves. 
This pigment in the yellow patch takes up the absorption of light in the violet and blue regions of the spectrum just where absorption by the lens falls to very low values. 
In this way the yellow patch removes for the central retina the remaining regions of the spectrum for which the color error is high.


So the human eye, unable to correct its color error otherwise, throws away those portions of the spectrum that would make the most trouble. 
The yellow lens removes the near ultraviolet for the eye as a whole, the macular pigment eliminates most of the violet and blue for the central retina, and the shift from rods to cones displaces vision in bright light bodily toward the red. 
By these three devices the apparatus of most acute vision avoids the entire range of the spectrum in which the chromatic aberration is large.


## Photography with Living Eyes

In 1876 Franz Boll of the University of Rome discovered in the rods of the frog retina a brilliant red pigment. 
This bleached in the light and was resynthesized in the dark, and so fulfilled the elementary requirements of a visual pigment. 
He called this substance visual red; later it was renamed visual purple or rhodopsin. 
This pigment marks the point of attack by light on the rods: the absorption of light by rhodopsin initiates the train of reactions that end in rod vision.


Boll had scarcely announced his discovery when Willy Kiihne, professor of physiology at Heidelberg, took up the study of rhodopsin, and in one extraordinary year learned almost everything about it that was known until recently.
In his first paper on retinal chemistry Kiihne said: &ldquo;Bound together with the pigment epithelium, the retina behaves not merely like a photographic plate, but like an entire photographic workshop, in which the workman continually renews the plate by laying on new light-sensitive material, while simultaneously erasing the old image.&rdquo;

K&uuml;hne saw at once that with this pigment which was bleached by hght it might be possible to take a picture with the living eye. 
He set about devising methods for carrying out such a process, and succeeded after many discouraging failures. 
He called the process optography and its products optograms.


One of K&uuml;hne&#39;s early optograms was made as follows. 
An albino rabbit was fastened with its head facing a barred window. 
From this position the rabbit could see only a gray and clouded sky.
The animal&#39;s head was covered for several minutes with a cloth to adapt its eyes to the dark, that is to let rhodopsin accumulate in its rods. 
Then the animal was exposed for three minutes to the light. 
It was immediately decapitated, the eye removed and cut open along the equator, and the rear half of the eyeball containing the retina laid in a solution of alum for fixation. 
The next day K&uuml;hne saw, printed upon the retina in bleached and unaltered rhodopsin, a picture of the window with the clear pattern of its bars.


I remember reading as a boy a detective story in which at one point the detective enters a dimly lighted room, on the floor of which a corpse is lying.
Working carefully in the semidarkness, the detective raises one eyelid of the victim and snaps a picture of the open eye. 
Upon developing this in his darkroom he finds that he has an optogram of the last scene viewed by the victim, including of course an excellent likeness of the murderer. 
So far as I know K&uuml;hne&#39;s optograms mark the closest approach to fulfilling this legend.


The legend itself has nonetheless flourished for more than 60 years, and all of my readers have probably seen or heard some version of it. 
It began with K&uuml;hne&#39;s first intimation that the eye resembles a photographic workshop, even before he had succeeded in producing his first primitive optogram, and it spread rapidly over the entire world. 
In the paper that announces his first success in optography, K&uuml;hne refers to this story with some bitterness.
He says: &ldquo;1 disregard all the journalistic potentialities of this subject, and willingly surrender it in advance to all the claims of fancy-free coroners on both sides of the ocean, for it certainly is not pleasant to deal with a serious problem in such company. 
Much that I could say about this had better be suppressed, and turned rather to the hope that no one will expect from me any corroboration of announcements that have not been authorized with my name.&rdquo;


Despite these admirable sentiments we find Kiihne shortly afterward engaged in a curious adventure. 
In the nearby town of Bruchsal on November 16, 1880, a young man was beheaded by guillotine. 
K&uuml;hne had made arrangements to receive the corpse. 
He had prepared a dimly lighted room screened with red and yellow glass to keep any rhodopsin left in the eyes from bleaching further. 
Ten minutes after the knife had fallen he obtained the whole retina from the left eye, and had the satisfaction of seeing and showing to several colleagues a sharply demarcated optogram printed upon its surface. 
K&uuml;hne&#39;s drawing of it is reproduced at the bottom of the next page. 
To my knowledge it is the only human optogram on record.
Kiihne went to great pains to determine what this optogram represented.
He says: &ldquo;A search for the object which served as source for this optogram remained fruitless, in spite of a thorough inventory of all the surroundings and reports from many witnesses. 
The delinquent had spent the night awake by the light of a tallow candle; he had slept from four to five o&#39;clock in the morning; and had read and written, first by candlelight until dawn, then by feeble daylight until eight o&#39;clock. 
When he emerged in the open, the sun came out for an instant, according to a reliable observer, and the sky became somewhat brighter during the seven minutes prior to the bandaging of his eyes and his execution, which followed immediately.
The delinquent, however, raised his eyes only rarely.&rdquo;


## Color

One of the triumphs of modern photography is its success in recording color.
For this it is necessary not only to graft some system of color differentiation and rendition upon the photographic process; the finished product must then fulfill the very exacting requirement that it excite the same sensations of color in the human eye as did the original subject of the picture.  


How the human eye resolves colors is not known. 
Normal human color vision seems to be compounded of three kinds of responses; we therefore speak of it as trichromatic or three-color vision. 
The three kinds of response call for at least three kinds of cone differing from one another in their sensitivity to the various regions of the spectrum. 
We can only guess at what regulates these differences.
The simplest assumption is that the human cones contain three different light-sensitive pigments, but this is still a matter of surmise.


There exist retinas, however, in which one can approach the problem of color vision more directly. 
The eyes of certain turtles and of certain birds such as chickens and pigeons contain a great predominance of cones. 
Since cones are the organs of vision in bright light as well as of color vision, these animals necessarily function only at high light intensities.
They are permanently night-blind, due to a poverty or complete absence of rods.
It is for this reason that chickens must roost at sundown.

    He had exposed the eye of a living rabbit to a barred window, killed the rabbit, removed its retina and fixed it in alum.
}
</figure>


In the cones of these animals we find a system of brilliantly colored oil globules, one in each cone. 
The globule is situated at the joint between the inner and outer segments of the cone, so that light must pass through it just before entering the light-sensitive element. 
The globules therefore lie in the cones in the position of little individual color filters.


One has only to remove the retina from a chicken or a turtle and spread it on the stage of a microscope to tee that the globules are of three colors: red, orange and greenish yellow. 
It was suggested many years ago that they provide the basis of color differentiation in the animals that possess them.  


In a paper published in 1907 the German ophthalmologist Siegfried Garten remarked that he was led by such retinal color filters to invent a system of color photography based upon the same principle. 
This might have been the first instance in which an eye had directly inspired a development in photography.
Unfortunately, however, in 1906 the French chemist Louis Lumiere, apparently without benefit of chicken retinas, had brought out his autochrome process for color photography based upon exactly this principle. 


To make his autochrome plates Lumiere used suspensions of starch grains from rice, which he dyed red, green and blue. 
These were mixed in roughly equal proportions, and the mixture was strewn over the surface of an ordinary photographic plate. 
The granules were then squashed flat and the interstices were filled with particles of carbon. 
Each dyed granule served as a color filter for the patch of silver-bromide emulsion that lay just under it.


Just as the autochrome plate can accomplish color photography with a single light-sensitive substance, so the cones of the chicken retina should require no more than one light-sensitive pigment.
We extracted such a pigment from the chicken retina in 1937. 
It is violet in color, and has therefore been named iodopsin from ion, the Greek word for violet. 
All three pigments of the colored oil globules have also been isolated and crystallized. 
Like the pigment of the human macula, they are all carotenoids: a greenish-yellow carotene; the golden mixture of xanthophylls found in chicken egg yolk; and red astaxanthin, the pigment of the boiled lobster.


Controversy thrives on ignorance, and we have had many years of disputation regarding the number of kinds of cone concerned in human color vision. 
Many investigators prefer three, some four, and at least one of my English colleagues seven. I myself incline toward three. 
It is a good number, and sufficient unto the day.


The appearance of three colors of oil globule in the cones of birds and turtles might be thought to provide strong support for trichromatic theories of color vision. 
The trouble is that these retinas do in fact contain a fourth class of globule which is colorless. 
Colorless globules have all the effect of a fourth color; there is no doubt that if we include them, bird and turtle retinas possess the basis for four-color vision.

## Latent Images

Recent experiments have exposed a wholly unexpected parallel between vision and photography. 
Many years ago Kiihne showed that rhodopsin can be extracted from the retinal rods into clear water solution. 
When such solutions are exposed to light, the rhodopsin bleaches just as it does in the retina.

It has been known for some time that the bleaching of rhodopsin in solution is not entirely accomplished by light. 
It is started bv light, but then goes on in the dark for as long as an hour at room temperature. 
Bleaching is therefore a composite process. 
It is ushered in by a light reaction that converts rhodopsin to a highly unstable product; this then decomposes by ordinary chemical reactions&emdash;&ldquo;dark&rdquo; reactions in the sense that they do not require light. 


Since great interest attaches to the initial unstable product of the light reaction, many attempts were made in our laboratory and at other laboratories to seize upon this substance and learn its properties. 
It has such a fleeting existence, however, that for some time nothing satisfactory was achieved.


In 1941, however, two English workers, E. E. Broda and C. F. Goodeve, succeeded in isolating the light reaction by irradiating rhodopsin solutions at about &minus;73 degrees Celsius, roughly the temperature of dry ice. 
In such extreme cold, light reactions are unhindered, but ordinary dark processes cannot occur.
Broda and Goodeve found that an exhaustive exposure of rhodopsin to light under these conditions produced only a very small change in its color, so small that though it could be measured one might not have been certain merely by looking at these solutions that any change had occurred at all. 
Yet the light reaction had been completed, and when such solutions were allowed to warm up to room temperature they bleached in the dark. 
We have recently repeated such experiments in our laboratory. 
With some differences which need not be discussed, the results were qualitatively as the English workers had described them. 


These observations led us to re-examine certain early experiments of K&uuml;hne&#39;s.
K&uuml;hne had found that if the retina of a frog or rabbit was thoroughly dried over sulfuric acid, it could be exposed even to brilliant sunlight for long periods without bleaching. 
K&uuml;hne concluded that dry rhodopsin is not affected by light, and this has been the common understanding of workers in the field of vision ever since.


It occurred to us, however, that dry rhodopsin, like extremely cold rhodopsin. 
might undergo the light reaction, though with such small change in color as to have escaped notice. 
To test this possibility we prepared films of rhodopsin in gelatin, which could be dried thoroughly and were of a quality that permitted making accurate measurements of their color transmission throughout the spectrum.


We found that when dry gelatin films of rhodopsin are exposed to light, the same change occurs as in very cold rhodopsin. 
The color is altered, but so slightly as easily to escape visual observation. 
In any case the change cannot be described as bleaching; if anything the color is a little intensified. 
Yet the light reaction is complete; if such exposed films are merely wetted with water, they bleach in the dark. 


We have therefore two procedures&emdash;cooling to very low temperatures and removal of water&emdash;that clearly separate the light from the dark reactions in the bleaching of rhodopsin. 
Which of these reactions is responsible for stimulating rod vision? 
One cannot yet be certain, yet the response of the rods to light occurs so rapidly that only the light reaction seems fast enough to account for it. 


What has been said, however, has a further consequence that brings it into direct relation with photography. 
Everyone knows that the photographic process also is divided into light and dark components. 
The result of exposing a film to light is usually invisible, a so-called &ldquo;latent image.&rdquo; 
It is what later occurs in the darkroom, the dark reaction of development, that brings out the picture.


This now appears to be exactly what happens in vision. 
Here as in photography light produces an almost invisible result, a latent image, and this indeed is probably the process upon which retinal excitation depends. 
The visible loss of rhodopsin&#39;s color, its bleaching, is the result of subsequent dark reactions, of &ldquo;development.&rdquo;


One can scarcely have notions like this without wanting to make a picture with a rhodopsin film; and we have been tempted into making one very crude rhodopsin photograph. 
Its subject is not exciting&emdash;only a row of black and white stripes&emdash;but we show it at the right for what interest it may have as the first such photograph. 
What is important is that it was made in typically photographic stages. 
The dry rhodopsin film was first exposed to light, producing a latent image. 
It was then developed in the dark by wetting. 
It then had to be fixed; and, though better ways are known, we fixed this photograph simply by redrying it. 
Since irradiated rhodopsin bleaches rather than blackens on development, the immediate result is a positive.


Photography with rhodopsin is only in its first crude stages, perhaps at the level that photography with silver bromide reached almost a century ago.
I doubt that it has a future as a practical process. 
For us its primary interest is to pose certain problems in visual chemistry in a provocative form. 
It does, however, also add another chapter to the mingled histories of eye and camera.

    <span class="textsc">Rhodopsin Photograph</span> was made by the author and his associates Paul K. Brown and Oscar Starobin.
    Rhodopsin, the light-sensitive red pigment of rod vision, had been extracted from cattle retinas, mixed with gelatin and spread on celluloid. 
    This was then dried and exposed to a pattern made up of black and white stripes.
    When the film was wetted in the dark with hydroxylamine, the rhodopsin bleached in the same pattern.
