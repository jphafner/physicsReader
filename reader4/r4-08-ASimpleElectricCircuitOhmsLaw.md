We shall then try to build up a theory that accounts for our observations.


## A Simple Series Circuit: Measurement of Potential Difference
\label{sec:40.1}

Figure \ref{fig:40.1} shows what our apparatus looks like: <var>A</var>, a six-volt storage battery; <var>B</var>, a lamp in a socket; <var>C</var>, a knife switch; <var>D</var>, a voltmeter; <var>E</var>, an ammeter; <var>F</var>, some connecting wires.
From now on we shall, as much as possible, use the shorthand of conventional diagrams, as in Figure \ref{fig:40.2}, which shows battery <var>A</var>, lamp <var>B</var> (the zigzag line is actually the symbol for an element with resistance), and switch <var>C</var> connected in series.
When the switch is closed, the lamp lights up.
We say that there is an electric current or that there is a flow of electric charge, but we don&#39;t, of course, see anything flowing.
The fact that the bulb lights up when the switch is closed is the only outward sign that anything flows.


It is not uncommon to begin such an experiment with little or no knowledge of what is inside the magic boxes <var>A</var>, <var>B</var>, <var>D</var>, and <var>E</var> (Fig. \ref{fig:40.1}).
All we know is that <var>D</var> measures potential difference and that E measures current. In this chapter we shall look inside <var>B</var>, <var>D</var>, and <var>E</var>.
The battery, <var>A</var>, however, will have to remain just an electron pump; I shall leave its inner details out of the discussion because they involve the complicated molecular mechanism by which chemical energy is converted into electrical energy.

We want to understand why the voltmeter readings of Figure \ref{fig:40.3} are what they are at different places.
We are going to limit ourselves in this chapter to an understanding of the simple circuit of Figure \ref{fig:40.2}.
We shall move more slowly than is customary in a chapter on electric circuits, and only when we peek inside the voltmeter and the ammeter shall we see slightly more complicated circuits in series and in parallel.
Our immediate objective is limited; but, if you understand all the details of this discussion, you will have a firm grasp of fundamentals.

We first notice, as we consider the reading of the voltmeter in different parts of Figure \ref{fig:40.3}, that we do not need to disturb the circuit when we take a voltmeter reading.
We simply connect the voltmeter to two points of the circuit.


Next we observe and record the data, and then we try to explain them by theory.
When the voltmeter (Fig. \ref{fig:40.3}) is connected across the battery (A), it reads 6~volts if the switch is open; with the switch closed (B) it reads 5.45~volts.
Connected across the lamp, it reads if the switch is open (C) and 5.45~volts if the switch is closed (D).
Connected across one of the connecting wires, it reads whether the switch is open (E) or closed (F).

If the voltmeter is telling the truth, the potential difference across the terminals of the battery is 6 volts when there is no current in the circuit (A).
The potential difference across the battery drops when there is current (B).
There is no potential difference across the terminals of the lamp (C) until the switch is closed (D), and there is never a measurable potential difference across one of the connecting wires.
Our theory of what is going on must account for all these readings (and a lot more).

Let&#39;s begin our description of what we think is going on. We have already encountered a momentary flow of charge in electrostatic experiments, but something different is obviously happening here, for this current can flow for a long time.
Something replenishes the charge; something maintains a potential difference that produces a steady flow of charge.
This something, in our experiment, is the battery.
The terminals of the battery are charged in the very sense in which we used the word in electrostatics.
If our battery has only two terminals, an electric field surrounds them as if they constituted an electric dipole.
Figure \ref{fig:40.4}.A shows the electric field between the two battery terminals.
It looks very much like the electric field between two charged metal balls on insulating stands; but there is a difference in what happens to these fields if the terminals are connected with a wire.
A wire connecting one charged ball to the other would carry current only for an instant, for the potential difference between them would soon be zero, and the field would vanish.
If the terminals of the battery are connected, a large current can exist in the wire for a much longer time, and the field between the terminals will still be like that of Figure \ref{fig:40.4}.A after the wire is removed.
In Figure \ref{fig:40.4}.B we see the electric field lines (E) that come into existence within the wire that runs from one terminal through the lamp to the other terminal.
I said earlier that there can be no electric field within a conductor, but that is true only in the electrostatic case.
Charges move in the wire of Figure \ref{fig:40.4}.B because there is an electric field within it.

Since the lamp gets hot, it is obvious that energy is involved.
It looks very much as if something were playing the role that friction plays in mechanics.
Something is playing that role; it is called resistance (defined in § 40.3), and we shall soon consider it in some detail.

Let us now recall the definition of electric field, <b>E</b>, as <b>F<b>/<var>q</var>, the force per unit charge (§ 4.4).
An electron finding itself in electric field <b>E</b> experiences the force <b>F=&minus;e<b>E</b>.
It should experience the acceleration <i>a</i>=<b>F</b>&#8725;<i>m</i>, and it does, but it cannot pick up much speed, for it collides with other electrons.
The average behavior of many electrons, starting and stopping, is, nevertheless, a general drift in the direction of&emdash;<i>e</i><b>E</b>.
Statistically, the free electrons drift at an average speed determined by the magnitude of the force&emdash;<i>e</i><b>E</b>.

The idea of motion at a constant speed under the action of balanced forces can be perfectly illustrated by the falling of small spheres (such as marbles) through a tall glass beaker containing glycerin (Fig. 40.5.A); balls of the right weight and dimensions achieve a terminal velocity.
The force of gravity, <var>mg</var>, pulls them downward, but a viscous frictional force, <var>f</var>, pushes them upward.
When <i>mg</i>=<i>f</i>, the acceleration is zero (see § 5.2).

A positive charge, <var>q</var>, in electric field <b>E</b> feels the force <i>q</i><b>E</b> (Fig. \ref{fig:40.5}.B).
If it also feels an equal retarding force, <var>f</var>, it can move at a constant speed.
What happens in a wire is somewhat like this.
For two reasons, however, you must not take any such picture literally.
First, no electron travels for long without hitting another, and the concept of drift velocity is therefore purely statistical.
(It takes a lot of kinetic energy to carry an electron into contact with another, even when the other is anchored to an atom.
What I have called hitting just means being decelerated by a force field.
Here it would pay you to re-read § 3.7, dealing with the concept of contact.)
Second, electrons have a negative charge and move opposite to <b>E</b>, but this does not damage the model of Figure \ref{fig:40.5}.

\label{fig:40.5}
\caption{

</figure>


Traditionally, the direction of current in a wire has been taken as from the positive to the negative pole (in the part of the circuit outside the battery).
In this book, since it is now known that in a wire the electrons do the moving, I have broken with tradition by assigning to / the direction of electron flow.
But I shall use the symbol <i>I</i>(=&minus;<i>i</i>) for the conventional direction (from positive to negative) whenever it can simplify the wording of statements.
All the left-hand rules I gave in the study of magnetism relate to <var>i</var>.
If we associate the <em>right hand</em> with <var>I</var> similar rules apply.
In other words, <var>I</var> is the direction in which positive charges would move in a wire.
Since positive charges tend to move from a region of high electric potential to one of low potential, it is convenient to use the traditional symbol for current, <var>I</var>, in these cases.
(We simply need to remember that the electrons in metallic conductors move in the opposite direction; in liquids, however, positive as well as negative charged bodies move.)
Whenever we use the symbol <var>q</var> without any further specification, it will represent a positive charge.
The electronic charge will, of course, be written as <var>&minus;e</var>.

There are two ways of expressing the reason why a ball moves downward through the beaker of glycerin.
One is to say that it moves down because wg points downward; the other is to say that it has a tendency to move from a region of high potential to one of low potential.
The same language applies to positive charges in an electric field: they move from A to B in Figure 40.5.B because <i>q</i><b>E</b> points that way, or (since an applied force would do work in moving a positive charge from B to A) they move from a region of high potential to one of low potential.

Potential difference, <var>V</var>, is measured in volts, which we identified earlier (§ 37.2) with joules per coulomb.
The work that will move charge <var>&Delta;q</var> through distance <var>x</var> from B to A is (by the formula &ldquo;work equals force times distance&rdquo;) &Delta;<i>U</i> = (&Delta;<i>q</i>)<b>E</b><i>x</i>.
The work per unit charge is $\Delta U/\Delta q = Ex$.
The lefthand side has the units joules per coulomb, or volts.
The right-hand side has newtons per coulomb times meters for units.
This equivalence is worth remembering.
We may write

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.1}
    V = Ex
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.2}
    E = V/x
\end{equation}

Now we are getting somewhere.
The quantities on the right-hand side of the second equation are measurable, <var>V</var> with a voltmeter (we&#39;d better find out how it works), <var>x</var> with a meter stick.

If we connected a voltmeter across points <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> of Figure \ref{fig:40.5}.B, would it show a reading?
I said earlier (Fig. \ref{fig:40.3}.F) that there is no detectable reading across a wire carrying current.
You will have to take my word for it that a certain very sensitive kind of voltmeter would indicate a small potential difference between points <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> if there were a current in the wire.

<span class="textsc">EXAMPLE 40.1</span>.
A sensitive voltmeter indicates a potential difference of $10^{-6}$~volt between points <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> of Fig. 40.5. B.
The distance between the points is $x = 2\,\text{meter}$.
We wish to know (1) what force, in newtons, an electron feels within the wire; (2) what acceleration it experiences; (3) what the increment in its speed is if it travels for $10^{-7}$~seconds.

1. The force on a charge, <var>q</var>, is $F = Eq$.
Since, by equation \ref{eq:40.2}, $E = V/x$, we know that $F = Vq/x$.
We are given that

\begin{align*}
    V &= 10^{-6}\,\text{volt}  \\
    q &= -e = 1.60\times 10^{-19}\,\text{coulomb}   \\
    x &= 2\,\text{meter}
\end{align*}

Therefore, if we drop the minus sign,

\begin{align*}
    F &= \frac{10^{-6}\times 1.60\times 10^{-19}}{2}\,nt \\
      &= 8\times 10^{-26}\,nt
\end{align*}

2. The acceleration is $a=\frac{F}{m}$. We know that
\begin{align*}
    F &= 8\times 10^{-26}\,\text{nt} \\
    m &= 9.11\times 10^{-31}\,\text{kilogram}
\end{align*}

Therefore

\begin{align*}
    a &= \frac{8\times 10^{-26}\,\text{nt}}{9.11\times 10 ^{-31}\,\text{kilogram}} \\
      &= 8.78\times 10^{4}\,\text{m/s}^2
\end{align*}

3. We know that

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta v/\Delta t = a
\end{equation*}

Therefore

\begin{align*}
    \Delta v &= a(\Delta t)  \\
             &= 8.78\times 10 ^e4\,\text{m/s}^2\,\times 10^{-7}\,\text{s} \\
             &= 8.78\times 10^{-3}\,\text{m/s}
\end{align*}

There are experimental reasons for believing that this is of the right order of magnitude for the average speed of electrons in a wire.

## Electromotive Force
\label{sec:40.2}

We can extend the analogy of balls falling through glycerin to a simple electric circuit.


In Figure \ref{fig:40.6}.A we see balls rolling and falling under the action of the earth&#39;s gravitational field, <var>g</var>.
If the balls are to keep moving at a constant rate, work has to be done against gravitational force as each ball is lifted from D to A.
The energy is supplied by the man, who acquires it by the complicated chemical process that transforms food energy into mechanical energy.
Notice that there is a small difference in gravitational potential, $g(\Delta h_1)$, between points A and B, a large differ ence, $g(\Delta h_2)$, between points B and C, and a small difference again, $g(\Delta h_3)$, between points C and D.
In this arrangement a &ldquo;potential-difference meter&rdquo; (analogous to a voltmeter) could consist of an ordinary meter stick.


<figure>
\label{fig:40.6}
\caption{Analogy between the effect of the earth&#39;s gravitational field and that of an electric field.}
</figure>

<figure>
\label{fig:40.7}
\caption{How an ammeter will read when connected in different parts of a circuit.}
</figure>

The frictional force on each ball as it falls in the glycerin from B to C is equal to its weight.
This makes the resultant force zero, which is what is required for descent at a constant speed.
The frictional force on each ball in AB and CD is much smaller than its weight.
This is suggested by the small slope of the inclined planes in these regions.
The man has to do work $mgh (h=\Delta h_1 + \Delta h_2 + \Delta h_3)$ on each ball to move it from D back to A so that it can start the cycle again.

In Figure \ref{fig:40.6}.B we have the electrical counterpart of Figure \ref{fig:40.6}.A, a complete electric circuit, $ABCD$.
Electric charges are moving under the influence of the electric field, <var>E</var>.
The potential difference between points A and B is very small because the charges encounter only a slight resistance to their motion in this region.
The potential difference between points B and C is great because the resistance there is great; the letter R signifies, in fact, that this portion of the circuit, like the lamp in Figure \ref{fig:40.2}, is a resistor (a conductor with relatively large resistance).
There is only a small potential difference between C and D.
The charges have a low potential at D, and it takes energy, which is supplied by the battery, to lift them to a high potential at A.
The battery transforms chemical into electrical energy by a complicated process, which I shall not analyze any more than I analyzed the internal workings of the man of Figure \ref{fig:40.6}.A.

The ability of the battery to raise positive charges from a low potential at D to a high potential at A is measured by the number of joules per coulomb, $\Delta W/\Delta q$, it needs in order to do this.
(It is actually electrons, with negative charges, that are moving&emdash;and the other way round; but this poses only semantic problems.
We could talk the whole thing out by using different words, but we are here adhering to the classical idea that current consists of positive charges whose potential is <em>raised</em> in going from D to A.)
The ratic $\Delta W/\Delta q$ is called the electromotive force (abbreviated as emf) of the battery and is symbolizec as $\Epsilon$.
It is the work per unit charge done by the battery in moving positive charges against the electric field within the battery.
It is not, ot course, a force in the Newtonian sense; it is measured in joules per coulomb, or volts, not ir newtons; but the word &ldquo;force&rdquo; has become firmh established in the vocabulary of electricity.
Since $\Delta W/\Delta q$ is measured in volts, you might ask why we do not simply say that $\Epsilon$ is the difference in potential between points D and A.
The answer is that the battery itself may have internal resistance, and that the potential difference betweer points D and A may therefore be somewhat less than $\Epsilons$, depending on how much internal resistance there is.
Ideally, with no internal resist ance, $\Epsilon$, measured in volts, would be equal t( the difference in potential between points D and A

Let us return, for illustration, to Figure \ref{fig:40.3}.
The voltmeter showed (B) a potential different of 5.45~volts between D and A when there was electric current in the circuit.
This was not, however, the emf of the battery.
The potential differ ence across the terminals of a battery is never exactly equal to its emf when there is curren through the battery.
When the switch is open (A) the potential difference is almost 6 volts.
We hav to hedge here because some charges flow ever when the voltmeter alone is connected across the battery; the potential difference is not quite equal to the emf unless the resistance of the voltmeter is infinite&emdash;that is, unless the voltmeter draws no current.
A good voltmeter, obviously, has a very high resistance.


I have been using the term &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; in a qualitative way.
In order to define it precisely, I have to measure current.
Notice that the argument so far has not depended upon current.
I have talked only of potential difference (&ldquo;voltage&rdquo; in the vernacular of the electrician).
But perhaps our rolling-ball analogy (Fig. \ref{fig:40.6}) has shown why the reading of the voltmeter in Figure \ref{fig:40.3}.
F was zero.
(It corresponded to a vanishingly small $\Delta h_1$.)
The potential rise ($\Epsilon = \Delta W/\Delta q$) within the battery&emdash;that is, the emf&emdash;must equal the sum of the potential drops (<var>&Delta;V</var>) in the complete circuit or loop.
We let $V_{AB}$ mean &ldquo;the potential difference between points A and B.&rdquo;
Since $V_{AD}$ and $V_{CD}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:40.6}.B) are both practically zero, the voltmeter readings of Figure 40.3.B,D are practically identical.
We now imagine (Fig. \ref{fig:40.6}) connecting one terminal of the voltmeter to point A.
We then touch points B, C, and D with a wire connected to the other terminal of the voltmeter.
We read that $V_{AB}=0$, that $V_{AC}=5.45\,\text{volt}$, and that $V_{AD}=5.45\,\text{volt}$.
The reason for this is that
\begin{align*}
    V_{AD} &= V_{AB} + V_{BC} + V_{CD} \\
           &= 0 + 5.45 V + = 5.45 V
\end{align*}

Before we can proceed, we need to define resistance in terms of potential difference and current.

## Ohm&#39;s Law
\label{fig:40.3}

We shall now use the ammeter in the circuit of Figure 40.3.
To use an ammeter, you must break into the circuit at some point and allow the current to pass through the ammeter.
\footnote{
    Two interesting exceptions to this statement are: (1) a special alternating-current ammeter that just clamps its coil round the current-carrying wire; (2) a special directcurrent meter, used by automobile electricians, that works essentially like Oersted&#39;s experiment; it is simply clipped onto the battery-charging line.
}

Figure 40.7 shows that the ammeter reads 2.73~amperes in each of four different positions.
This simply means that charges are conserved.
The number of charges flowing per second past any point in the circuit must be the same as the number flowing per second past any other point; otherwise charges would be either accumulating or leaking away.

<figure>
\label{fig:40.8}
\caption{The sum of inward currents at a junction is equal to the sum of outward currents. }
</figure>

<figure>
\label{fig:40.9}
\caption{One way to connect an ammeter and a voltmeter to measure the resistance of a resistor. }
</figure>

If, for example (Fig. 40.8), we have a junction, <var>O</var>, where the currents are <var>I_1</var> <var>I_2</var>, <var>I_3</var> and <var>I_4</var>, it must be true that $\sum I=0$&emdash;that is, that $I_1+I_2+I_3+I_4=0$— if we consider &ldquo;coming into <var>O</var>&rdquo; as positive and &ldquo;leaving <var>O</var>&rdquo; as negative.

So far Figure \ref{fig:40.7} simply confirms the fact that the current in a single loop is the same everywhere, including the battery.
Outside the battery, positive charges tend to flow from regions of high to regions of low potential; inside the battery, the energy supplied by the battery makes it possible for positive charges to flow against the electric field that is naturally there (compare <var>DA</var> in the rolling-ball analogy, Figure \ref{fig:40.6}.A).

We now need an experimental fact about metallic conductors.
If such a conductor (labeled BC) is connected as in Figure \ref{fig:40.9}, the ammeter will show the current in it, and the voltmeter will show the voltage across it.
If different currents, <var>I</var>, are made to flow through it, different voltages, <var>V</var>, will appear across it.
A plot of <var>V</var> agaiust <var>I</var> is a straight line going through the origin (Fig. \ref{fig:40.10}); that is, the ratio of <var>V</var> to <var>I</var> is constant.
(This is not true of all kinds of conductors; it is not true, for example, of vacuum tubes or of certain types of crystals.)
I shall now define, by the following equation, the quantity called the resistance, <var>R</var>, of the conductor <var>BC</var>:
\begin{equation}
    \ref{eq:40.3}
    R=\frac{V}{I}
\end{equation}

For some materials (for many different kinds of metallic wires, for example) and under certain conditions (at constant temperature, for example) the resistance defined in this way is a constant, independent of <var>I</var>.
For other kinds of conductors (vacuum tubes, for example) the <var>R</var> defined in this way is not independent of <var>I</var>.
In all cases the resistance defined by equation \ref{eq:40.3} is measured in ohms.
Obviously, &ldquo;volts divided by amperes&rdquo; is equivalent to ohms.
Equation \ref{eq:40.3} is known as Ohm&#39;s law after Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist (1787-1854).

If the current is <var>I</var> and the cross-sectional area

\caption{The voltage drop between <var>V_v</var> and <var>P</var>: is sc small that the bird feels no shock.}
</figure>

of the wire is <var>A</var>, the current density, <var>j</var>, has the magnitude
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.4}
    J =  \frac{I}{A}
\end{equation}


and is measured in amperes per square meter.
For the class of conductors I have been talking about (called ohmic conductors) it is an experimental fact that the electric field intensity, $\mathbf{E}$ established inside the wire (Fig. 40.1 1) is prop tional to the current density in the wire.
In other words, experiments show that

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.5}
    \mathbf{E}\propto\mathbf{j}
\end{equation}
(I have written $\mathbf{j}$ as a vector because $\mathbf{E}$ is a vector.)
There must be a constant of proportionality, $\rho$,  such that

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.6}
    E = \rho \mathbf{j}
\end{equation}

Remembering that $\mathbf{E}$ is measured in volts per meter (equation 40.2), let us find the potential difference, <var>V</var>, across a length, <var>l</var>, of wire as follows.
Dropping the vector notation, we have
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.7}
    El = \rho j l
\end{equation}

Using equation \ref{eq:40.4}, we get
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.7}
    El = \rho \frac{I}{A} l
\end{equation}

But, according to equation \ref{eq:40.2}, $El = V$.
Therefore
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.7}
    V = \rho \frac{I}{A} l
\end{equation}

<figure>
\label{fig:40.13}
\caption{The voltage drop between <var>Q_1</var> and <var>Q_2</var> might be great enough to kill the bird.}
</figure>

or

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.10}
    \frac{V}{I} = \frac{\rho l}{A}
\end{equation}


But this is the ratio that defines resistance, <var>R</var> (equation 40.3).
Hence
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.7}
    R = \\frac{\rho l}{A}
\end{equation}


That is, the resistance of a wire is directly proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area.
[I could have introduced $\rho$ by means of equation 40.11, but I wanted to emphasize, once again (equation \ref{eq:40.6}), the existence of an electric field within a wire carrying a current.]
The constant of proportionality, $\rho$, is called the resistivity of the material.
Resistivity is the inverse of conductivity.
Table 37.2 lists the resistivities of some common substances.


<span class="textsc">EXAMPLE 40.2</span>.
We wish to find the resistance of a piece of copper wire 1~km long and 1~mm in diameter.
We know that
\begin{align*}
 \rho &= 0.172\times 10^{-7}{\ohm\meter} \\
    l &= 10^{3}\,\text{m} \\
    d &= 10^{-3}\,\text{m}
\end{align*}

Therefore
\begin{equation*}
    A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} = 7.85\times 10^{-7}\,\text{m}^2
\end{equation*}

and (equation 40.11)
\begin{align*}
    R &= \frac{0.172\times 10^{-7}\,\text{\Omega{}m}\times 10^{3}\,\text{m}}{7.85\times 10^{-7}\,\text{m}^2} \\
      &= 21.9\,\text{\Omega}
\end{align*}


(The filament of an ordinary 100~watt light bulb has a resistance of about $100\,\text{\Omage}$.)

We can now consider the voltage drop in wires carrying current.
You have seen birds perched on such wires without being killed and apparently without feeling any shock.
Now, one of the harmful things in electric shock, to birds or to people, is the current through the body.
This current obeys, approximately, Ohm&#39;s law, which implies that we get big currents through the body if we touch points with large potential differences.

There is a voltage drop, $V = IR$ (see equation \ref{eq:40.3}), in a wire, but the potential difference (Fig. \ref{fig:40.12}) between points <var>P_1</var> and <var>P_2</var>, where the bird&#39;s feet rest on the wire, is exceedingly small.
In Example 40.2 we saw that the resistance of 1,000~m of a certain copper wire was $21.9\,\text{\Omega}$.
The resistance of 10~cm would be only $21.9\times 10^{-4}\,\text{\Omega}$.
Even if the wire carried a current of 100~amperes (very unlikely), the potential drop from <var>P_1</var> to <var>P_2</var> would be only 0.219~volts.
Such a small potential difference could not send enough current through the bird to do much harm.

A great potential drop might occur (Fig. 40.13) across some distant load&emdash;a motor, <var>M</var>, perhaps.
Hence the potential difference between points <var>Q_1</var> and <var>Q_2</var> on wires carrying the same current might be very great indeed.
If the bird could put one foot at <var>Q_1</var> and the other at <var>Q_2</var>, it might be killed. 
We can now consider our original circuit symbolically.
In Figure \ref{fig:40.14} the battery, <var>B</var>, with its internal resistance, <var>r</var>, is enclosed in a dashed line; the lamp, <var>L</var>, has resistance <var>R</var>.
The current, <var>I</var>, is the same in both <var>B</var> and <var>L</var>.
The potential drop in <var>L</var> is <var>IR</var> (equation \ref{eq:40.3}); the potential drop in <var>B</var> is <var>Ir</var>.
The charges leave point <var>P</var> at the same potential at which they arrive there.
The work per unit charge done by the battery, $\Epsilon = \Delta W/\Delta q$, must therefore exactly equal the drop in potential, $IR + Ir$.
Hence
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.12}
    \Epsilon - IR = IR
\end{equation}

Now Figure \ref{fig:40.3} indicates (D) that $IR=5.45\,\text{volts}$ and (B) that $\Epsilon - Ir = 5.45\,\text{volts}$.
From Figure \ref{fig:40.7} we see that $I=2.73\,\text{amperes}$.
Therefore
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.13}
    R = \frac{5.45\,\text{volt}}{2.73\,\text{ampere}} = 2\,\text{\Omega}
\end{equation}

From Figure \ref{fig:40.3}.A we know that $\Epsilon$ is almost 6 volts.
Therefore, using the equation

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.14}
    \Epsilon - Ir = 5.45\,\text{volts}
\end{equation}

we get

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:40.15}
    Ir &= \left(6-5.45\right)\,\text{volt} \\
       &= 0.55\,\text{volt}
\end{align}

But $I=2.73\,\text{ampere}$. Therefore

\begin{align*}
    r &= \frac{0.55\,\text{volt}}{2.73\,\text{ampere}} \\
      &= 0.2\,\text{\Omega}
\end{align*}

We have now accounted for the voltage readings of Figure \ref{fig:40.3}, and we have learned something about electric circuits in the process.

## How the Ammeter and the Voltmeter Work

I have already told how a galvanometer works; it is a coil, mounted between the poles of a magnet, whose dipole moment experiences a torque when it carries current (§ 38.4).
If (Fig. \ref{fig:40}. \ref{fig:15}.A,C) a low-resistance conductor, <var>S</var> (called a shunt), is connected across the coil, <var>C</var>, in parallel with it, most of the current flows through <var>S</var>, and we have an ammeter.
The combination, which has a low resistance, can be designed to measure even a large current, for very little of the current flows through the coil.

<figure>
\label{fig:40.14}

    Our original series circuit treated symbolically.
    The internal resistance of the battery is shown as <var>r</var>.
    If $\Epsilon$ is the emf of the battery, $\Epsilon - Ir = IR$.
}
</figure>


The same galvanometer can be converted into a voltmeter (Fig. \ref{fig:40.15}.B,D).
If the coil, <var>C</var>, is connected in series with a resistor, <var>M</var>, of high resistance (called a multiplier), even a large potential difference, <var>V</var>, across the terminals <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> will produce only a small current through the coil, <var>C</var>, since $I=\frac{V}{R}$ and <var>R</var> here includes the resistance of both <var>M</var> and <var>C</var>.
The whole device has, as a good voltmeter must have, a high resistance.
The details may be clarified by reference to Problems 40.15, 40.16, and 40.17.

It is also left for Problem 40.14 to prove that, when two resistors are connected in series, the resistance of the combination is simply the sum of the two resistances, but that, when they are connected in parallel, the reciprocal of the combination is the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistors.
For resistors in series (as in Fig. \ref{fig:40.15}.B.D)

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.16}
    R = R_1 + R_2
\end{equation}

For resistors in parallel (as in Fig. \ref{fig:40.15}.A, C)

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.17}
    \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}
\end{equation}


## Electric Power Dissipated as Heat
\label{sec:40.5}

The analogy of balls falling through glycerin (Fig. \ref{fig:40.6}.A) is useful, for we see immediately that the loss in potential energy must appear as heat.
Similarly, the loss in potential energy of charges moving in the resistor, <var>R</var>, of Figure \ref{fig:40.6}.B can appear in the form of heat.
The work required to lift a bail in Figure \ref{fig:40.6}.A is $W=mgh$. 
The work per unit mass is $\frac{W}{m} = gh$.
Similarly, the work required to move the positive charge <var>&Delta;q</var> from <var>B</var> to <var>A</var> is

\begin{align*}
    \Delta W &= \left(\Delta q\right) V_{BA} = \text{coulombs}\times\text{volts} \\
             &= \text{coulombs}\times\frac{\text{joules}}{\text{coulomb}} = \text{joules}
\end{align*}

The rate of doing work, <var>P</var> (for power), is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.18}
    P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t} V_{BA}
\end{equation}

But $\frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$ is the current, <var>I</var>, in amperes.
Hence $P=IV_{BA}$ This must be in joules per second, or watts.
If all this power goes into heating the resistor, we may write

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.19}
    P_J = IV
\end{equation}

The subscript J is for &ldquo;joule,&rdquo; to remind us that heat is being generated.
Thus &ldquo;amperes times volts&rdquo; is equivalent to &ldquo;watts.&rdquo;
Since 4.184 joules = 1 calorie, we may use the expression $\frac{IV}{4.184}$ to compute the calories per second generated in a resistor.

From Ohm&#39;s law (equation 40.3) we know that $V=IR$; so we may write

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.20}
    P_j = i\left(IR\right) = I^2 R
\end{equation}

Since, if several resistors are connected in series,
they all carry the same /, this form of the equation
(Pj = PR) is useful.

On the other hand, since $I=\frac{V}{R}$, we may write

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:40.20}
    P_j = i\left(IR\right) = I^2 R
\end{equation}


<figure>
\label{fig:40.15}
\caption{
    Symbolic representation of the components (A, C) of an ammeter and (B, D) of a voltmeter.

</figure>

Since, if several resistors are connected in parallel, each has the same potential drop as the others, this form ($P_J = I^2 R$) is applicable to such combinations.

## Summary
\label{sec:40.6}

A battery has the ability to raise positive charges from a low potential to a high potential.
Positive charges in an external electric circuit connected to this battery tend to flow from the region of high potential to that of low potential.
This flow is called current. Actually, in wires, negative charges (electrons) flow in the opposite direction, but the logic is not affected.

The work per unit charge done by the battery is called its electromotive force, $\Epsilon$; it is the ratio $\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta q}$, measured in joules per coulomb, or volts.


The potential rise in the battery must equal the sum of all the potential drops, <var>&Delta;V</var>, in the whole circuit.
The potential drop across an ohmic resistor of resistance R in which there is current <var>I</var> is $V-IR$ (Ohm&#39;s law).
The resistance of a wire is directly proportional to the product of its length and its resistivity and is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area.

The flow of charges in a wire is very similar to the flow of a liquid in a pipe.
When several wires meet at a point, for example, the sum of the inward currents is equal to the sum of the outward currents.

In both pipes and wires energy can be dissipated in the form of heat.
If the potential drop in a wire is <var>V</var>, the work it takes to move charge <var>q</var> across it is <var>qV</var>, and the rate of doing work, or power, is $P=IV$.
The power that goes into heating a resistor may be written as $I^2 R$ or as $\frac{V^2}{R}$.
