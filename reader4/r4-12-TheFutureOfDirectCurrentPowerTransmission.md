title: The Future of Direct Current Power Transmission
author: N. L Allen
excerpt: Since the Niagara power plant was built, commercial electric power has been almost entirely alternating current.
    Now new consideration is being given to the advantages of direct current for long distance power transmission.
intro: A popular article published in 1967.

For underground or submarine cables, where dielectric losses and charging currents are so important, the `critical length&#39; is reduced to about 30 miles, and it is in short submarine links and in urban transmission lines that direct current finds its second important application.
Indeed, where large amounts of power have to be introduced into large cities, legal and social considerations may predominate over technical and economic factors.
It is frequently extremely difficult to obtain permission to erect overhead lines in urban areas, and the disturbance to local amenities caused by the towers for hightension cables may not be justifiable.
Underground cables become necessary, and it is preferable to use direct current for distances greater than about 30 miles.


In choosing between the systems, the fact that there can be no direct current transformer and that there is no satisfactory circuit breaker ensures that alternating current maintains its general superiority for distribution purposes.
The use of direct current is thus confined to the bulk transmission of high power between discrete parts of a system or between two separate systems.
