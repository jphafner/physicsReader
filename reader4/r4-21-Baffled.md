<span class="textsc">YOU</span> learn something new every day.
With no thought of selfimprovement, for example, I was reading that story of Thurber&#39;s in which he recalls his mother&#39;s belief that electricity leaks out of an empty light socket if the switch has been left on.
From this I gathered&emdash;going by the general context, and the known fact that Thurber was a humorist&emdash;that it doesn&#39;t.


I picked up another piece of electrical knowledge in 1951, while working as a drama critic on the Yorkshire Evening Post.
Wanting to imply that a certain actress had given a muted performance, I wrote that while undoubtedly she had an electric presence, on this occasion it was as if the electricity had been immersed in water.
A kindly sub-editor explained to me that when electricity gets wet, by some miracle of the elements it intensifies rather than diminishes.
I have never seen the sense of this, but I conceded the point and have used only gas-driven metaphor since that date.


I was never taught electricity at school, nor was it often a topic of dinner-table conversation among my parents.
What I know about the subject I have mastered the hard way.
Take, as an instance, television, an electrical device of awesome complexity.
Unlike more privileged students, who are able to go running to m&#39;tutor every time the framehold goes wobbly, I have had to learn in the School of Life that on the large rented model the knobs are on the front whereas on the HMV portable they are on the side. Similarly with electric irons.
When I bought my first electric iron there was no plug attached, presumably in case I wanted to wind the flex around my neck and jump off Westminster Bridge with it.
There was a leaflet explaining how to get the plug on, but this was of course in German, the international language of the household appliances industry.
Only by putting my natural intelligence to the problem did I eventually work out the solution&emdash;find a German-speaking electrician.

And so, what with having perforce to change a light bulb here and tune in a transistor radio there, I have picked up a pretty sound working knowledge of electrical matters.
It is not comprehensive, God knows&emdash;I still can&#39;t fully understand why you can&#39;t boil an egg on an electric guitar&emdash;but when I jot down a summary of what I have learned, I marvel that I have never been asked to write for the Electrical Journal:

1. Most electricity is manufactured in power stations where it is fed into wires which are then wound around large drums.

2. Some electricity, however, does not need to go along wires.
That used in portable radios, for example, and that used in lightning.
This kind of electricity is not generated but is just lying about in the air, loose.

3. Electricity becomes intensified when wet.
Electric kettles are immune to this.

4. Electricity has to be earthed.
That is to say, it has to be connected with the ground before it can function, except in the case of aeroplanes, which have separate arrangements.

5. Electricity makes a low humming noise.
This noise may be pitched at different levels for use in doorbells, telephones, electric organs, etc.

6. Although electricity does not leak out of an empty light socket, that light socket is nevertheless live if you happen to shove your finger in it when the switch is at the &ldquo;on&rdquo; position.
So if it is not leaking, what else is it doing?

7. Electricity is made up of two ingredients, negative and positive.
One ingredient travels along a wire covered with red plastic, and the other along a wire covered with black plastic.
When these two wires meet together in what we call a plug, the different ingredients are mixed together to form electricity.
Washing machines need stronger electricity, and for this a booster ingredient is required.
This travels along a wire covered with green plastic.

8. Stronger electricity cannot be used for electric razors.
Electric razors make a fizzing sound when attached to a power plug.

9. Electricity may be stored in batteries.
Big batteries do not necessarily hold more electricity than small batteries.
In big batteries the electricity is just shovelled in, while in small batteries (transistors) it is packed flat.

10. Electricity is composed of small particles called electrons, an electron weighing only 1 1 837 as much as an atom of the lightest chemical element, hydrogen, unless the <em>Encyclopedia Britannica</em> is a liar.


Incurious people are content to take all this as read.
They press a switch and the light comes on, and that is all they know about the miracle in their homes.
This has never done for me.
I have to know how things work, and if I cannot find out from some technical handbook&emdash;the Every Boys&#39; Wonder Book series does an advanced manual on electricity&emdash;then I combine such information as I already have with simple logic.
Thus it is very easy to deduce that the light switch controls a small clamp or vice which grips the wires very hard, so that the electricity cannot get through.
When the switch is flicked on the vice is relaxed and the electricity travels to the light bulb where a bit of wire, called the element, is left bare.
Here, for the first time, we can actually see the electricity, in the form of a small spark.
This spark is enlarged many hundreds of times by the curved bulb which is made of magnifying glass.


Why, is our next question, do these light bulbs have a limited life?
As any schoolboy knows, heat converts oxygen into moisture.
When all the oxygen in the light bulb has become liquified in this manner, it naturally quenches the electric spark.
Some years ago a man in Birmingham invented an everlasting electric light bulb which, since it contained no oxygen, would never go out.
The rights in it were bought up by the Atlas people who keep it locked in their safe.


Now we come to electricity as a source of power rather than a source of light or heat.
Why, when you plug in an electric iron, docs it get hot, whereas when you plug in an electric fan it does not get hot but whirrs round and round?
The answer is that when light or heat is required we use bare electricity, whereas when power is required we keep the electricity covered up.
The constant flow of sparks, unable to escape, is converted into energy.
This energy is fed into a motor which makes things go round and round.


I have not yet touched on fuse wire.
It has always amazed me that an industry which is so en/terprising in most respects&emdash;the invention of colour electricity for use in traffic lights and the harnessing of negative electricity for refrigeration are two examples that come to mind&emdash;should still, two hundred years after James Watt invented the electric kettle, be manufacturing fuse wire too thin.
I pass on a hint for what it is worth.
There is available from hardware shops a sturdy wire used mostly for making chicken runs, and this is far more durable than the stufi sold by electricians (who must, I appreciate, make a living).
By using chicken wire I now have a fuse box which&emdash;even when the spin-dryer burst into flames due to too much booster electricity having been fed into it&emdash;has for six months been as impregnable as the Bank of England.

But why have fuse wire at all?
I completely understand that the fuse box is the junction at which the wires leading from the power station join, or fuse with, the wires belonging to the house, and that these two sets of wires have got to be connected with each other somehow.
But what is wrong with a simple knot?
Perhaps I might make this the subject of a paper for the Electrical Journal which, I now see from the Writers&#39; and Artists Year Book, welcomes electro-technical contributions not exceeding 3,000 words.

In some respects, I reiterate, my knowledge is imperfect.
I have not yet explored the field of neon signs&emdash;how do they make the electricity move about?
And the pop-up toaster&emdash;how does it know when the toast is ready? With an electronic eye, presumably&emdash;and this brings us to another fruitful area.
What is the difference between electricity and electronics?
Or is there a difference?
Is electronics now just the smart word to use, like high-speed gas?
How can an English computer speak French, which requires a different voltage?
Logic would answer these questions too, and many of a more technical nature, but the light over my desk has just gone out.
A valve blown somewhere, I expect.
