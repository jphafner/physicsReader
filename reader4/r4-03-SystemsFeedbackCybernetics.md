<span class="textsc">The reader</span> will recall that following the quotation from Teilhard de Chardin in Chapter 1, we proposed extending the scope of our interests to include analysis of relationship and interrelationship of natural phenomena to each other.
We have come to a point that requires a more formal development of such interrelationships.

## Extension of &ldquo;systems&rdquo;
\label{sec:6.1}

One of the accomplishments of the Newtonian period was the strengthening of the concept that in material or physical situations at least, things do not happen without a causing force.
A stone does not hegin to move or come to a stop of its own volition.
In this chapter we shall utilize that concept, but with three extensions.


The first extension takes into account the fact that in most situations surrounding an event (such as the hurling of a stone), the immediate event is itself part of a larger situation or system that includes various other articulating parts or related events.
(That is, there is a person who throws the stone, and the throwing has relation to some cause or purpose.)


The second extension may perhaps be thought of as related to the actionreaction principle, namely, that within the context of the system involving an event (a stone is thrown) there is often a feedback effect (for example, the one at whom the stone is thrown may hurl it back).


The third extension includes in the system both material things (stones) and human beings along with biological processes and the less tangible thought processes.


What do we mean by the term system?
We might refer to the weight suspended from a spring as a system that executes simple harmonic motion.
The governor that controls the speed of an engine is a control system.
We also speak of a system of highways, the economic system of a nation, a system of thought, and of many others.
The combination locks that protect the vault of a savings bank make up a protective system, but this can also be said to be only a subsystem of the banking institution.
The banking institution is itself only a subsystem within the larger community economics, and the latter is a subsystem of national economics.
The chain of larger and larger subsystems, or the nesting of subsystems within larger subsystems, may lead to very complex assemblies and relationships.


While an accurate, all-encompassing definition for the term is not easy to give, we can note a few of the characteristics that are usually present in what we call a system:


(1) A system is likely to have two or more parts, elements, or aspects, which tend to have some functional relation to each other (like the bolt and key of the lock, or the president and staff of the bank).


(2) Because systems are usually subsystems of larger units it is usually helpful (and often necessary) to confine one&#39;s study to the smallest unit that encompasses the particular functional elements and interrelationships that are under study.
(For example, the locksmith can quite properly repair a fault in the lock system of the bank vaults without considering the question of the merits of socialism for the nation&#39;s banking system.)


(3) A control system has within itself regulatory functions for control of variables such as speed of a motor, the temperature of a room, the price of commodities, or international trade in narcotics.


(4) It is usually possible to identify an &ldquo;input&rdquo; and an &ldquo;output&rdquo; portion (or aspect) of a system.
For example, a key placed in a lock and turned (input) will cause the bolts to move (output); or an order from a president of an industrial firm (input) can double the selling price of its commercial products (output).
We shall find, however, that most systems have more than one form of input, as well as a variety of functional relationships that produce quite varied output.


(5) Usually (nearly always in systems that include regulatory functions) there is some form of feedback from the output to the input, which may greatly modify the net output of the system.
[For example, when the selling prices of the commercial products of paragraph (4) were doubled, the consumers could have initiated strong feedback by refusing to buy the products; and the industry&#39;s board of directors could have exerted even stronger feedback by firing the president and hiring another who would hold the prices at a more acceptable level.]
The role of feedback will be given considerable attention in the discussion that follows.


We shall now turn to a more detailed introduction to systems, feedback, and control.


## Cyclic character of natural phenomena
\label{sec:6.2}


In Chapter 5 we learned that a mass suspended from a spring executes simple harmonic motion when displaced slightly from its equilibrum position.
When the motion was recorded on a moving sheet of paper (to illustrate the motion as a function of time), the oscillations were recorded as sine or cosine waveforms.
It was shown that the motion was initiated when potential energy was added to the system of weight and spring (by manually raising the weight from its rest position, against the pull of gravity, or by pulling it down and extending the spring).
In either case, the pull of gravity or the pull of the spring alternately introduced a restoring force, which tended to return the displaced mass to its original position (Fig. 5.24).
But since force applied to mass accelerates the mass and thereby increases its velocity (Eq. 5-1), by the time the mass reached the &ldquo;zero&rdquo; or initial position it had acquired so much velocity (because the potential energy we added manually had become kinetic energy at that point) that the mass moved past the zero point to the other extreme.
There would have been few or no oscillations at all, on the other hand, if the weight had been subjected to so much frictional drag that the added (potential) energy was lost as heat.f (This might have been the case if the weight moved in a viscous liquid.)


What about cyclic behavior in other phenomena of nature?
A very common form can be demonstrated in electric circuits in which the electric energy rapidly passes back and forth between parts of an oscillating circuit until the electric energy dissipates as heat or radiates away from the circuit (as in the transmission of radio waves).

We shall find that there can be many forms of oscillatory behavior when a &ldquo;disturbance&rdquo; changes the energy level of a system and introduces a restoring force that causes the energy to convert to another form rather than completely dissipate into the heat energy of the environment.
The term energy may apply not only to mechanical, electrical, or chemical characters in physical systems, but also to institutional and personal pressures in social situations.

\footnote{
    We shall learn in Chapter 10 that the kinetic energy of the system goes into faster, random motion of the molecules that make up the parts of the system.
    The increased molecular motion raises the temperature of the parts of the system, as though it were heated by a flame.
    There is therefore a correspondence or equivalence between the energy in a flame and mechanical motion of the system.
}


Let us now go to other phenomena that show cyclic or periodic variation.
(See Figs. 6.1(a) through 6.1(d), for graphical examples of such cyclic variations.)
We might utilize various sensing devices to record changes in the temperature of an air-conditioned room as a function of time, the height of the tides of the sea, wind velocity, the automobile traffic on a road, rainfall, the movements of a tall building or of the long span of a bridge, or the temperature of the earth.
We might also look up past statistics on wheat production, the stock market, attendance at church, tourist travel, populations of animals, or the length of women&#39;s skirts, and plot these in graph form as function of time.
We would find that many phe- nomena in nature and in animal or social activity have variations of an oscillating character (Fig. 6.1).
It can be demonstrated that in all these situations which show oscillations about some average point, there is present a restoring force that comes into play whenever there is energy change in a system.
To be sure, the magnitude and shapes of these oscillations and waves vary considerably from the sine waves we observe with a weight on a spring.
The periods may vary from 10&endash;15 sec in the case of light waves, to several hours for the period of the tides, and to many years in the case of other cycles of nature and of some social customs.
Nevertheless, all are subject to some common influence, not the least of which is the fact that nature is dynamic and in a state of continuous change, and indeed that static situations represent special and almost trivial aspects of nature and of man.

Is the presence of some restoring force sufficient assurance that a system will experience only moderate oscillations without going to extremes?
Indeed it is not, as we can learn from the dramatic example of the failure of the Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge of Tacoma, Washington.
When the bridge was opened to traffic on July 1, 1940, there were observed, in addition to the ordinary oscillations of the bridge, some unexpected transverse (vertical) modes of vibration. 
On November 7 a wind velocity of 40 to 45 mph made the vibrations so severe that the bridge was closed to traffic, and by 11:00 A.M. the main span collapsed.
\footnote{
    A 4-minute film produced by the Ohio State University and distributed by The Ealing Corporation of Cambridge, Massachusetts, gives the very dramatic story of the final oscillation of the bridge prior to its collapse.
    Everv reader should see this film and the variation it offers of &ldquo;simple harmonic motion&rdquo; involving the twisting and turning of this huge span of steel and concrete.
    The new bridge that was built on the original anchorages and tower foundations included deep stiffening trusses instead of girders, and has been entirely successful.

    At the right, the hand is moved upward when the mass is also moving upward, causing the mass to take large swings.
}
</figure>

## How oscillations increase despite restoring forces
\label{sec:6.3}

It is not necessary to resort to the complex behavior of the original Tacoma Narrows bridge to see how a system may have within it strong restoring forces while yet experiencing oscillations that increase in amplitude to the point of destruction.
The reader can duplicate the phenomenon with the simple weight on a spring as follows (Fig. 6.2):


Choose a weight and spring combination that gives an oscillatory period between $\frac{1}{5}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ sec.
Hold the spring firmly and steady in your hand, and observe that the weight executes the usual simple harmonic motion, eventually coming to a stop.
Now prepare to move your holding hand up or down in synchronism with the motion of the weight and with two alternative movements.


First, raise your hand (about a half-inch will do) whenever the weight is moving downward, and lower it an equal distance whenever the weight is moving up.
With a little analysis you can see that the weight tends to reduce amplitude because the movements of your hand increase the restoring force on the weight.
Note that the movement of your hand is 180 deg out of phase with the motion of the weight.


Next, repeat the experiment with the same up-and-down motion of your hand, but now change the timing to be in phase with the motion of the weight.
That is, move your hand upward when the weight is moving upward, and downward when the weight is moving downward.
There still is restoring force, and the weight continues to oscillate up and down; but now the amplitude of oscillations increases until it becomes dangerous to continue the experiment.


Why did the same amount of motion of your hand have such opposite effects, depending only on its phase relationship to the motion of the weight?
The reason is that in the second case the increments of energy that were introduced by each in-phase motion of your hand tended to add to and increase the energy of the system represented by the spring and weight.
Conversely, the hand motion that was completely out of phase with the motion of the weight detracted from the energy of the system.
\footnote{
    The reader is urged to perform this experiment and to attempt a careful analysis of the various factors (energies and forces) that become involved in the two cases.
    For example, in the second case the increments of energy are added to the spring-weight system.
    Where does the hand energy go in the first case?
}


We can now extend this experiment to apply to the early Tacoma Narrows bridge experience.
Obviously, the energy of the wind became converted to energy of oscillation of the bridge. Why did the wind energy not become absorbed in the concrete and steel of the bridge?
Undoubtedly much of it did become absorbed and changed to heat energy, but not all of it.
Apparently when the wind blew to produce a movement of the span at some point along the bridge, the conditions were just right to cause this movement to act as a traveling wave, which on backward reflection returned to the same point in just the right phase to support (rather than oppose) a new movement at that point, caused by the continued blowing of the wind.
Had the physical structure of the bridge been different in length or mass, the returning wave could have opposed (out of phase with) any new movement at <span class="math">A</span>, and thus would have added to the stability of the system.


We see, therefore, that for a system to be stable, the relationship of the forces and time characteristics must be such that the amplitude and energy of the system will not increase.
This calls for special attention with respect to the phase relationships that obtain between feedback of energy from one part of the system to another part.
When the feedback opposes the direction of the initial change that produced the feedback, the system tends to be stable.
In contrast, when the returning feedback of energy supports the direction of initial change, the system tends to add to the initial energy gain and to be unstable.
This means we must delve into the theory of system control.

## Modifying cyclic changes: controls
\label{sec:6.4}


While most fluctuations of nature go their own way without inviting human concern, there are some important cases in which it becomes necessary to interfere, that is, to modify the natural pattern or to control or hold the fluctuations to smaller changes.
For example, the farmer may not want to depend entirely on natural rainfall to assure a good crop, so he intervenes by irrigating the fields when there is not enough rainfall.
Because in the course of the year there are wide fluctuations in the temperature of the earth, he installs a control system in his home to keep the temperature within comfortable limits.


Many types of controls are involved in our daily life.
We shall learn that the human body has a remarkable control system to maintain its own temperature within very close limits.
The body&#39;s motor functions, by which we move our arms and legs in an accurate and determined manner, are possible only because of the operation of fine control systems.
Industrial production relies heavily on control of temperature, pressure, chemical composition, and similar factors.
The application of control principles extends to community and national life.
Despite their variety, we shall find that there are some common characteristics among them.
Also, within a specific control system there can be intermixed a wide variety of elements of widely different types.
Take, for example, the very common experience of driving an automobile.
Here, the steering control allows the driver to follow the curvature of the road effectively, and many other electromechanical parts as well in the motor and transmission systems affect the driving operation.
But we shall learn before long that nearly every aspect of the driver&#39;s being&emdash;his metabolism, muscle and nerve action, his thinking process&emdash;and the life of his community are all parts of the system that encompasses the simple driving experience.

## Introduction to on-off control
\label{sec:6.5}

We return to the harmonic motion of the weight suspended from a spring and note that, so far, we have neither tried to restrict the amplitude of the motion nor put the movement to some useful application.
In each assembly the added energy is converted and reconverted from kinetic energy to potential energy and then back again to kinetic energy.
(If there were no frictional losses, the motion would continue forever, since the system would then be self-contained, that is, a closed or isolated system that neither receives energy from nor gives energy to the outside.)
Such systems have limited value except as one may use them in a clock or metronome to tell time from the oscillations.
\footnote{
    Of course, as any such device requires periodic additions ot energy to the driving springs, and therefore the person who winds the spring becomes part of the system.
}

If there were no frictional or other loss of energy from the system, the motion would have a periodicity of <span class="math">T</span> seconds.
Since friction is present, the oscillations become continually smaller in magnitude, and the period of each cycle becomes slightly longer ($T + \Delta T$) until the mechanical energy dissipates as heat energy and the movement ceases altogether (Fig. 6.3).
In general, friction or damping is likely to make a system more stable.

<figure>
\label{fig:6.3}
\caption{
    How the period of simple harmonic motion changes when there is friction in the system.
    (The period of seconds increases to $T + \Delta T$ sec, while the amplitude of motion decreases.)
}
</figure>


We can design an oscillator to do something more by adding an electric switch so that the dropping weight sends an electrical signal to some device.
As we know from common experience, the simple operation of an electric switch can initiate (or trigger) many motor or relay functions that bring into play the vast energy resources of electric powergenerating stations.
Figure 6.4 illustrates the relationship between input and output, with a transform function that relates the two along with a source of energy.


Suppose that we incorporate such an electric switch as part of a control system for automatically filling a bucket with water.
Figure 6.5 illustrates how the dropping pail signals that the pail is full and also turns off the stream of water.
This becomes a simple on-off control system in which the electrical signal provides a feedback function as part of the control system.
(Later we shall introduce the idea that the feedback also represents information.)


We examine this process of filling the bucket in a little more detail.
When the water flows into the bucket at a very slow rate, the bucket settles slowly and the signal switch has time to stop the flow of water and bring the bucket to a gentle stop.
This is shown as curve A of Fig. 6.6, which shows very little dropping of the bucket below the desired level (that is, there is very little overshoot beyond the desired control point).
The behavior becomes quite different when the water flows into the bucket at a rapid rate, however.
The switch operates as it did before, but the rapid dropping of the bucket develops enough momentum to overshoot the desired final position by a substantial amount.
The bucket will oscillate violently above and below the desired control height for some time and the switch will open and close erratically (curve B).
In fact, if the response rates and delays in the switching and valve devices should turn out to be particularly unsuitable, the water would be turned on and off in such erratic manner as to recall the sad fate of the Tacoma Narrows bridge; see curve <span class="math">B</span>, dotted line, Fig. 6.6.


<figure>
\label{fig:6.4}
\caption{
    How a small input change (such as the operation of an electric switch) can bring into play sources of energy and thereby produce an output that may be quite different inform and magnitude from the input.
    Each such conversion can be referred to as involving a transformation (transfer function or transform function).
}
</figure>


In the case of room-temperature control, the thermostat is likely to be kept at one temperature (for comfort), say, around $72^{\circ}$F.

In the case of the baking oven, the temperature setting will vary with the requirements for baking a cake or roasting meat.
In either case, the temperature will vary (or hunt) around the set control point.
The hunting or oscillations can be decreased if the rate of heat input is slow.
But this would increase the time needed to bring the room or oven to the desired temperature.
With on-off control, the heating unit becomes fully hot whenever the control switch turns it on.
By the time the temperature at the thermostat reaches the desired temperature to turn off the heat, the region of the heater units becomes much hotter than necessary, and this excess heat drives the temperature well above the desired temperature.
A similar delay in reactivating the heating unit as the temperature drops below the desired level causes continual hunting above and below the desired temperature.
We shall appreciate more and more, as we examine more cases, that the &ldquo;control&rdquo; of a variable rarely results in an exact holding of the variable to the desired control value.
Nearly always, the variable will hunt or vary about that control value.
Therefore, the function of a successful control system is to hold the variable within acceptable departures from the desired control value.


## Negative versus positive feedback
\label{sec:6.6}


In all the examples given above, while it is clear that control at a point usually ends up as hunting around that point, even this degree of control is achieved only when negative feedback is present. Thus, in the case of the full bucket, the switch turns off the water (since it was the &ldquo;water-on&rdquo; condition that filled the bucket).

<figure>
\label{fig:6.5}
\caption{A simple system for controlling the filling of a bucket.

<figure>
\label{fig:6.6}
\caption{
    How the bucket of Fig. 6.5 behaves: Bucket <span class="math">A</span> is filled slowly and settles gradually to its final level after switch cuts off water flow.
    Bucket <span class="math">B</span> (solid line) is filled rapidly and overshoots final position, rebounds, and hunts for an equilibrium position that is lower than that for bucket <span class="math">A</span> because extra water was added after the first rebound above the switch-off level.
    With a different spring tension for bucket <span class="math">B</span> (dotted line), the hunting may cause addition of sufficient extra water on each cycle so that the amplitude steadily increases until the system collapses.
}
</figure>


In the case of room-temperature control (which we shall discuss presently in detail), the heaters must be turned on when the room temperature is too low, and off when the temperature is too high.

The examples of feedback, as well as the limitations of on-off (sometimes called bang-bang) control can be illustrated further by the example of a blind person walking down a street with his cane.
As he progresses along the sidewalk the tapping of his cane tells him when he is too close to the buildings on the right.
This <em>information</em>, when processed through his brain and muscle system, serves as <em>feedback</em> to change his direction.
Since his movements have taken him too far to the right, now he must move to the left and therefore the <em>feedback must be negative</em>.
If the influence of feedback were positive, it would support or add to the original direction that took him to the right and would take <em>him even farther to the right and directly into the wall</em>.
He now continues to the left until his cane warns that he is too close to the curb at the left.
This information again converts to become negative feedback, which will oppose the move that carried him too far to the left and thereby will restore his direction until a new signal calls for new action.


Our blind person can negotiate the walk fairly well as long as his movements are slow enough to give him time to receive the signal from his tapping, to interpret these, and to translate them into suitable feedback influence.
But now suppose he tries to run down the same sidewalk.
Very soon his rate of receiving and responding to signals would be inadequate, and he would be running in a zigzag or colliding with obstacles.



Such an experience, which the reader can himself check rather dramatically, illustrates several features of control that apply fairly generally, namely:

(1) Stable control requires the presence of negative feedback influences.

(2) Stable control of a variable to a &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; point usually means maintaining the variable so that is does not hunt around the point beyond acceptable limits.

(3) To be effective for the control of any variable, the control system must be designed to have response rates that are suited for the specific application.

These and other characteristics of control systems will be illustrated in the following sections.

## Driving an automobile
\label{sec:6.7}

To illustrate further the limitations of on-off control, let us apply the technique to driving an automobile in a lane of the road that is marked with white lines.
We know from experience that an auto tends to go from side to side (to hunt), and requires continuous steering control.
Let us assume an unreal situation in which we turn the steering wheel a small, fixed amount to make the correction, and do this only when a front wheel touches a white line.
The experiment would then be like the walk of a blind person.
When crawling along at a very slow speed we would find that the car does not go very much outside the lane, but when driving at a moderate speed we would find that this type of correction (applying a fixed amount of adjustment as on-off control) causes the car to weave substantially in and out of the lane.
If we were to drive even faster, the car would be likely to leave the road altogether.
The amount of overshoot would depend on how slowly we respond to visual signals and take action (see Fig. 6.7).

<figure>
\label{fig:6.7}
\caption{Difficulty of driving an auto by on-off control technique.}
</figure>


Fortunately not many people drive in this manner because control of an automobile utilizes a much more sophisticated system of elements than is possible with on-off control.
In fact, not many automatic industrial processes can compare with the sophistication and effectiveness of good auto driving, since human judgment enters this operation to a remarkable degree.
To begin with, as the auto moves to a new position or direction, the driver is kept continually informed of the nature of each new situation through his sense of sight and general physical awareness.
That is, there is continuous feedback, or information, reaching him to guide his next move.
The element of judgment or experience also enters.
He can vary the sharpness of turn of the steering wheel to conform to the sharp right turn.
This is called <em>proportional control</em>.
In addition, he can see a curve in the road ahead long before the auto has reached the curve.
He can therefore anticipate the move (anticipatory control) and thus reduce delay in his action (Fig. 6.8).


The driver of an automobile is aware of several elements that make control more difficult.
If the steering wheel has looseness or &ldquo;play&rdquo; in the shaft or gear system, the steering wheel must be turned several degrees of angle before there is any effect on the front wheel directions.
This play, or region of no response, is sometimes called the <em>dead zone</em> of the system.
The driver himself may be a little slow in judging the situation and taking action.
This &ldquo;lag or slowness of response together with looseness in the steering system, can make for wider overshoot in the movement of the car.
If the throttle sticks, the motor hesitates, or the brakes seize, the driver will not be able to assure smooth &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and ride.
Finally, roughness of the road can introduce random fluctuations that add uncertainty to the normal small feedback of information.
A driver is not likely to give delicate guidance to the auto when his whole body is being shaken.
This background confusion is often called <em>noise</em> or <em>static</em> when one is referring to transmission of signal or of information.
It exists in almost every type of control circuit, sometimes in the form of vibration of an automobile or plant equipment.
It occurs in the normal radioactivity background of the environment, which disturbs radiation measurements.
In very sensitive electronic circuitry it shows up in the random movements of the electrons.
Similar phenomena are present in social situations and in biological organisms that maintain balance in their internal functions and with their environment.


Because cyclic and control aspects of nature are exceedingly important, we must consider control principles and nomenclature in a little more detail before looking at the several types of systems that are common.

## Some control principles&emdash;nomenclature
\label{sec:6.8}


Before beginning detailed discussion we need some convenient terminology and symbols for representing the elements and functions that make up systems.
When the driver of an automobile engages the gears and steps on the accelerator pedal, the motor raeexumd the car moves forward with an expenditure of energy that is vastly greater than the energy applied to the pedal.
The power is amplified. We may represent this by a diagram such as Fig. 6.4.
The input, <span class="math">&Delta;I</span> in this case, appears to be simply the change in position of the pedal and the small energy required to make the change.
The box in Fig. 6.4 represents the change or transformation (ol function) that the input <span class="math">&Delta;I</span> initiates or experiences; in this case the function produces motor power at a level that is related (and perhaps proportional) to the position of the throttle or accelerator pedal.
We can refer to the box as representing a transfer function $f(I)$, or converter, which produces <span class="math">&Delta;O</span>.


What is the source of the energy that makes this conversion possible?
In this case, the energy source is the chemical energy in the tank of gasoline.
The pedal, therefore, is nothing more than a lever device for controlling the use of this chemical energy.
When one includes the tank of gasoline and the driver along with the automobile, the system becomes a <em>closed</em> (or <em>conservative</em>) <em>system</em>.
\footnote{
    We neglect the fact that as gasoline is used up it must be replaced, bringing the entire petroleum industry into our system.
    Likewise, food for the driver is neglected.
}
Without either one, the system would be incomplete.
(It is common practice to omit the sources of energy from block diagrams of control systems and to indicate only the energy input and output for a system.)

The operator has freedom to depress the accelerator pedal quickly or slowly, as he wishes.
A question that is frequently important for analyzing the behavior of control systems is the following: What is the nature of the output response wher the input is given a quick change?
A quick increment of input change, which we may represent by <span class="math">&Delta;I</span>, is usually called an input step function.
\footnote{
    The term step function is often associated with on-off changes because the change of power or direction assumes the form of a sudden change.
    This is illustrated by the shape of the heat input as it is turned on and off in Figs. 6.9 and 6.10.
}
Figure 6.9 illustrates what might happen.
Usually there is some lag in the rise of motor power, as shown by the curved rise and fall of the output.
This lag will not be serious in the case of the automobile, since the input is not likely to be reversed rapidly very often.
In general it is desirable to have as much lag as one can tolerate, consistent with adequate control; otherwise the system will be too ready to &ldquo;jump&rdquo; and probably to overshoot the mark and hunt badly before settling down.
The lower curve of Fig. 6.9 illustrates the nature of the &ldquo;hunting&rdquo; that results when the system is made to respond too quickly to change in input.
How the output will respond depends on the characteristics of the system and on the features incorporated in the transform function box of Fig. 6.4.

<figure>
\label{fig:6.9}
\caption{
    When the input is given a quick change (step function), the response of the output may be designed to be slow or rapid.
    In general, a slow response of output produces less hunting than does rapid response.
}
</figure>


If the system of moving parts includes large, heavy components such as the flywheel and other parts of the automobi le motor, we can appreciate that quicker response is possible only if the motor is designed to have adequate extra power to give the desired acceleration.
But excessive power can make control less smooth and more &ldquo;jumpy,&rdquo; not to mention excessively costly in gasoline and in the complexity of the motor itself.
The goal for design of most systems is to find a happy compromise that makes the system adequately responsive and yet stable against excessive hunting, and which is not too expensive in dollars or in use of energy.


The system we have been discussing has the features of proportional control.
That is, the accelerator pedal may be depressed to give large or small change, and the motor power level will respond with some proportional relationship.
We backtrack a little to discuss on-off control before proceeding further.

## More on on-off control
\label{sec:6.9}

Earlier we discussed how difficult it would be to hold an automobile within the lane of the road if we applied on-off control principles to adjust the steering.
Despite certain limitations, on-off control devices are used very commonly in homes and in industry because of their simplicity.
It is very easy to design an electric iron, an oven, or room-temperature control, to operate an electric switch to turn on (or off) the electric power whenever the temperature falls below (or rises above) set values.
Figure 6.10 illustrates how this might apply to the thermostat controls for heating a room in the winter time.
As shown in Fig. 6.10(a), $72^{\circ}$F} is the temperature desired for this room.
But all thermostats and switching devices require a differential zone of temperature change in which to go on and off; otherwise they would act too frequently and probably erratically because of vibration conditions and momentary temperature fluctuations in the immediate neighborhood of the thermostat.
We start with the temperature dropping in the upper curve of this figure. When the temperature reaches the lower edge of the differential temperature zone ($71^{\circ}$F in Fig. 6.10(a)), the thermostat switch turns on the heater.
This assumes that there are no significant time delays in the response of the thermostat or the heater controls.
(In actual experience there are always some delays.)
The radiators around the room take much more time to heat up, and the temperature of the air in the room continues to drop until it reaches some point which is well below the lower limit of the control range (about \ang{70} in Fig. 6.10(a)).


<figure>
\label{fig:6.10}
\caption{Relation of room temperature and thermostat to the power input to a room-temperature control system.}
</figure>


As the hot radiators heat the air in the room, the temperature at the thermostat starts to climb again, and at the $73^{\circ}$F level the heaters are turned off.
But at that point the radiators are fully hot, and the air in the room continues to receive heat and to rise to a maximum temperature which is well above $73^{\circ}$F.
The net result is that the room temperature may vary by as much as four or more degrees Fahrenheit.
In an actual system there will be a little time lag between the temperature at $71^{\circ}$F or $73^{\circ}$F and the response of the thermostat and heater controls, which can make the overshoot and hunting more severe.
Nevertheless, the simplicity and relatively low cost of on-off systems makes them very attractive for use in such operations as controlling temperatures, maintaining water level in tanks, and many other operations.
Biological and some social systems, as well as many industrial, mechanical, and chemical processes, usually require the more accurate control that can be achieved through proportional-type systems.

How much power can an on-off system control?
It is fairly clear that the switch that turns the heater on and off can be designed to handle any amount of electric or other form of energy.
The amount depends on the power requirements to keep the variable that is being controlled as close to the desired value as possible.


A general rule might be to design the power level so that the controller calls for heat about half the time, and the heater remains off half the total time.
Sometimes the control is improved by supplying a portion of the power continuously at a low, fixed level, and allowing the control system to add or subtract a smaller increment of power as needed.


## Characteristics of proportional control
\label{sec:6.10}


The on-off type of temperature control, in which the power is usually turned full-on or full-off, is inadequate for many applications that cannot tolerate the wide surges around the desired control point that often accompany on-off systems.
The undesirable surges can be reduced if the power is moderated in proportion to the need.
This is exactly what is achieved in proportional control systems, in which the heat input continues at some intermediate level when the temperature is near the desired control point.
As the temperature rises somewhat, the controller reduces the heat input in proportion to the departure from the set control point.
Similarly, the heat input is increased in proportion to a fall in temperature below the set control point.
Of course the system becomes more complicated because now the temperature detector must measure the magnitude of departure from the control point.
(In on-off control, all that the detector has to do is to note that the temperature is above or below the set point.)
Also, there must be somewhat more complex interconnection so that the proportionate (or step-bv-step) changes in the temperature detector can be translated into proportionate (or step-by-step) action on the part of the valve or motor that controls the fuel or power input.


<figure>
\label{fig:6.11}
\caption{
    In a proportional control system, the response of the thermostat is proportional to the departure of room temperature from the desired control point and the change in power input to the boiler is proportional to the response of the thermostat.
}
</figure>


Let us analyze the action of such a system designed to control the temperature in a room.

When the door of the room opens and lets in a draft of cold air, the thermostat responds as shown by the drop in the upper curve of Fig. 6.11.
As shown by the middle curve, at that same time the thermostat control calls for a proportional increase of heat, and the heaters respond as shown by the lower curve.
As the draft of cold air becomes warmed somewhat by mixing with the warmer air, the proportional thermostat correspondingly reduces its demand for heat.
The net result is that the room temperature is maintained much more closely to the desired $72^{\circ}$F than is possible with on-off control.
But the proportional control instruments and equipment tend to be more expensive, and for that reason they are not used where on-off control is adequate.


A serious limitation develops in proportional control systems when the load demand changes so that a different average power level must be applied to hold the variable at the desired control value.
To understand this, we note that in proportional control, the output <span class="math">&Delta;O</span> (Fig. 6.4) has a fixed ratio to the input <span class="math">&Delta;I</span>.
This proportionality ratio, or gain, may be represented by $G = \Delta O/ \Delta I$.
Assume that the room-temperature control we have been discussing is set to control at $72^{\circ}$F when the outdoor temperature is around $50^{\circ}$F.
We may assume that this requires an average heat input of 10,000 Btu per hour.
Suppose that the outdoor temperature drops to $0^{\circ}$F.
Obviously, the heater system must provide a great deal more heat to hold the temperature at $72^{\circ}$F, say, 30,000 Btu per hour.
We therefore need an additional $30,000-10,000}=20,000$ Btu per hour to hold the temperature at $72^{\circ}$F.
But since in proportional control more heat is provided only in proportion to the temperature drop from the control setting, how can the additional heat be provided without the actual temperature remaining well below the desired control value?


Let us analyze the situation a little more quantitatively.
Suppose that the gain of our control is set so that, for each degree that the temperature drops, the controller permits an additional 2,000 Btu per hour to be supplied to the boiler.
This represents a gain or proportionality ratio of 2,000 Btu per hour per degree fahrenheit.
To get the additional 20,000 Btu would require that the temperature of the room go down to $62^{\circ}$F.
Or, alternatively, the thermostat setting would have to be moved arbitrarily to about $80^{\circ}$F in order to supply enough heat to hold the room temperature at $72^{\circ}$F as long as the outdoor temperature remained at zero.

This discrepancy could be reduced if the gain were made higher (that is, $1^{\circ}$F could turn on much more than an additional 2,000 Btu per hour).
But making the gain higher also makes the system more unstable.
Other devices can be introduced to change the responsiveness of the controller, such as incorporating into the system an outdoor thermostat that introduces this equivalent of the arbitrary shift of a thermostat setting of $80^{\circ}$F.
We need not go into more detail beyond recognizing this severe limitation of proportional control systems.

## Feedback
\label{sec:6.11}

We must give a little more attention to the important feedback function.
When the thermostat of a temperature-control system demands more heat, the additional heat energy continues to pour into the heater boilers and radiators until feedback information (in the form of rising air temperature in its neighborhood) reverses the thermostat demand.
In the case of the driver of the automobile, although his foot on the accelerator finds good proportional power response on the part of the motor, only feedback in the form of vision (and the transformation of that information into suitable muscle action) makes driving successful.
Without the presence of feedback, the driver could not function as part of the system.

The kind as well as the timing (or <em>phase relationship</em>; see Sect. 6.3) of feedback are rather important.
In the case of the temperature controller, the electrical thermostat reactions must become transformed into heat energy and transfer of this energy to the room if there is to be control of <em>temperature</em>.
In the case of the driver, the feedback which arrives in the form of sensory information must become interpreted and converted into suitable muscle action on the accelerator pedal to be effective.

In the case of temperature control the feedback must always be <em>negative</em>.
That is, the rising room temperature causes the thermostat to demand less heat, while a dropping temperature causes it to demand more heat.
In the case of driving an automobile, the feedback may be negative (say, when the traffic light turns red and the driver has to let up on the accelerator) or positive (say, when the way is clear for higher speed).
When a politician confronts his voting constituents on an important issue, he watches their reactions as he talks, to get some form of feedback, When the response (or feedback) from the audience is &ldquo;positive,&rdquo; he believes that his statements have been received favorably, whereas a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; feedback is likely to make him cautious.


Feedback may take many forms and many types of coupling.
Figure 6.12 illustrates a simple modification of an earlier graph.
In this illustration some of the output energy is fed back to the input.
The box marked &ldquo;feedback transfer&rdquo; determines how much of and in what form the output will be fed back.
The input is represented by a long arrow with positive increment.
The feedback is shown as a small arrow with negative value.
In such a setup the net input is <em>reduced</em> by the amount of the negative feedback.
The effect is to restrain or to limit the output.
If the sign of the feedback were positive, the input and the feedback would add and the output would increase continually and build up to destruction, or to the limit of the energy input.
A system with feedback is often referred to as a closed-loop system.
Since such systems incorporate a measure of self-correction, the exact value that the input is permitted to have becomes less critical.
This self-correction factor also applies to the automobile driver, who does not have to have a gauge on the foot pedal because the &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; of his eyes and ears is enough to guide and restrain his push on the foot pedal.


High values for gain in amplifiers or control circuits tend to make a system unstable, and time lags produce wider oscillations. Negative feedback, on the other hand, tends to stabilize the systems.

## The elements of control systems
\label{sec:6.12}


Now that we have developed some familiarity with control systems, we can identify the functional elements that make up most systems.


<span class="textsc">The variable to be controlled</span>


First there is the variable that the system is expected to cope with or to control within prescribed limits.
Actually it is rare that only one variable is present in a system.
In the case of room-temperature control the changes in the outdoor temperature constitute an independent variable, while the internal temperature represents the controlled variable.
Other independent variables may be introduced, such as children running in and out of open doors, to cause variable demands for more or less heating.


<figure>
\label{fig:6.12}
\caption{Addition of a feedback transfer function to the transform function of Fig. 6.4.}
</figure>


Similarly, the driver of the automobile has control devices by which he steers and starts and stops the car in relation to the road.
But all along the way he is forced to comply with independent demands, such as changing road and traffic conditions, stop signs, and traffic lights, all of which constitute independent variables.

<span class="textsc">Sensor Devices</span>

Usually there must be some sensor device by which the variable can be measured or gauged.
For example, in the case of the temperature measurement we shall learn in Chapter 10 that the temperature of air is actually determined by the velocity of the molecules that make up air.
But we cannot gauge the temperature by measuring the velocity of molecules directly.
What we can do is to utilize some <em>effect</em> that changes with changing molecule velocity.
For example: At high air temperature, molecules in a material become more active and bump each other harder and more frequently, causing objects such as fluid in a thermometer or a piece of metal in a thermostat to warm up.
A thermostat usually includes a bimetal
\footnote{
    A bimetal strip is made up of two different metals bonded together.
    Because the two metals have different temperature expansion coefficients, the bimetal will bend when heated, thus causing the contact to switch on the system.
    As it cools, it straightens and contact is terminated.
}
that carries an electrical contact; the bimetal changes its position when the air temperature changes and thus makes or breaks an electric circuit.


Similarly, while the position and behavior of the automobile are the variables to be controlled, we gauge these by the use of sensory information (vision, hearing) and the interpretive processes of the brain.
The economist also looks for meaningful indices by which to gauge the larger features of national product, industrial trends, and public attitudes.
The public utilizes quality and creativity as gauges to evaluate intrinsic or extrinsicreturn on investment.

<span class="textsc">Energy Source</span>

Whether one deals with a temperaturecontrol system, driving an automobile, or any other situation that involves variables and controls, there must be a source of energy by which the job is performed.

<span class="textsc">Motor Transform Device</span>

In most instances the sensor function must utilize the services of a motor device to restore a variable to its proper value.
To do this the motor device, or motor function, utilizes energy from an energy source.
In the temperature-control system, the blowers and burners (which are triggered into action by the thermostat) begin to utilize fuel energy to heat the boilers.
In the automobile a number of mechanisms come into play to burn the gasoline, to power the steering, and to perform other nondriver functions.

<span class="textsc">Feedback</span>

Finally there is a feedback device, or feedback function, which in one way or another relates the output to the input and thus controls the net output.

The functional elements of a system cannot always be identified individually or even as subsystems, but they are present in one form or another.
One characteristic that will be evident more and more is the wide variety of transformations (transform functions) that are possible in systems.
Molecular speeds are transformed into mechanical bending of a bimetal, which completes an electric circuit and utilizes electric energy.
This in turn starts a motor and pump device to feed and burn oil in a boiler, which produces heat that is transported or transferred by various means to another area by other motor devices.
Similarly, all the tangible and intangible features of human physical energy and human brain processes become involved with electromechanical and chemical systems in driving an automobile.
(For each of these transformations we can apply the more elegant phrase transform function, and illustrate the nature of the transformation by means of a mathematical equation, a graph, a listing of data, or a simple picture.)


## Control concepts: cybernetics
\label{sec:6.13}

The art and science of control theory has had a long and slow history.
In the early days it found application in the sailing and steering of ships.
With the coming of the steam engine a mechanical governor was needed to keep the speed of the engine constant.
In more recent decades a wide variety of instruments, valves, and other equipment have been developed to maintain uniformity in chemical production processes.
Servomechanisms were introduced during World War I for control of gunfire.
Electric circuitry and electromechanical systems were given intensive study to improve their responsiveness and stability for purposes of controlling high-speed operations.
By the 1940&#39;s the pace of automation had quickened as the concepts of control theory and of feedback received wider application in the electrical, mechanical, and processing industries.
The term <em>high-fidelity</em> became a byword in amplifier design as a result of the introduction of negative feedback.


But the concept of feedback seemed to be basic and useful for a much wider range of applications.
In 1947 the mathematician Norbert Wiener and Arturo Rosenbleuth compared the phenomena of control and of feedback, as used in technology, to the nervous system and muscle behavior of the human body.
They postulated a close coordination of communication relationships between the brain, the sensory organs, and the muscles, and concluded that this resulted from the extensive use of feedback principles.
It seemed that a feedback function is responsible for one&#39;s ability to reach down and pick up an object and to know how much farther the hand must move to complete the act.
Moreover, they found an identity between feedback and information and the information content of a signal above the noise level.
They gave the name cybernetics (from the Greek kybernes for steersman) to the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal.
\footnote{
    The broad concepts that make up the science of cybernetics as developed by Wiener and his associates were new.
    The word itself had much older origin, however.
    It appears that Plato often employed the word &ldquo;cybernetics&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;the steermans art.&rdquo;
    His comment in &ldquo;Cleitophon,&rdquo; &ldquo;the cybernetics of men, as you, Socrates, often call politics,&rdquo; suggests a wider implication.
    In 1834 the French physicist Ampere used the word as &ldquo;means of governing&rdquo; people.
}

The concepts of <em>feedback</em> and <em>information</em> encompassed by cybernetics permit very extensive applications to the biological and social world.
Just as the driver of the automobile performs functions in response to the information he derives from seeing and hearing and evaluating the driving situation, so his reactions under other situations are the result of his relationship or interaction with each new environment.
Information and feedback are essential to his every move, every decision, almost every thought and learning process.


We shall have many opportunities to refer to the principles that have just been introduced.
There will be applications to strictly technical systems, to systems that involve nature&#39;s resources, to biological systems, and to social situations.


The importance of the subject suggests that we summarize a few of the ideas that are most pertinent to our purposes.


1. Nature&#39;s processes are characterized by continuous dynamic transformations of energy, which may range from the vast magnitudes of astrophysics to the metabolic adaptation of the smallest living organism to its environment.

2. Much of man&#39;s own activities also involves the development of processes for conversion and utilization of nature&#39;s energy resources for purposes of assuring his survival and comfort.
Indeed, the design of systems that integrate physical and chemical variables into cooperative, controlled systems constitutes a main interest of science and industry to bring about modern civilization and the current standard of living of advanced nations.

3. It is now recognized that the elements that make up a controlled system have common characteristics, whether accomplished by machine components, biological elements, thought processes, or social situations.

4. In such systems, the element of feedback, or information, which interrelates the output (or behavior) of the system and the input variables, constitutes a major factor for the effective operation and stability of systems.

5. The design of every control system requires careful analysis (and usually compromise) to meet the needs of the process.
A prime requisite for most control systems is that they be adequately responsive to changes, and that they be stable.
Also needed is an adequate source of energy to perform all the functions that are required of the system.
The input to the system may be some variable such as temperature, liquid level, or pressure.
Or it may be information that is itself the product of other operations, such as in computer systems.


6. The system performs its function bv transforming the input to produce an output whose energy content is usually amplified, the added energy being derived from the source of energy of the system.
The character of the transformation is designed into the system and is identified by its transform function to give the change or amplification gain to the output.

7. When a feedback (or information) loop permits some of the energy of the output to be fed back to the input, there can be considerable influence on the nature of the net output and on the stability of the system.
In general, feedback that opposes changes (negative) in the input will improve the stability of the system, while feedback that arrives at the input in a manner that increases its changes (positive feedback) tends to reduce the stability of a system.

8. The stability of the system suffers and the system &ldquo;hunts&rdquo; more violently when the amplification or gain between output and input is too high or when the system responds too quickly to changes in the input variable.
The design must include enough damping to reduce excessive overshoot (or violent hunting) of the system while still providing adequate response.
On-off controls offer cost advantages and simplicity, but the need for better control may dictate the use of proportional control or of other controls that have more sophisticated design. 
There can be more than one input to a system, more than one output, and a wide variety of interrelated combinations.
In fact, the input may be the statistical output of many interrelated elements or variables.

<figure>
\label{fig:6.13}
\caption{The complex interrelationship of man with his environment.}
</figure>


## Some examples of systems
\label{sec:6.14}

In Fig. 6.13, which illustrates the relationship of man to his environment, we have identified two aspects of man (his brain and sensory motor system as distinguished from his physical being) and two aspects of his enviornment (the physical and social environments).
There is very intimate and extensive interchange between the two aspects of man and between the two aspects of environment, as shown by the proximity and multiple arrows connecting them.
Man draws energy and material from the physical environment and returns information and other materials to both.
\footnote{
    It is not easy to distinguish work from information and learning.
    Physical acts are not readily distinguishable as being separate from sensory response and interpretation that leads to learning, judgment, and decision. 
    Certainly we cannot say that the throwing of a ball, intake of food, reading of newsprint, and a walk around the block are not so much mental processes that lead to future decision or action as they are physical acts.
}

In the case of the driving of an automobile, it is difficult to identify all the elements that make up the input to this system.
The desire to drive, the sensory activity that provides data to the brain, and the muscle behavior that operates the controls of the car, each is a complex that includes and combines the product of some other part of the system.
The energy involved in the seeing, hearing, and judgement operations is negligibly small, but these become greatly magnified by the body&#39;s metabolic processes.
This transform function of the body is most complex, and is itself made up of innumerable subsystems.


The specific control principles and systems we have discussed thus far are given broader significance by the principles of cybernetics.
Cybernetics deals with elements or variables that are related to each other so intimately that a change in one variable is likely to affect other variables in the system.
The elements may be parts of a machine or those of a chemical process.
Cybernetics can deal with the very specific behavior of a single molecule among vast numbers of gas molecules or with the behavior of a single cell of the vast numbers that make up an organism.
It can as readily (and in general more usefully) consider the statistical-behavior character of all the gas molecules together, or all the cells of the human body.
It can provide a method for analyzing the economic relationship of a grocer and his customer, or as readily attack questions pertaining to the economics of a whole nation.
It establishes functional relationships in the course of changes, emphasizing their coordination, regulation, and control within a systems concept.


From the point of view of cybernetics, the aspect of systems behavior that is of greatest interest is the system&#39;s response to a disturbance.
This disturbance may be a normal change or a momentary departure (transient) of the input, say as a result of the dropping of temperature of an industrial oven below its control setting when cold material is poured into it.
One or more of the input variables or signals may experience changes that sum up to a signal sufficiently large to initiate a major change.
For example, many chemical processes go on within the body, such as food intake, digestion, blood cell production, and oxygen utilization.
They are not unrelated and all must be considered contributory to whether a person feels well or feels ill.
Each process experiences its own daily or hourly variations, which nevertheless may constitute normal operation and good health.
There can be occasions, however, when the individual variations in the processes add up to produce sickness of a sort that represents serious imbalance or disturbance of the total system.
\footnote{
    As a simple example, the experience of sitting in an awkward position can introduce a combination of neural signals and mental process that suggests the need for a new position and thereby requires a complete readjustment of nerve and muscle systems.
}

In general, systems are designed to accept and to cope with very specific variables and to effect reasonably quick restoration whenever some change in those variables upsets equilibrium.
The system is considered to be responsive when it reacts with adequate speed to the upset. A system that responds too quickly or introduces corrective steps that are too large is likely to produce instability around the equilibrium point.
A system may also be too sensitive to small fluctuations that are of the order of magnitude of background &ldquo;noise,&rdquo; and for that reason will be unstable.


We might consider the design of an electrical amplifier system such as that used for a quality phonograph system. 
Figure 6.12 represents a fairly simple circuit for transforming an input through some form of transducer to produce an output.
The feedback to the input in this case was designed to counteract or oppose the input, tending to reduce undesirable excursions in the output due to variations other than the sound signals to be amplified.
The system constitutes a channel for transmitting and transposing signals, the input signals being information.
To be effective, the design must usually incorporate suitable capabilities in such terms as capacity, watts, voltage, range, and frequency.
These in turn provide the basis for designing suitable constraints into the system.


However, a control system is not likely to be designed to control every variable against every change.
For example, the body&#39;s control of the iris openings of the eyes (to permit only adequate light to reach the retina) has a very specific, limited function and purpose, which excludes sensitivity to other variations of body conditions.
The purpose of constraints is to reduce the response of the system to variables that are not considered to be part of the information to be transmitted.
There are also natural restraints or constraints on the information and on the variety of information that a channel may transmit.
Among these are the limitations and directions imposed by the conservation of energy and the laws of thermodynamics.
When a system combines several elements into an integrated organizational and functional interdependence, the interdependence automatically imposes constraints, since the elements are now no longer independent of each other.
An amplifier system may have to contend with constraints in the form of costs, against which the designer must balance extra quality or fidelity or amplification.


With only minor modifications the diagram of Fig. 6.12 can represent a quite different system for communication of information.
Figure 6.14 illustrates some of the elements that enter into a system for communicating news to the general public.
News may be collected from many areas and reported; this news becomes input ($i_1, i_2, &hellip; i_n$) to the editorial offices of a news agency.
At the editorial offices this information undergoes modification and shaping, and is put into printed form or given electrical broadcast.
There will be close liaison among the several blocks that make up the channels for this communication.
There will be government influences as well as government sources of information bearing on the editorial and management offices, much of it in the form of feedback reaction to the communication.
The listening and reading public applies &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; influence through financial support (or lack of support) of the broadcast and publishing services, through the editorial offices, and through government offices to the sources of information.
The constraints in such a system are many.
They arise from national and local government policies; from elec- trical, chemical, mechanical restraints; from the cultural habits and educational level of communities; and from financial considerations.
As a total result, such a communication system becomes not a simple amplifier and distributor of simple news information but also a combination system for receiving, modifying, transmitting, and generating of news with built-in restraints and objectives.

<figure>
\label{fig:6.14}
\caption{Schematic representation of a system for communicating news to the public.}
</figure>


One interesting characteristic of a system of this sort arises from the fact that any one of the multiple input signals ($i_1, i_2, i_3, &hellip; i_n$) can suddenly introduce a major disturbance that overshadows all other input signals and that can bring about violent response in either the forward channels or the feedback channels.
Such a disturbance might be an act of war, a strike, a catastrophe, or an event that is especially disliked or especially desirable.
There may be quite a few surges of output beyond the desired limits of control before the system settles down again.

One may also conceive that the input ($i_1, &hellip; i_n$) can be made up of very many items and elements so that the overall significance of the input is determined by the statistical character of the input rather than being overly influenced by any one item.

## Functional relationship: notations
\label{sec:6.15}

In its simplest form, a cause-and-effect relationship is stated as a simple function such as $y=f(x)$ (meaning <span class="math">y</span> is a function <span class="math">f</span> of <span class="math">x</span>, or $O=f(I)$ (meaning output <span class="math">O</span> is a function of input <span class="math">I</span>).
In diagram form this might be written
\footnote{
    The approach in this section is considerably influenced by the treatment given by W. Ross Ashbv.
}
as representing a transition of <span class="math">I</span> into an output <span class="math">O</span>.
Relating
\begin{center}
    %% NOTE: intex picture
\end{center}
this to our earlier example of the automobile, the power of the motor, <span class="math">O</span>, is some function of the position of the accelerator pedal, <span class="math">I</span>.
If we include the driver as well, we have a more complete system with feedback and our equation would have to provide a different function for output,

\begin{equation*}
    O = f(I) F(O)
\end{equation*}

In its simplest form the diagram would be changed to become
\begin{center}
    %% NOTE: intex picture
\end{center}

The more interesting examples are not likely to be so simple as to comprise only a single input and single output. 
Within the total system that includes the auto and driver, there are innumerable smaller systems such as cells, neurons, muscles, organs, machine parts, and electrical controls.
A study of such assemblies must set out clear objectives before its approach or results can be made significant.
For example, are the functions to be studied primarily those that pertain to keeping the auto on the road, or are they functions that determine the state of the driver&#39;s gall bladder, heart beat, or temperature?
These subsidiary systems are certainly part of the total system of man and auto, but their details are independent of the specific functions that go with driving the automobile.
The situation would be different, of course, if part of a study had to do with the effect of heart or temperature function on the driving, for which purpose a new set of elements would be involved when making up the system to be studied.
The situation is illustrated by Ashby in the following diagram, in which one may trace twenty different
\footnote{
    It is suggested that the reader list the twenty different ways in which a signal may travel through the system, starting at <span class="math">A</span> and returning ultimately to <span class="math">A</span> in each case.
    For example, $ABCDA$ or $ABCBCDA$.
} circuits.


Each subsidiary circuit may have its own mode of feedback and control, and may be either strongly or weakly linked with neighboring circuits.
In the case of our driver, vision plays the dominant role in telling him where the auto is going, while his knowledge of the situation is helped by the senses of hearing and by the sensations of his body as the car sways.
All the input stimuli have some relation to each other.
One may picture a strong relationship (or strong coupling) between vision and hearing and a weaker coupling between heartbeat and vision, as far as driving the car is concerned.


Any study must therefore seek first to identify the functionally significant relationships that are the subject of the study, to identify the elements that bear directly on the functions under study, and to eliminate from consideration those elements that are independent of the selected functions.
\footnote{
    The importance of such an approach in the study of human behavior is seen in the Gestalt psychology view of phenomena.
}
This is not easy to do in most cases because there are many varieties of influences and &ldquo;couplings&rdquo; that come into play.
Often the study must assume a series of situations and obtain results and estimates for a wide variety of combinations of systems.

<span class="textsc">Models</span>

Often it becomes necessary to simplify a system or make it understandable by use of a model or models.
This becomes imperative for nearly all biological systems, which are enormously complex.
But models can very quickly become detrimental to progress when one loses sight of the simplifications and limitations that are inherent to each model.


## &ldquo;Black box&rdquo; approach
\label{sec:6.16}

Ashby considers the interesting case of an experimenter approaching a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; that is unknown to him with respect to contents and functions.
How should he proceed to investigate and determine the contents and character of the box?

(The procedure can be especially important if one imagines that the &ldquo;black box&rdquo; could be an explosive bomb.)
There is, immediately, a relationship between the experimenter and the box, of the type shown in Fig. 6.15.
The diagram illustrates the nature of exchanges and feedback that take place as the experimenter explores the problem by various means. 
The &ldquo;means&rdquo; presumably might include such things as pushing and pulling of the box and levers.
For a systematic search, each move would be recorded along with the &ldquo;state&rdquo; of the box that accompanied each move.
In time the experimenter would presumably be able to identify the &ldquo;state&rdquo; of the box for each type of input, and possibly also the function for each type of input.
Many of the systems with which we deal are actually made up of &ldquo;black boxes,&rdquo; and the functional characteristics of the total assembly may be determined by the characteristics of each box and by the nature of their coupling together,
\footnote{
    The reader may picture the similar situation that exists when he first meets a person who is to become liis associate on some project.
}
But we may fail to characterize the system because a combination of black boxes may produce an unexpected function that is quite unrelated to the characteristics of any one box.
An example given by Ashbv is that the approximately twenty amino acids in a bacterium do not individually have the property of being self-replicating, but their combination does introduce this property.

Real-life problems tend to have main &ldquo;black boxes,&rdquo; often interconnected in such manner as to obscure the specific role of each box, each subsystem.
One may make progress in the analysis of the total system and its parts by systematic analysis of &ldquo;responses&rdquo; or &ldquo;states&rdquo; to questions and input stimuli.
One may seek to discover factors that produce certain extreme &ldquo;responses&rdquo; of &ldquo;states.&rdquo;
The use of computers helps handle large quantities of data and identify common elements or contrasts.
But progress in attacking complex problems depends more often on good use of judgment, experience, intuition or insight, persistence, and some luck.
It is not always easy to identify and isolate the specific functions that are of importance for the system&#39;s functioning.
There may be multitudinous other elements within the total system that do not bear on the specific functions under study.

## The closed-loop amplifier system\footnote{The sections printed in color represent optional reading material.}
\label{sec:6.17}

It will be helpful to look a little more closely at the quantitative aspects of a system that has feedback characteristics. 
Figure 6.16 illustrates a system in which an input signal <span class="math">E</span>, (which may be in volts and related to temperature, pressure, blood count, or other variable) constitutes the control variable.
The system may be designed to do something that is proportional to or determined by this control variable <span class="math">i</span>.
If the system is a servomechanism, input <span class="math">E_i</span>, may represent the angle of rotation of a small motor and output <span class="math">E_O</span> the angle of rotation of a larger motor, the objective being to keep the two motors in step with each other.
Or <span class="math">E_i</span>, may be the input voltage from a measuring circuit that has high resistance and low power and which is to be converted to an identical voltage in a low-resistance circuit to operate a loudspeaker or solenoid or some other device that requires more power than is available at the input end of the circuit.
(Throughout this discussion keep in mind that there must be a source of energy to make this conversion possible, as is illustrated in Fig. 6.16.)

The signal <span class="math">E_i</span>, may have a fixed value or may vary with time.
It feeds into a comparator element, where <span class="math">E_i</span>, is compared (added) to the signal coming as feedback.
It both the input signal and or
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:6-2}
    E_0 = E_i \left(\frac{G}{1+(FR)G}\right) + E_D \left(\frac{1}{1 + (FR) G}\right)
\end{equation}

For the above example,
\begin{align*}
    E_0 &= 1 \left(\frac{10}{1+(1\times 10}\right) + 0 \left(\frac{1}{1 + 1\times 10}\right) \\
        & \frac{10}{11}\text{volt}
\end{align*}

<figure>
\label{fig:6.16}
\caption{A closed-loop amplifying system. }
</figure>

The error or difference voltage therefore becomes $E_i - E_f = 1 - \frac{10}{11} = \frac{1}{11}$volt.
The amplifier must be capable of acting on this voltage if the system is designed to work on such magnitudes of error.
One way to improve this is to increase the gain G of the amplifier.
If, in this case, the gain G is increased from 10 to 100 while keeping the feedback ratio and E D the same, the error voltage reduces to 1/101 volt from 1/11 volt.
It can be seen that the gain can change markedly without introducing serious error in such a system.

Finally suppose there develops a disturbance E D amounting to 0.5 volt, with the gain G = 10 and FR = 1.
From the last term of Eq. (6-2), the effect of the disturbance reduces to
\begin{equation*}
    0.5 \frac{1}{1+1\times 10} = \frac{0.5}{11}
\end{equation*}

as a result of the feedback.
Figure 6.17 presents these figures applied directly to the diagram of Fig. 6.16 (following the example of James E. Randall, Elements of Biophysics).


The examples thus far apply to staticsystems.
The behavior of systems varies considerably when the input voltage changes too rapidly for the system to follow the changes of <span class="math">E_i</span> or <span class="math">E_D</span>.
The subject of controller stability has received a great deal of attention in connection with servomechanism design (for remote control of airplane movements, and similar applications) and electric circuit design for communication, but we cannot delve into that aspect of controller theory.
However, one related consideration is &ldquo;noise,&rdquo; mentioned briefly in an earlier discussion.
This also has had considerable study because of the important effect on the capacity of circuitry to convey &ldquo;information.&rdquo;


## The nature of &ldquo;living&rdquo; systems
\label{sec:6.18}

In the discussions of control systems thus far we have not distinguished between systems involving machine components and those involving living systems.
Nor is it our intention to do so now.
The fact is that, except for varying complexity, the very same concepts may be applied to living as well as nonliving or machine systems.
Each of the sensory organs through which we communicate with the much vaster system of nature is itself designed, oriented, and functionally controlled to achieve certain specific goals or &ldquo;purposes.&rdquo;
It does not matter whether we discuss a nerve cell or an electric wire connection.
Both are motorsensors.
Information may be transmitted through the medium of voice, teletype, wireless, visual signals, or the raising of an eyebrow.
Each may be an element of a system, and a composite system may include many elements or subsystems.
The science of information theory must cope with vast complications to determine the maximum and minimum informational content that an actual system can transmit, even when the role and nature of each link of the chain can be fairly understood.

The acts of stretching the bodv or of reaching to pick up an object entail the function of a fairly complex system of regulation and control.
This has been demonstrated by Karl Smith&#39;s
\footnote{
    See K. V. Smith.
}
experiments with delayed visual feedback in visual motor behavior, which showed that what a person sees is delayed in reaching him when he is performing various other tasks such as writing.

The <em>intention</em> to stretch or to pick up an object is itself a complex function, developing in the mind as a product of other activities and influences.
The <em>command signal</em>, in the form of nerve impulses, originate in the motor cortex of the brain and initiates action in the muscle contractile proteins.
There is an amplification, <span class="math">G</span>, which may be expressed as change in muscle length for a unit change in the motor neurons that initiate the discharges.
The muscle spindle acts as a sensor-transducer to produce nerve impulses, in proportion to muscle length extension, to send back to the brain as <em>feedback</em> on the extension.
The original impulses and the feedback impulses are integrated in the spinal cord and give indication of the error or difference from completion of the intended act.
The spindle proprioceptors serve to provide constant information on the state and tone of the muscle system, and assure smooth action of the body.
When an individual is deprived of their help, muscle activity tends to be abrupt rather than smooth, requiring dependence on visual sense of position to the extent that he cannot stand when blindfolded.


A person suffering from Parkinson&#39;s disease retains some benefit from proprioceptive information, but tends to overshoot when reaching for an object&emdash;a motion that recalls damped oscillation.

In later studies of biological systems we shall have occasion to study in some detail a few of the regulatory systems on which life depends.
Figure 6.18 illustrates how the sodium ion concentration is maintained constant in the fluid that surrounds the individual cells.
There is an elaborate system for maintaining uniform pressure in the circulation of blood. 
Pressure-sensitive transducers, located in the aorta and carotid arteries, send information about the magnitude of the pressure to an integrating center within the medullary portion of the brain.
This results in action that lowers blood pressure by slowing the heart rate and also by producing vascular dilatation.


For respiration there is needed a minimal value for blood carbon dioxide and an adequate supply of blood oxygen.
When carbon dioxide concentration in the blood increases, the medullary respiratory center stimulates respiration to eliminate carbon dioxide.
The transit time for the flow of blood between the lungs and the respiratory center is only a few seconds under normal conditions (see Randall, p. 108).
Body temperature is maintained by a delicate balance between heat loss (from warm-blooded or homeothermic animals) and heat production within the animal through metabolism.
The &ldquo;thermostat&rdquo; that controls this balance is located in the hypothalmus of the brain and receives information from various temperature transducers of the body to guide its own function.

The regulatory system can extend beyond the body to include the interactions involving climate, geography, geology, agriculture, theology, government, disease, or any other influences.
The elements of determinate function, disturbances, control variables, amplification, feedback, informational content, are all three, but they may take the forms of imposed law, self-imposed law, self-imposed restraints, religious restraints, moral obligations, and many other forms that are even less tangible.

The regulatory principles apply to commercial production plants where orders for goods become converted to products for sale, with often quick and direct feedback from consumer to producer.
The economist must be aware of the relationship of the key elements of a nation&#39;s economy in terms that are identical to those discussed, if he is to succeed in regulating the ups and downs of business within manageable proportions.
The problem becomes especially severe when each of the elements of the system is a result of statistical variations, and the statistics lack the assurance of experience or of numbers.
The difficulties too often savor of the uncertainties of &ldquo;black boxes,&rdquo; and yet one must select a suitable model, suitably simple to be manageable and not too far removed from the realities of the situation.


The student is urged to study carefully all the details that have been included in this section on controls.
In time he will find that many of the topics that are to come in later chapters will fall more easily into place.
For nature and man exist and continue as a result of a balance of forces and utilization of energy, the whole constituting a system that is in a state of reasonable balance and regulation and yet continually changing toward wholly new forms.


In conclusion, we hope that this brief introduction to systems and cybernetics will encourage each reader to view the events of his life with keener appreciation for the interrelationship of the factors that bear on the events, and especially for feedback influences.
A word of caution is in order, however, with respect to overextended use of the term cybernetics to situations wherein the relationships are too complex or too obscure, and wherein there are not present the control systems elements which we have discussed.

<span class="textsc">Questions/Discussions</span>

The assignments for this chapter are intended to give the reader opportunity to discover for himself how broadly the concepts and techniques involving systems, feedback, control, stability-insta-bility, and cybernetics apply to phenomena in nature and to all aspects of human social relations.
It is suggested that from two to four weeks be allowed for completion of this work.

1. For purposes of review, tabulate the five elements of control systems (described in Sec. 6.12) that apply in the following personal situations.
Explain also whether the feedback is positive or negative in each case.

(a) The control of temperature of your home.

(b) The factors that control your waking up on a weekday morning.

(c) The factors that control your break-fasting.

(d) One situation or experience of your day that includes strong positive feedback.

(e) A situation or experience of your day that includes strong negative feedback.

2. Select three phenomena or situations, taken from any three of the following categories, and analyze their &ldquo;systems&rdquo; aspects in the following terms:

(a) The dependent and independent variables that are involved in each, either as &ldquo;input&rdquo; to the system or as disturbances.

(b) The sensor devices or transform functions required at the input end for each variable.

(c) The energy sources.

(d) The motor devices or processes, and the related transform functions.

(e) The gain or amplification between output and input.

(f) The nature of feedback influences (distinguishing between positive and negative feedback and phase relationships) related to each input and each output.

(g) The nature of subsystems that are included.

(h) The factors that make for stability and instability in the total system or subsystems.

(i) The graphical representation of the above elements and processes, with indication of polarity (direction) of feedback between each output and input.

The phenomena or situations are to be drawn from any three of the following seven categories:

I Electromechanical, pneumatic systems, chemical or production processes

II Geophysical or meteorological processes

III Biological processes (plants, animals), ecological relationships

IV Medical, pathological experiences V Economics (international, national, or personal), business operations VI Behavioral, cultural, ethical, moral, theological, and psychological aspects of social experiences

Note: It is suggested that each &ldquo;case&rdquo; be given adequate discussion and one to two pages of graphical representation.
Because of the importance of the subject of &ldquo;systems,&rdquo; it is suggested that these analyses be given time for class discussion.
Group effort on the part of the students is encouraged, although each must present his own final case study.
