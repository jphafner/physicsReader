## Albert Einstein

Albert Einstein, considered to be the most creative physical scientist since Newton, was nevertheless a humble and sometimes rather shy man.
He was born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879. He seemed to learn so slowly that his parents feared that he might be retarded.
After graduating to the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, he became a junior official at the Patent Office at Berne.
At the age of twentysix, and quite unknown, he published three revolutionary papers in theoretical physics in 1905.
The first paper extended Max Planck&#39;s ideas of quantization of energy, and established the quantum theory of radiation.
For this work he received the Nobel Prize for 1921.
The second paper gave a mathematical theory of Brownian motion, yielding a calculation of the size of a molecule.
His third paper founded the special theory of relativity.
Einstein&#39;s later work centered on the general theory of relativity.
His work had a profound influence not only on physics, but also on philosophy.
An eloquent and widely beloved man, Einstein took an active part in liberal and antiwar movements.
Fleeing from Nazi Germany, he settled in the United States in 1933 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.

From 1768 to 1775 Jefferson was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses.
In 1775 he was elected to the Second Continental Congress, and in 1776 he drafted the Declaration of Independence.
Jefferson felt a conflicting devotion to the tranquil pursuits of science and public service. His interests ranged over such fields as agriculture, meteorology, paleontology, ethnology, botany, and medicine.
He believed in the freedom of the scientific mind and the importance of basing conclusions on observations and experiment.
Jefferson demanded utility of science, hence his numerous inventions and interest in improvements and simplifications of agricultural tools and techniques, and in balloons, dry docks, submarines, even the furniture in his home (swivel chairs and music stands).
Because of his prominence as a public figure, he was influential in increasing and improving science education in America.

## Albert Abraham Michelson

Precision measurement in experimental physics was the lifelong passion of A. A. Michelson (1852&endash;1931), who became in 1907 the first American to win a Nobel Prize in one of the sciences.
Born in Prussia but raised in California and Nevada, Michelson attended the U.S. Naval Academy and was teaching there in 1879 when he first improved the methods of measuring the velocity of light on earth.
After a post-graduate education in Europe he returned to the United States where he taught physics at the college that became Case Institute of Technology, then at Clark University, and at the University of Chicago.
While in Europe he invented the famous instrument called the Michelson interferometer and while in Cleveland at Case in 1887, he and E.W. Morley improved this device in an effort to measure the absolute velocity of the Earth as it hurtles through space.
The failure of the Michelson-Morley aether-drift experiment was an important result that showed a deep flaw in 19th-century physics.
Although Michelson remained a creative experimentalist in physical optics, meteorology, astrophysics and spectroscopy throughout his life, he died still believing in the wave model of the nature of light and in his &ldquo;beloved aether.&rdquo;
His experimental valu« of the speed of light, refined still further just before his death, remain the accepted value of one of the few &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; constants in physics for several decades.
