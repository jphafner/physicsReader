We know that an electric current can produce forces on a magnet in its vicinity, or, in other words, an electric current produces a magnetic &ldquo;field.&rdquo;
Faraday had shown, moreover, that a changing magnetic field (produced either by moving a magnet or by varying an electric current in a coil) could induce an electric current in a neighboring, but separate, coil of wire.
Thus, through these fundamental experiments of Oersted, Ampere, and particularly Faraday, various vital facts had been discovered about how electric currents and magnets could interact with one another and, as we have said earlier, these discoveries were already leading to exciting practical developments such as the electric telegraph and the submarine cables.
But, in broad terms, what James Clerk Maxwell tried to do was to build up a more general picture of these interactions between electric and magnetic effects (or &ldquo;fields&rdquo;) without worrying so much about actual coils of wire with electric currents in them, or about how in practice one actually produced the magnetic fields.
Following Faraday&#39;s general lead in concentrating on the &ldquo;lines of force&rdquo; or the &ldquo;fields,&rdquo; Maxwell tried to work out directly and quantitatively the interaction in space of the electric field on the magnetic field, and vice versa, wherever they might exist.
In his mind Maxwell invented, or designed, various semi-mechanical models to build up his theory, but in the end he could discard this mental scaffolding and give a complete mathematical description of electromagnetic behavior which holds good to this day.


Consider the production of a magnetic field by a current of electricity in a coil.
We know that such a current always involves a movement of electric charge, so from the electrical point of view we may say that something is changing all the time.
One of the things Maxwell did was to generalize this discovery boldly, saying in essence: [I] &ldquo;<em>A Changing Electric Field Will Always Produce a Magnetic Field</em>.&rdquo;


But, on the other hand, Faraday had shown that the movement of a magnet could produce an electric current, as we have already seen; so on the same lines this can be generalized to say: [II] &ldquo;<em>A Changing Magnetic Field Can Produce an Electric Field</em>.&rdquo;


The ultimate result of James Clerk Maxwell&#39;s work was, in effect, that he expressed these two basic ideas in precise, quantitative terms, and he came out finally with what are now known as Maxwell&#39;s Equations, which, as I already have said, remain today the standard method of predicting how electricity and magnetism will behave under any given conditions.
The acme of Maxwell&#39;s work, however, was his discovery that when applied in free, empty space his equations took on a form which is equally descriptive of any undamped wave motion propagating itself freely from place to place.
Thus, if you drop a stone into a large pond of water a ripple or wave will proceed out from that place, and some of the energy from the falling stone will radiate outward in the wave from the splash.
If you shout to somebody else some distance away, then it is a vibration or wave in the air around you which carries the sound to the distant person; or if you rig up a long, tight rope or string between two points, and then &ldquo;twang&rdquo; the rope, you can see a wave running along the rope, and this wave carries some of the energy that you put in the &ldquo;twang.&rdquo;
Again, if there is a violent storm at sea, the energy from this storm gets carried over long distances by waves in the ocean; the waves which smash on the rocks of Newfoundland may well be getting their energy from a storm a thousand miles or more out in the Atlantic Ocean.
In each of these latter examples the waves will be damped to some degree or other.
For example, waves traveling on the surface of the sea lose some energy by dragging deeper layers of water, by the very fact that water is not entirely free to move by itself, but has a viscosity or &ldquo;stickiness,&rdquo; which means that the waves ultimately suffer losses by friction.


The particularly remarkable, and unique, feature of <em>electromagnetic</em> waves is the fact that they can propagate themselves quite freely without damping through empty space where no matter whatsoever is present, but it is not difficult to see from the two italicized statements above that a self-propelled wave motion of the electromagnetic field might be possible.

Imagine that we have electric and magnetic fields present in a small region of space, and that the fields are changing suitably with time.
As the electric field changes at some point in space it will produce a magnetic field in the neighborhood, and if things are right this magnetic field will then reinforce the magnetic field in some regions, and in turn the over-all changing magnetic field will produce again a fresh electric field in its neighborhood.
What Maxwell&#39;s equations showed was that this process, perhaps somewhat reminiscent of an endless game of leapfrog, could indeed be self-maintained, with the energy constantly radiating outward from where the waves started.


But this was not all.
Maxwell was able to predict from this theory, moreover, the speed with which such an electromagnetic wave should travel in space.
This speed was simply determined by the ratio of two measurements which could be made on electric and magnetic quantities in the laboratory, and it turned out that the speed predicted in this way was very close to the already known speed of light (about $300,000\,\text{km/sec}\approx 186,000\,\text{miles/sec}$).
Furthermore, it is also a well-known characteristic of light that it too can propagate through empty space, as witness the light of day which reaches us unfailingly from the sun across about a hundred million miles of empty space.
So Maxwell could finally say with confidence that, physically speaking, light must be a form of electromagnetic radiation.


Some years after Maxwell&#39;s death, Heinrich Hertz (1857&endash;94) was able to show experimentally, using electrical apparatus, the direct generation and detection of the electromagnetic waves predicted by Maxwell.
These &ldquo;Hertzian waves&rdquo; are the great-grandfather of the waves which carry all our radio and television broadcasts today, and in fact radio waves, television waves, light waves, X-rays, and gamma rays, are all members of one and the same family&emdash;electromagnetic waves.
In free space they all travel with identically the same speed, which for convenience we always refer to as &ldquo;the velocity of light.&rdquo;
What distinguishes one type of wave from another is simply its rate of vibration, or the corresponding wave length (i.e., the distance between two successive &ldquo;crests&rdquo; or &ldquo;troughs&rdquo; of a wave).
A typical radio wave vibrates at, or has a frequency (<span class="math">f</span>) of, about a million times a second ($f=10^6\,\text{cycles/sec}=1\,\text{M c/s}$), and has a wave length ($\lambda$) of about 300 meters.
For those who do not mind an equation, the relationship is very simple, namely $f\lambda=c$, where <span class="math">c</span> denotes, as always in physical science, the velocity of light.
At the other end of the scale, a gamma ray might have a wave length of only about one ten-billionth part of a centimeter ($\lambda=10^{-10}\,\text{cm}$), and a corresponding frequency of vibration of about three hundred billion billion cycles/sec ($f=3\times 10^{20}\,\text{c/s}$).

## Electromagnetic Waves

Maxwell&#39;s electromagnetic theory also led to intense discussion later about the fundamental nature of the electromagnetic waves involved.
Many physicists felt that in order to have a wave at all there had to be &ldquo;something&rdquo; to do the waving or vibrating, and they invented a sort of all-pervading, universal, thin soup or consomme which they called the &ldquo;aether.&rdquo;
But whether it is more reasonable to talk about electromagnetic waves in free space (which still worries some people for the same sort of reason that &ldquo;action at a distance&rdquo; worried people), or whether it is better to try to think about an all-permeating, vibrating &ldquo;aether&rdquo; is not a very burning issue today.
What matters now is that Maxwell&#39;s Equations are a generally accepted foundation for discussing electromagnetic behavior under the widest range of possible situations, and also that Maxwell&#39;s lead in analyzing electromagnetism by means of the electric and magnetic fields has led more generally to the concept of discussing other forms of interaction through some appropriate &ldquo;field.&rdquo;
Indeed, Maxwell himself was at first very inclined to believe that <em>gravitational</em> attraction must also be propagated in this way, but he ran up against difficulties with the energy involved which seemed to him then insurmountable.


We have seen that, starting from the picture of &ldquo;action at a distance&rdquo; between charges of electricity, Maxwell, following Faraday&#39;s lead, could reformulate the problem in terms of a field acting through, and at all points of, space of which the charged particles are, so to speak, now just the &ldquo;terminals&rdquo; or &ldquo;end points.&rdquo;
The discovery that this electromagnetic field would vibrate in free space was a great step toward identifying light as an electromagnetic wave, since the wave phenomenon of light (interference, diffraction, etc.) had been known for a long time.
At the same time there had always been some persistent reasons for regarding light alternatively as a corpuscular phenomenon, and Einstein was to show, half a century later, that Maxwell&#39;s vibrating electromagnetic aether, when coupled with Planck&#39;s quantum theory first proposed around 1900, could also then be regarded in a more or less corpuscular manner.
What Planck and Einstein showed was that the energy in the electromagnetic field could only exist in certain minimum-sized bundles or &ldquo;quanta&rdquo; dependent in magnitude on the frequency of vibration and the newly discovered Planck&#39;s constant.
These &ldquo;bundles&rdquo; of light, or more technically &ldquo;quanta&rdquo; of the electromagnetic field, are generally known today as photons.
So now we can think of electromagnetic interactions as either conveyed by the vibrating aether or equivalently as conveyed by streams of photons which will to some extent behave like particles.
In dealing with many kinds of interactions, including those which hold an atomic nucleus together, modern physics finds it most valuable to be able to think in both these terms without being bound to regard one picture as more necessarily &ldquo;real&rdquo; than the other.
