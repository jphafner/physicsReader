The electron is the smallest thing in the universe; it would take thirty thousand million, million, million, million of them to make a single ounce.
Yet this utterly invisible, all but weightless object has given us powers over nature of which our ancestors never dreamed.
The electron is our most ubiquitous slave; without its aid, our civilization would collapse in a moment, and humanity would revert to scattered bands ol starving, isolated savages.


We started to use the electron fifty years before we discovered it.
The first practical application of electricity (which is nothing more than the ordered movement of electrons) began with the introduction of the telegraph in the 1840&#39;s.
With really astonishing speed, a copper cobweb of wires and cables spread across the face of the world, and the abolition of distance had begun.
For over a century we have taken the instantaneous transfer of news completely for granted; it is very hard to believe that when Lincoln was born, communications were little faster than in the days of Julius Caesar.


Although the beginning of &ldquo;electronics&rdquo; is usually dated around the 1920&#39;s, this represents a myopic view of technology.
With the hindsight of historical perspective, we can now see that the telegraph and the telephone are the first two landmarks of the electronic age.
After Alexander Graham Bell had sent his voice from one room to another in 1876, society could never be the same again. For the telephone was the first electronic device to enter the home and to affect directly the lives of ordinary men and women, giving them the almost godlike power of projecting their personalities and thoughts from point to point with the speed of lightning.

Until the closing years of the nineteenth century, men used and handled electricity without knowing what it was, but in the 1890&#39;s they began to investigate its fundamental nature, by observing what happened when an electric current was passed through gases at very low pressures.
One of the first, and most dramatic, results of this work was the invention of the X-ray tube, which may be regarded as the ancestor of all the millions of vacuum tubes which followed it.
A cynic might also argue that it is the only electronic device wholly beneficial to mankind&emdash;though when it was invented many terrified spinsters, misunderstanding its powers, denounced poor Rontgen as a violator of privacy.

There is an important lesson to be learned from the X-ray tube.
If a scientist of the late Victorian era had been asked &ldquo;In what way could money best be spent to further the progress of medicine?&rdquo;
he would never by any stretch of the imagination have replied: &ldquo;By encouraging research on the conduction of electricity through rarefied gases.&rdquo;
Yet that is what would have been the right answer, for until the discovery of X rays doctors and surgeons were like blind men, groping in the dark.
One can never predict the outcome of fundamental scientific research, or guess what remote and unexpected fields of knowledge it will illuminate.


X rays were discovered in 1895&emdash;the electron itself just one year later.
It was then realized that an electric current consists of myriads of these submicroscopic particles, each carrying a minute negative charge.
When a current flows through a solid conductor such as a piece of copper wire, we may imagine the electrons creeping like grains of sand through the interstices between the (relatively) boulder-sized copper atoms.
Any individual electron does not move very far, or very fast, but it jostles its neighbor and so the impulse travels down the line at speeds of thousands of miles a second.
Thus when we switch on a light, or send a Morse dash across a transatlantic cable, the response at the other end is virtually instantaneous.


But electrons can also travel without wires to guide them, when they shoot across the empty space of a vacuum tube like a hail of machine-gun bullets.
Under these conditions, no longer entangled in solid matter, they are very sensitive to the pull and tug of electric fields, and as a result can be used to amplify faint signals.
You demonstrate the principle involved every time you hold a hose-pipe in your hand; the slightest movement of your wrist produces a much greater effect at the far end of the jet.
Something rather similar happens to the beam of electrons crossing the space in a vacuum tube; they can thus multiply a millionfold the feeble impulses picked up by a radio antenna, or paint a fluorescent picture on the end of a television screen.


Until 1948, electronics was almost synonymous with the vacuum tube.
The entire development of radio, talkies, radar, television, long-distance telephony, up to that date depended upon little glass bottles containing intricate structures of wire and mica.
By the late logo&#39;s the vacuum tube had shrunk from an object as large as (and sometimes almost as luminous as) an electric light bulb, to a cylinder not much bigger than a man&#39;s thumb.
Then three scientists at the Bell Telephone Laboratories invented the transistor and we moved from the Paleoelectronic to the Neoelectronic Age.


Though the transistor is so small-its heart is a piece of crystal about the size of a rice grain-it does everything that a radio tube can do.
However, it requires only a fraction of the power and space, and is potentially much more reliable.
Indeed, it is hard to see how a properly designed transistor can ever wear out; think of little Vanguard I, still beeping away up there in space, and liable to continue indefinitely until some exasperated astronaut scoops it up with a butterfly net.
The transistor is of such overwhelming importance because it (and its still smaller successors) makes practical hundreds of electronic devices which were previously too bulky, too expensive or too unreliable for everyday use.
The pocket radio is a notorious example; whether we like it or not, it points the way inevitably to a day when person-to-person communication is universal.
Then everyone in the world will have his individual telephone number, perhaps given to him at birth and serving all the other needs of an increasingly complex society (driving license, social security, credit card, permit to have additional children, etc.).
You may not know where on Earth your friend Joe Smith may be at any particular moment; but you will be able to dial him instantly&emdash;if only you can remember whether his number is 8296765043 or 8296756043.


Obviously, there are both advantages and disadvantages in such a &ldquo;personalized&rdquo; communication system; the solitude which we all need at some time in our lives will join the vanished silences of the pre-jet age.
Against this, there is no other way in which a really well-informed and fast-reacting democratic society can be achieved on the original Greek plan&emdash;with direct participation of every citizen in the affairs of the state.
The organization of such a society, with feedback in both directions from the humblest citizen to the President of the World, is a fascinating exercise in political planning.
As usual, it is an exercise that will not be completed by the time we need the answers.


A really efficient and universal communications system, giving high-quality reception on all bands between all points on the Earth, can be achieved only with the aid of satellites.
As they come into general use, providing enormous information-handling capacity on a global basis, today&#39;s patterns of business, education, entertainment, international affairs will change out of all recognition.
Men will be able to meet face to face (individually, or in groups) without ever leaving their homes, by means of closed circuit television.
As a result of this, the enormous amount of commuting and traveling that now takes place from home to office, from ministry to United


Nations, from university to conference hall will steadily decrease.
There are administrators, scientists and businessmen today who spend about a third of their working lives either traveling or preparing to travel.
Much of this is stimulating, but most of it is unnecessary and exhausting.


The improvement of communications will also render obsolete the city&#39;s historic role as a meeting place for minds and a center of social intercourse.
This is just as well anyway, since within another generation most of our cities will be strangled to death by their own traffic.


But though electronics will ultimately separate men from their jobs, so that (thanks to remote manipulation devices) not even a brain surgeon need be within five thousand miles of his patient, it must also be recognized that few of today&#39;s jobs will survive long into the electronic age.
It is now a cliche that we are entering the Second Industrial Revolution, which involves the mechanization not of energy, but of thought.
Like all cliches this is so true that we seldom stop to analyze what it means.


It means nothing less than this: There are no routine, noncreative activities of the human mind which cannot be carried out by suitably designed machines.
The development of computers to supervise industrial processes, commercial transactions and even military operations has demonstrated this beyond doubt.
Yet today&#39;s computers are morons compared to those that they themselves are now helping to design.


I would not care to predict how many of today&#39;s professions will survive a hundred years from now.
What happened to the buggywhip makers, the crossing sweepers, the scriveners, the stonebreakers of yesteryear?
(I mention the last because I can just remember them, hammering away at piles of rock in the country lanes of my childhood.)
Most of our present occupations will follow these into oblivion, as the transistor inherits the earth.


For as computers become smaller, cheaper and more reliable they will move into every field of human activity.
Today they are in the office; tomorrow they will be in the home.
Indeed, some very simple-minded computers already do our household chores; the device that programs a washing machine to perform a certain sequence of operations is a specialized mechanical brain.
Less specialized ones would be able to carry out almost all the routine operations in a suitably designed house.

Because we have so many more pressing problems on our hands, only the science-fiction writers&emdash;those trail-blazers of the future&emdash;have given much thought to the social life of the later electronic age.
How will our descendants be educated for leisure, when the working week is only a few hours?
We have already seen, on a worldwide scale, the cancerous growths resulting from idleness and lack of usable skills.
At every street corner in a great city you will find lounging groups of leather-jacketed, general-purpose bioelectric computers of a performance it will take us centuries and trillions of dollars to match.
What is their future&emdash;and ours?


More than half a century ago H. G. Wells described, in The Time Machine, a world of decadent pleasure lovers, bereft of goals and ambitions, sustained by subterranean machines.
He set his fantasy eight hundred thousand years in the future, but we may reach a similar state of affairs within a dozen generations.
No one who contemplates the rising curve of technology from the Pilgrim fathers to the Apollo Project dare deny that this is not merely possible, but probable.


For most of history, men have been producers; in a very few centuries, they will have to switch to the role of consumers, devoting their energies 100 per cent to absorbing the astronomical output of the automated mines, farms and factories.


Does this really matter, since only a tiny fraction of the human race has ever contributed to artistic creation, scientific discovery or philosophical thought, which in the long run are the only significant activities of mankind?
Archimedes and Aristotle, one cannot help thinking, would still have left their marks on history even if they had lived in a society based on robots instead of human slaves.
In any culture, they would be consumers of goods, but producers of thought.


We should not take too much comfort from this. The electronic computers of today are like the subhuman primates of ten million years ago, who could have given any visiting Martians only the faintest hints of their potentialities, which included the above mentioned Archimedes and Aristotle.
Evolution is swifter now; electronic intelligence is only decades, not millions of years, ahead.


And that&emdash;not transistor radios, automatic homes, global TV&emdash;is the ultimate goal of the Electronic Revolution.
Whether we like it or not, we are on a road where there is no turning back; and waiting at its end are our successors.
