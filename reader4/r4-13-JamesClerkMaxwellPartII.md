In February, 1858, Maxwell wrote a letter to his aunt, Miss Cay, beginning, &ldquo;This comes to tell you that I am going to have a wife.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&#39;t be afraid,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;she is not mathematical, but there are other things besides that, and she certainly won&#39;t stop mathematics.&rdquo;
His engagement to Katherine Mary Dewar, daughter of the principal of Marischal College, was formally announced the same month, and in June they were married. 
Their union became very close: they enjoyed doing things together&emdash;horseback riding, reading aloud to each other, traveling&emdash;and he even found useful tasks for her in his experimental work.
The marriage was childless, but this very fact increased the couple&#39;s dependency and devotion.
Maxwell regarded the marriage tie in an &ldquo;almost mystical manner.&rdquo;
The published letters to his wife overflow with religiosity.
\footnote{
    He did not write in this vein to others and it is a little puzzling why he found it necessary in corresponding with her to quote Scriptures, to express the fervent hope that the Lord would protect her from evil, and that she would get her eyes off &ldquo;things seen and temporal and be refreshed with things eternal.&rdquo;
}

The Aberdeen appointment terminated in 1860 when the two colleges, King&#39;s and Marischal, were fused into a new university and Maxwell&#39;s chair in physics at Marischal was eliminated.
He was not long at liberty.
In the summer of the same year he became professor of natural philosophy at King&#39;s College, London, a post he retained until 1865.
The teaching schedule at King&#39;s was long and arduous; in the evenings there were lectures to be given to &ldquo;artisans&rdquo; as part of his regular duties.
Living in London offered him the opportunity to see something of Faraday, with whom, up to this time, Maxwell had had only correspondence, to make the acquaintance of other scientific men and to renew old friendships.
He was no solitary. &ldquo;Work is good, and reading is good, but friends are better,&rdquo; he wrote to his friend Litchfield.


Yet despite academic duties and social distractions, the five years in London were the most productive of his life.
The paper &ldquo;On the Theory of Three Primary Colors,&rdquo; the two articles in the Philosophical Magazine on &ldquo;Physical Lines of Force&rdquo; and the culminating electrical memoir &ldquo;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field,&rdquo; the Bakerian lecture &ldquo;On the Viscosity or Internal Friction of Air and other Gases,&rdquo; and the celebrated paper &ldquo;On the Dynamical Theory of Gases,&rdquo; all belong to this period.
He also performed important experimental work during these years. At his house in Kensington, in a large garret, he measured the viscosity of gases and obtained practical confirmation of the theoretical work I have described.
(For example, he found that the viscosity of air at 12 millimeters of mercury measured the same as at normal pressure of 760 millimeters, thus proving that viscosity is independent of density.)
To maintain the necessary temperature, a fire had to be kept up in the midst of very hot weather and kettles kept boiling to produce steam, which would be allowed to flow into the room.
Mrs. Maxwell acted as stoker.
Another investigation dealt with the ratio of the electromagnetic to the electrostatic unit of electricity and led to one of Maxwell&#39;s greatest discoveries.
But I must postpone explaining this work, even though to do so means abandoning the strict chronology of events in Maxwell&#39;s life, until I have sketched the development of his ideas on electricity.


To gain an appreciation of Maxwell&#39;s stupendous contribution to this branch of science it is necessary first to describe very briefly the position of electrical theory when he embarked on his studies.


In the eighteenth century, Charles Augustin de Coulomb established the fundamental facts of electrostatic attraction and repulsion.
He showed that an inverse-square law, resembling that of gravitational forces, applied to electric charges: attraction or repulsion between charged bodies is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
\footnote{
    $F = k\frac{qq&#39;}{r^2}$, where <span class="math">F</span> equals the force; <span class="math">k</span>, a constant; <span class="math">q</span> and $q&#39;$, the charges; <span class="math">r</span>, the separating distance.
}
(The same discoveries, and others going beyond them, were made earlier by the brilliant English recluse Henry Cavendish, but his researches remained unpublished until 1879.)
The next major advance was that of Hans Oersted, who in 1819 found that the flow of electric current through a wire parallel to a magnetic needle makes the needle swing to a position at right angles to the current.
In other words, a current produces a magnetic field.


A complementary series of advances was made early in the same century by the French physicist and mathematician Andre Ampere, whom Maxwell called the Newton of electricity.
The accolade was not undeserved, but there is a special reason for Maxwell&#39;s conferring it: Ampere was the first to explain the relationship of electric currents in terms of mechanical action,
\footnote{
    He showed how to calculate the mechanical forces between circuits carrying currents, from an assumed law of force between each pair of elements of the circuit.
}
an approach later perfected by Maxwell himself.
By experiment Ampere learned that a coil of wire carrying an electric current behaves like a magnet, and he suggested that a magnet owes its property to tiny electrical currents inside the steel molecules.
Thus a great conceptual link was forged; for magnetism was shown to be not distinct from electricity, but rather a name we give to some of the effects of moving electric currents.

The crown of these fundamental researches was the immortal work of Michael Faraday.
He found that an electric current flowing in one circuit can cause (&ldquo;induce&rdquo;) a current to flow in another circuit; that there is a magnetic field between two currents; that a current can also be induced to flow in a wire by use of a magnet&emdash;in other words, as a symmetric counterpart to the phenomena discovered by Oersted and Ampere, that changes in a magnetic field produce an electric current.


Faraday&#39;s explanation of these phenomena is of central importance to understanding Maxwell&#39;s work.
He imagined lines of force running through space as the instrumentality of electric and magnetic actions.


These lines, it should be emphasized, were not conceived as mere mathematical makeshifts, but as entities possessing physical properties.
The lines spread out in every direction from an electric charge or magnetic pole; every electric line of force starts from a positive charge and ends on a negative charge; the more powerful the source, the more lines emanate from it.
Along the lines there is tension, a kind of pull, so that each line behaves like an elastic thread trying to shorten itself; lines of force repel each other sideways; the ends of a line of force, representing charges, can move freely over the surface of a conductor but are anchored on an insulator.


This hypothetical system, for which Faraday was convinced he had found experimental evidence, was the starting point of Maxwell&#39;s studies. He believed in it; he sought to develop it.


However, it must not be supposed that everyone accepted Faraday&#39;s hypothesis.
In fact, the majority of electricians&emdash;I use the term in its older sense&emdash;regarded lines of force as a concept much inferior to that of &ldquo;action at a distance.&rdquo;
They likened electricity to gravitation.
They imagined a charge (or mass) situated at one point in space mysteriously influencing a charge (or mass) at another point, with no linkage or connection of any kind, however tenuous, bridging the distance between the charges (or masses).
Where Faraday sought to assimilate the behavior of electricity to that of a mechanical system, in which all parts are joined by levers, pulleys, ropes and so on, the others held electricity to be a special case, to which mechanical analogies were inapplicable.
Maxwell admirably summarized the cleavage between the two views: &ldquo;Faraday, in his mind&#39;s eye, saw lines of force traversing all space, where the mathematicians saw centres of force attracting at a distance; Faraday saw a medium where they saw nothing but distance; Faraday sought the seat of the phenomena in real actions going on in the medium, they were satisfied that they had found it in a power of action at a distance impressed on the electric fluids.&rdquo;


Maxwell&#39;s first electrical paper &ldquo;On Faraday&#39;s Lines of Force&rdquo; was delivered at Cambridge in 1855, within a few months after he had finished reading Faraday&#39;s Experimental Researches.
What he tried to do was imagine a physical model embodying Faraday&#39;s lines, whose behavior, like that of any machine, could be reduced to formulae and numbers.
He did not suggest that the model represented the actual state of things; on the other hand, he had no confidence in what mathematical manipulations alone would reveal about the actual state of things.
It was important, he said, so to balance the method of investigation that the mind at every step is permitted &ldquo;to lay hold of a clear physical conception, without being committed to any theory founded on the physical science from which that conception is borrowed.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    The opening paragraph of the paper is worth giving in full.
    &ldquo;The present state of electrical science seems peculiarly unfavorable to speculation.
    The laws of the distribution of electricity on the surface of conductors have been analytically deduced from experiment; some parts of the mathematical theory of magnetism are established, while in other parts the experimental data are wanting; the theory of the conduction of galvanism and that of the mutual attraction of conductors have been reduced to mathematical formulae, but have not fallen into relation with the other parts of the science.
    No electrical theory can now be put forth, unless it shows the connection not only between electricity at rest and current electricity, but between the attractions and inductive effects of electricity in both states. Such a theory must accurately satisfy those laws the mathematical form of which is known, and must afford the means of calculating the effects in the limiting cases where the known formulae are inapplicable.
    In order therefore to appreciate the requirements of the science, the student must make himself familiar with a considerable body of most intricate mathematics, the mere attention of which in the memory materially interferes with further progress.
    The first process therefore in the effectual study of the science, must be one of simplification and reduction of the results of previous investigation to a form in which the mind can grasp them.
    The results of this simplification may take the form of a purely mathematical formula or of a physical hypothesis.
    In the first case we entirely lose sight of the phenomena to be explained; and though we may trace out the consequences of given laws, we can never obtain more extended views of the connections of the subject.
    If, on the other hand, we adopt a physical hypothesis, we see the phenomena only through a medium, and are liable to that blindness to facts and rashness in assumption which a partial explanation encourages.
    We must therefore discover some method of investigation which allows the mind at every step to lay hold of a clear physical conception, without being committed to any theory founded on the physical science from which that conception is borrowed, so that it is neither drawn aside from the subject in pursuit of analytical subtleties, nor carried beyond the truth by a favorite hypothesis.
    In order to obtain physical ideas without adopting a physical theory we must make ourselves familiar with the existence of physical analogies.
    By a physical analogy I mean that partial similarity between the laws of one science and those of another which makes each of them illustrate the other.
    Thus all the mathematical sciences are founded on relations between physical laws and laws of numbers, so that the aim of exact science is to reduce the problems of nature to the determination of quantities by operations with numbers.&rdquo;
}
Such a method will neither lead into a blind alley of abstractions, nor permit the investigator to be &ldquo;carried beyond the truth by a favorite hypothesis.&rdquo;


Analogies are, of course, the lifeblood of scientific speculation.
Maxwell gives a number of examples, among them the illuminating suggestion of William Thomson comparing the formulae of the motion of heat with those of attractions (such as gravitation and electricity) varying inversely as the square of the distance.
To be sure, the quantities entering into heat formulae&emdash;temperature, flow of heat, conductivity&emdash;are distinct from a quantity such as force entering into the formulae of inverse-square attraction.
Yet the mathematical laws of both classes of phenomena are identical in form.
&ldquo;We have only to substitute source of heat for center of attraction, flow of heat for accelerating effect of attraction at any point, and temperature for potential, and the solution of a problem in attractions is transformed into that of a problem of heat.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    &ldquo;On Faraday&#39;s Lines of Force,&rdquo; Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, vol. X, part I, included in <em>The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell</em>, op. cit.
}

Maxwell proposed a hydrodynamical analogy to bring before the mind in &ldquo;convenient and manageable form those mathematical ideas which are necessary to the study of the phenomenon of electricity.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    Ibid.
}
The analogy was combined with Faraday&#39;s lines of force, so that they were converted from lines into &ldquo;tubes of flow&rdquo; carrying an incompressible fluid such as water.
He was then able to show that the steady flow of particles of this fluid would give rise to tensions and pressures corresponding to electrical effects.
The fluid moving through a system of such tubes represented electricity in motion; the form and diameter of the tubes gave information as to strength and direction of fluid (electric) flow.
The velocity of the fluid was the equivalent of electrical force; differences of fluid pressure were analogous to differences of electrical pressure or potential.
Since the tubes were flexible and elastic, and arranged so as to form surfaces&emdash;each tube being in contact with its neighbors&emdash;pressure transmitted from tube to tube furnished an analogy to electrical induction.


One of Faraday&#39;s key concepts deals with the effect on space of lines of magnetic force.
A wire introduced into ordinary space remains inert; but if magnetic lines of force are introduced into the space, a current flows through the wire.
Faraday explained this by saying that the introduction of the magnet threw the space into an &ldquo;electro-tonic state.&rdquo;
This concept could not be fitted into the hydrodynamical analogy; Maxwell admitted that while he could handle Faraday&#39;s conjecture mathematically, the electro-tonic state at any point of space being defined &ldquo;as a quantity determinate in magnitude and direction,&rdquo; his representation involved no physical theory&emdash;&ldquo;it is only a kind of artificial notation.&rdquo;
\footnote{

    &ldquo;Maxwell on the Method of Physical Analogy,&rdquo; <em>The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</em>, vol. VI, no. 23, November, 1955.
}

It was a wonderful paper, and Faraday, to whom Maxwell sent a copy, appreciated how much it advanced the &ldquo;interests of philosophical truth.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I was at first almost frightened,&rdquo; he wrote Maxwell, &ldquo;when I saw such mathematical force made to bear upon the subject, and then wondered to see that the subject stood it so well.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    Campbell and Garnett, op. cit., p. 519.
}
Other students, however, thought the subject stood it not at all well.
Electricity was mysterious enough without adding tubes and surfaces and incompressible fluids.
But Maxwell, who had good training in being considered queer, went on with the task of extending Faraday&#39;s ideas.

The second great memoir, On Physical Lines of Force, a series of three papers published in the Philosophical Magazine in 1861 and 1862, was an attempt to describe a more elaborate mechanism that would not only account for electrostatic effects but also explain magnetic attraction and Faraday&#39;s concept of electromagnetic induction.
Again, Maxwell used a concrete, mechanical image to exhibit and develop his theory.
\footnote{
    As Turner top. cit.) points out. Maxwell employed two analogies.
    One bridged a stationary field and a solid under stress.
    The other is between electricity and fluid motion, &ldquo;with its suggestion that Ampere&#39;s laws be modified to satisfy the equation of continuity.&rdquo;
}
For, as he said, &ldquo;scientific truth should be regarded as equally scientific whether it appears in the robust form and vivid colouring of a physical illustration or in the tenuity and paleness of a symbolic expression.&rdquo;


In the new model a magnetic field is produced by the rotation in space of what Maxwell called &ldquo;molecular vortices.&rdquo;
These may be thought of as slender cylinders (Maxwell himself had a disconcerting way of modifying the image as he went along) that rotate round the lines of magnetic force.
The lines, traced by the pattern of iron filings about a magnet, are the axes of rotation of the cylinders; the velocity of rotation depends on the intensity of the magnetic force.
Two mechanical effects are associated with the cylinders: tension in the direction of the lines of force, and pressure, exerted in the &ldquo;equatorial&rdquo; direction (i.e., lateral pressure), arising from the centrifugal force produced by the rotating cylinders.
Combined, these effects mechanically reproduce magnetic phenomena: magnetism is a force exerted both along the axis and outward from the axis.


It may now be asked how this curious arrangement fitted in with the known facts that an electric current produces a magnetic field, and changing magnetic forces produce an electric current.
Step by step Maxwell answers this question.

<figure>

    In this illustration the vortices are slender cylinders seen from the end.
    (Maxwell gave the cylinders a hexagonal cross section to simplify the geometry of the model.)
    Between the vortices are small &ldquo;idle wheels.&rdquo; If a row of the idle wheels is moved from <span class="math">A</span> toward <span class="math">B</span>, they cause the adjacent vortices to rotate in the opposite direction.

</figure>

The first point to clarify is the structure of a uniform magnetic field.
Maxwell supposed this to consist of a portion of space filled with cylinders rotating at the same velocity and in the same direction &ldquo;about axes nearly parallel.&rdquo;
But immediately a puzzle confronted him. Since the cylinders are in contact, how can they possibly rotate in the same direction?
For as everyone knows, a revolving wheel or cylinder causes its neighbor to revolve in the opposite direction; thus one would expect the rotation of the cylinders to alternate in direction from one to the next.
Maxwell hit upon a pretty idea.
He supposed the cylinders to be separated by rows of small spheres, like layers of ball bearings, which acted as gears (in Maxwell&#39;s words, &ldquo;idle wheels&rdquo;).
This arrangement, resembling a device envisaged a century earlier by John Bernoulli, the younger, fulfilled the requirement.
The spheres rotate in an opposite sense to that of each of the cylinders with which they are in contact, and so the cylinders all rotate in the same direction.


And now, as just reward for his ingenuity, Maxwell found that the spheres could be made to serve another, even more valuable, purpose.
Think of them as particles of electricity.
Then by purely mechanical reasoning it can be shown that their motions in the machine of which they are a part serve to explain many electrical phenomena.


Consider these examples.
In an unchanging magnetic field the cylinders all rotate at the same constant rate; thus they maintain a constant magnetic field.
The little rotating spheres keep their position; there is no flow of particles, hence no electric current, a result that tallies with the properties of a uniform magnetic field.
Now suppose a change in the magnetic force.
This means a change in the velocity of rotation of the cylinders.
As each cylinder is speeded up, it transmits the change in velocity to its neighbors.
But since a cylinder now rotates at a slightly different speed from its neighbor, the spheres between them are torn from their positions by a kind of shearing action.
In other words, they begin to move from their centers of rotation, in addition to rotating.
This motion of translation is an electric current; again, a result that tallies with the properties of a changing magnetic field.


Observe now how the model begins to live a life of its own.
It was designed, as J. J. Thomson has pointed out,
\footnote{
    Sir J. J. Thompson, &ldquo;James Clerk Maxwell.&rdquo; in <em>James Clerk Maxwell, A Commemoration Volume</em>, op. cit.
}
to exhibit Faraday&#39;s great discovery that magnetic changes produce electric currents.
It suggested to Maxwell the no less striking converse phenomenon that changes in electric force might produce magnetism.
\footnote{
    Ampere, of course, had already demonstrated that currents in wires produced accompanying magnetic fields.
}
Assume the spheres and cylinders are at rest.
If a force is applied to the spheres of electricity, they begin to rotate, causing the cylinders of magnetism with which they are in contact to rotate in the opposite direction.
The rotation of the cylinders indicates a magnetic force.
Moreover, the model holds up even as to details.
Take a single illustration.
Magnetism acts at right angles to the direction of flow of current.
If you will examine the diagram of Maxwell&#39;s model, you will see that the cylinders will rotate in the direction perpendicular to the motion of the spheres, thus bearing out the observation that a magnetic force acts at right angles to the flow of a current.


&ldquo;I do not bring it forward,&rdquo; Maxwell wrote of his system, &ldquo;as a mode of connection existing in Nature &hellip; It is, however, a mode of connection which is mechanically conceivable and easily investigated, and it serves to bring out the actual mechanical connection between the known electromagnetic phenomena.
\footnote{
    &ldquo;On Physical Lines of Force,&rdquo; op. cit.
}
Certain aspects of these &ldquo;mechanical connections&rdquo; have already been discussed&emdash;rotations, pressures, tensions&emdash;which account for the reciprocal relations between currents and magnetic forces.
\footnote{
    The model explained, for example, why a current of electricity generated heat: for as the particles (or spheres) move from one cylinder to another, &ldquo;they experience resistance, and generate irregular motions, which constitute heat.&rdquo;
}
The connections also serve to explain the repulsion between two parallel wires carrying currents in opposite directions, an effect produced by the centrifugal pressures of the revolving cylinders acting on the electrical particles between them.
The induction of currents is similarly elucidated: this phenomenon, says Maxwell, is simply &ldquo;part of the process of communicating the rotary velocity of the vortices [cylinders] from one part of the field to another.&rdquo;
In other words, whenever electricity (Maxwell&#39;s particles) &ldquo;yields to an electromotive force,&rdquo; induced currents result.
His diagram and the accompanying text make this beautifully clear.

Maxwell was not done with his model.
It had helped in the interpretation of magnetism, the behavior of electric currents, the phenomenon of induction; it had yet to pass the supreme test: that is, to supply a mechanical explanation of the origin of electromagnetic waves.
To orient ourselves in this matter we must examine briefly the question of condensers and insulators.

An electric condenser is a device for storing electricity.
In its simplest form it consists of two conducting plates separated by an insulating material, or dielectric as it is called.
The plates can be charged, after which the charges attract each other through the dielectric and are thus said to be &ldquo;bound&rdquo; in place.
Faraday in his experiments had come upon a curious fact.
He found that two condensers of the same size, fed by the same electric source and with insulation of equal thickness, differed markedly in their capacity to take or to hold a charge if the insulating material (dielectric) was different.
This was difficult to understand if all dielectrics were equally impermeable to an electric current.
Moreover, if it were true, as Maxwell already was beginning to suspect, that light itself is an electrical phenomenon, how could light pass through certain dielectrics, empty space among them? With the help of his model, Maxwell advanced a bold hypothesis.
Conductors, he said, pass a current when the electrical particles they contain are acted upon by an electric force.
Under such an impulsion, the little particles move more or less freely from cylinder to cylinder, and the current flows as long as the force persists.
Not so in a dielectric.
The particles are present but an easy passage from cylinder to cylinder is impossible.
This fact maybe taken as the characteristic attribute of a dielectric, having to do with its physical structure. Yet it was known that &ldquo;localized electric phenomena do occur in dielectrics.&rdquo;
Maxwell suggested that these phenomena also are currents&emdash;but of a special kind.
When an electric force acts on a dielectric, the particles of electricity are &ldquo;displaced,&rdquo; but not entirely torn loose; that is, they behave like a ship riding at anchor in a storm.
The medium in which they are located, the magnetic cylinders, is elastic ; under pressure the particles move, a limited distance, until the force pushing them is balanced by the stresses due to the elastic reaction of the medium.
Thus a state of equilibrium is attained.
But as soon as the impelling force ceases to act, the particles snap back to their original positions.
The net effect of these mechanical actions is twofold.
First, the initial displacement of the electric particles constitutes a current that passes through the dielectric.
A current of this type is called a displacement current to distinguish it from currents that flow through conductors and are therefore known as conduction currents.
\footnote{
    The contrast between displacement currents and currents through conductors was vividly expressed by Henri Poincar&eacute;.
    A displacement current, he said, is an elastic reaction like the compression of a spring: it can only be effected by pressure against resistance.
    Equilibrium is reached when resistance balances pressure.
    When the pressure is removed the spring regains its original form.
    A conduction current, on the other hand, is like a viscous reaction such as is encountered in moving a body immersed in water.
    It can be effected only by pressure; the resistance depends on velocity; the motion continues as long as the motive force acts, and equilibrium will never be established.
    &ldquo;The body does not return to the starting point, and the energy expended in moving it cannot be restored, having been completely transformed into heat through the viscosity of the water.&rdquo;
    (<em>Maxwell&#39;s Theory and Wireless Telegraphy</em>, New York, 1904.)
}
Wherever there is an electric force, said Maxwell, there is displacement; wherever there is displacement, there is a current.

Second, whenever the pressure displacing the particles is released, and they snap back, they overshoot and oscillate briefly about their fixed positions.
The oscillation is transmitted through the magnetic medium (the insulator) as a wave.
This wave is the return phase of the displacement current.
\footnote{
    If the electric force applied to the insulator is varied continually, it will produce a continually varying displacement wave: in other words, a continuing current.
}
(Max- well suggested this disturbance on analogy to the displacement of an elastic solid under stress.)


Maxwell next arrived at an epoch-making conclusion.
The velocity of the displacement wave, or current, depends on the electrical properties of the medium in which it moves.
Moreover, this velocity, as he showed, was &ldquo;within the limits of experimental error, the same as that of light.&rdquo;
Hence, he inferred, &ldquo;the elasticity of the magnetic medium in air is the same as that of the luminiferous medium, if these two coexistent, coextensive and equally elastic media are not rather one medium.&rdquo;

More must be said as to how Maxwell actually arrived at this conclusion.
In the 1850s the German physicists Wilhelm Weber and Friedrich Kohlrausch had investigated an important relationship, namely, the ratios of electrostatic to electrodynamic action.
The electrostatic unit of charge was defined as the repulsion between two (like) unit charges at unit distance apart.
The electrodynamic unit was defined as the repulsion between two definite lengths of wire carrying currents &ldquo;which may be specified by the amount of charge which travels past any point in unit time.&rdquo;
In order to compare the repulsion between static charges with that between moving charges, a factor of proportionality must be introduced, since the units are different for static and dynamic phenomena.
That is, one must determine how many positive units of electricity flowing in one wire, and negative units flowing in the other, are required to produce between the wires a repulsion quantitatively equal to that between two static units.
The factor turns out to be a velocity; for since the length of the wires is fixed, and the number of units of electricity passing a given point in a given time can be measured, what the investigator must consider is the dimension length divided by time or velocity.
Weber and Kohlrausch had found that the velocity of propagation of an electric disturbance along a perfectly conducting wire is close to $3\times 10^{10}$ cm/sec.
This was an astonishing coincidence, for the figure was about the same as the velocity of light as it had been determined a few years earlier by the French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau.


Kirchhoff remarked the coincidence, but did not pursue it; Maxwell did.
In 1860 he attacked the problem experimentally, using an ingenious torsion balance to compare the repulsion between two static charges and two wires carrying currents.
The Weber-Kohlrausch results were roughly confirmed.
Also, at about the same time (he said, in fact, that the pencil and paper work was done before seeing Weber&#39;s memoir), he calculated the velocity of displacement currents in empty space or in any other dielectric.
The resulting values tallied closely.
In other words, currents in a wire, displacement currents in a dielectric, and light in empty space (which of course is a dielectric) all traveled with the same velocity.
With this evidence at hand, which he communicated in a letter to Faraday in 1861, Maxwell did not hesitate to assert the identity of the two phenomena&emdash;electrical disturbances and light.
&ldquo;We can scarcely avoid the inference,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.&rdquo;


&ldquo;On Physical Lines of Force,&rdquo; despite its cogwheels and other gross mechanical adjuncts, may be regarded as the most brilliant of Maxwell&#39;s electrical papers.
If it did not claim to give a picture of the true state of things, it was at least enormously enlightening as to how electricity and magnetism could interact in a purely mechanical relationship.
Maxwell himself summarized the achievements of the theory as follows.
It explained magnetic forces as the effect of the centrifugal force of the cylinders; induction as the effect of the forces called into play when there is a change of angular velocity of the cylinders; electromotive force as an effect produced by stress on the connecting mechanism; electric displacement as a result of the elastic yielding of the mechanism; electromagnetic waves as an accompaniment of displacement.
The paper is one of the rare examples of scientific literature in which one may glimpse the play of imagination, the actual exercise of inductive power, the cultivation of nascent ideas.


None of the basic concepts unfolded in this memoir was discarded in the more mathematical writings that followed.
But Maxwell now had to outgrow his model.
In &ldquo;A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field,&rdquo; published in 1864,
\footnote{
    <em>Royal Society Transactions</em>, vol. CLV.
}
Maxwell, in Sir Edmund Whittaker&#39;s words, displayed the architecture of his system &ldquo;stripped of the scaffolding by aid of which it had first been erected.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    <em>History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity: The Classical Theories</em>, London, 1951.
}
The particles and cylinders are gone; in their place is the field&emdash;&ldquo;the space in the neighborhood of the electric or magnetic bodies&rdquo;&emdash;and the aether, a special kind of &ldquo;matter in motion by which the observed electromagnetic phenomena are produced.&rdquo;
The matter composing the aether has marvelous properties.
It is very fine and capable of permeating bodies; it fills space, is elastic and is the vehicle of &ldquo;the undulations of light and heat.&rdquo;
Yet for all its refinements and subtleties, the medium is no less a mechanical rig than the cylinders and spheres of its predecessor.
It can move, transmit motions, undergo elastic deformations, store potential (mechanical) energy and release it when the deforming pressures are removed.
Though susceptible to the action of electric currents and magnets, it is nonetheless a mechanism that, as Maxwell said, &ldquo;must be subject to the general laws of Dynamics, and we ought to be able to work out all the consequences of its motion, provided we know the form of the relation between the motions of the parts.&rdquo;
In the preceding paper Maxwell already had devised a set of equations that described the possible mechanical basis of electrical and magnetic phenomena, and, in particular, how certain changes in electric and magnetic forces could produce electrical waves.
He now elaborated the hypothesis of displacement currents and obtained the expressions that are in substance the famous Maxwellian equations of the electromagnetic field.


In their most finished form the equations appear in the Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1873), the culmination of Maxwell&#39;s researches, which he wrote at Glenlair in the years following his resignation from King&#39;s College.
This celebrated work deals with every branch of electric and magnetic science and presents the results of twenty years of thought and experiment.
Maxwell remained faithful to Faraday, whose point of view is emphasized throughout the Treatise.
Characterizing his own part as that of an &ldquo;advocate,&rdquo; Maxwell makes no attempt to describe the hypotheses propounded by Weber, Gauss, Riemann, Carl and Franz Neumann, or Ludwig Lorenz, the foremost cultivators of the theory of action at a distance.


The task Maxwell set himself was, first, to formulate mathematically electromagnetic phenomena as observed experimentally, and, second, to show that these mathematical relationships could be deduced from the fundamental science of dynamics; or to put it another way, that the laws of electricity in motion could be derived from the laws applicable to any system of moving bodies.
As always, Maxwell was very cautious in expressing himself about the nature of electricity. 
It behaves, he said, like an incompressible fluid; &ldquo;wherever there is electric force there is electric displacement.&rdquo;
These, as J. J. Thomson observed, are the only definite statements about electricity to be found in the treatise, which led Hertz to say that Maxwell&#39;s theory is Maxwell&#39;s equations, and caused Helmholtz to comment that &ldquo;he would be puzzled to explain what an electric charge was on Maxwell&#39;s theory beyond being the recipient of a symbol.&rdquo;


What are the Maxwellian equations?
I cannot hope to give an easy answer to this question, but at the cost of deliberate oversimplification I must try summarily to explain them, for they are the heart of the theory.


Maxwell based the equations on four principles:
    (1) that an electric force acting on a conductor produces a current proportional to the force;
    (2) that an electric force acting on a dielectric produces displacement proportional to the force;
    (3) that a current produces a magnetic force (i.e., a moving electric charge is surrounded by a magnetic field) at right angles to the current&#39;s lines of flow and proportional to its intensity;
    (4) that a changing magnetic force (or field) produces a current proportional to the intensity of the force.
The third and fourth principles exhibit a striking symmetry.
The third is Faraday&#39;s law of electromagnetic induction, according to which &ldquo;the rate of alteration in the number of lines of magnetic induction passing through a circuit is equal to the work done in taking unit electric charge round the circuit.&rdquo;
Maxwell&#39;s complementary law, the fourth principle, is that &ldquo;the rate of alteration in the number of lines of electric force passing through a circuit is equal to the work done in taking a unit magnetic pole round it.&rdquo;

On this foundation two sets of symmetrical equations can be
erected. One set expresses the continuous nature of electric
and magnetic fields; the second set tells how changes in one
field produce changes in the other. In these formulations the
mechanical aspects of the theory are retained, perfect conti-
nuity is preserved by treating electricity as if it were an in-
compressible fluid, and wave phenomena are deduced as the
consequences of displacement in a dielectric.

How does the concept of the field enter the theory?
We have followed Maxwell as he stripped his model of its particles and cylinders and reduced it to an aetherial medium.
In the <em>Treatise</em>, while not abandoning the medium altogether, he robs it of almost all its attributes other than form.
The matter of the medium, as Poincar&eacute; says, is left only with purely geometric properties, the atoms dwindle to mathematical points, subject to the laws of dynamics alone.
The grin is left but the cat is gone.
It is a perfect example of mathematical abstraction.
\footnote{
    Einstein made an interesting comment about Maxwell&#39;s equations and his use of the concept of the field.
    &ldquo;He showed that the whole of what was then known about light and electromagnetic phenomena was expressed in his well-known double system of differential equations, in which the electric and the magnetic fields appear as the dependent variables.
    Maxwell did, indeed, try to explain, or justify, these equations by intellectual constructions.
    But he made use of several such constructions at the same time and took none of them really seriously, so that the equations alone appeared as the essential thing and the strength of the fields as the ultimate entities, not to be reduced to anything else.
    By the turn of the century the conception of the electromagnetic field as an ultimate entity had been generally accepted and serious thinkers had abandoned the belief in the justification, or the possibility, of a mechanical explanation of Clerk Maxwell&#39;s equations.
    Before long they were, on the contrary, actually trying to explain material points and their inertia on field theory lines with the help of Maxwell&#39;s theory, an attempt which did not, however, meet with complete success.
    Neglecting the important individual results which Clerk Maxwell&#39;s life work produced in important departments of physics, and concentrating on the changes wrought by him in our conception of the nature of physical reality, we may say this:&emdash;before Clerk Maxwell people conceived of physical reality&emdash;insofar as it is supposed to represent events in nature&emdash;as material points, whose changes consist exclusively of motions, which are subject to partial differential equations.
    After Maxwell they conceived physical reality as represented by continuous fields, not mechanically explicable, which are subject to partial differential equations.
    This change in the conception of reality is the most profound and fruitful one that has come to physics since Newton; but it has at the same time to be admitted that the program has by no means been completely carried out yet.&rdquo;

    I am puzzled as to what Einstein meant in saying that Maxwell&#39;s equation eliminated the notion of mechanism in explaining electromagnetic phenomena. 
    Similar views have been expressed by many other physicists and philosophers.
    Maxwell himself would not have agreed with this position.
    His writings refute it.
    The inference was drawn by his successors.
    But there is a more important point that requires clarification; namely, do the equations justify the inference?
    It is true that a field is not the same as a material particle, and that the motion of a particle is not the same as a change in a field.
    It is true also that the concept &ldquo;material particle&rdquo; was long held to he intuitively clear, while the concept &ldquo;field&rdquo; has never heen so regarded.
    This makes it easier to say mysterious things about fields, which no one would dream of saying about particles.
    But a more careful definition of these concepts, as physicists actually use them, raises serious question as to whether a field is any less suited to a &ldquo;mechanistic&rdquo; explanation than a system of material particles; indeed, whether a mechanistic explanation fits either or neither case.
    In modern physics material particles are not what they once were.
    They are pale abstractions, quite incapable of anything so robust as a collision.
    But then what is a collision?
    One thinks of billiard balls knocking together, as a pristine example.
    This, however, is a plain man&#39;s way of thinking.
    The modern physicist has rid his mind of such seductive images.
    (As far back as the eighteenth century, the Italian physicist Boscovich proposed the idea that the heart of an atom is not solid substance but a mere center of immaterial force.)
    As particles fade, the field becomes more substantial.
    Properties are now ascribed to it that make it seem more real and more potent than a billiard ball or a boulder. Of course the field is hard to describe in homely terms.
    Yet it is quite capable, as physicists tell us, of doing homely things.
    It produces and undergoes changes&emdash;now as if it were a cloud, now an engine, now an ocean. In short it has mechanical effects.
    By this I mean effects of a kind produced by what used to be called material particles.
    Moreover, it has mechanical properties.
    By this I mean properties of a kind produced by what we call a machine.
    The field can do things no system of particles or machine yet conceived can do.
    Since it can also do all they can do, it is a supermachine.
    Is there any point in saving the name?
    I think there is, to keep our thinking straight.
    We ought to keep it to describe both fields and particles or we ought to discard it entirely.
    If the word &ldquo;mechanism&rdquo; has any meaning in the universe of refined observation, it has as much meaning in relation to fields as to particles.
    At the same time I am quite prepared to believe that it has as little meaning in one case as the other; for that matter, no meaning in either.
}

The aether is a thing that wiggles when it is prodded, but does nothing on its own.
An electromagnetic field consists of two kinds of energy, electrostatic or potential energy, and electrodynamic or kinetic energy.
The aether, like a universal condenser, may be conceived as storing energy&emdash;in which case, being elastic, it is deformed.
Since the aether fills all space and therefore penetrates conductors as well as dielectrics, it no longer makes any difference whether we deal with a conduction current or a displacement current; in either case the aether is set in motion.
This motion is communicated mechanically from one part of the medium to the next and is apprehended by us as heat, or light, or mechanical force (as in the repulsion between wires) or other phenomena of magnetism and electricity.
The ruling principle of all such phenomena, it should be observed, is that of least action.
This is the grand overriding law of the parsimony of nature: every action within a system is executed with the least possible expenditure of energy.
It was of the first importance to Maxwell that electrical phenomena should satisfy the principle, for otherwise his mechanical explanation of the phenomena would not have been possible.


With these points in mind, we may examine a set of Maxwell&#39;s equations in a form that describes the behavior of an electromagnetic field under the most general conditions, i.e., a field moving in empty space.
No conductors are present, no free charges, and the medium is a vacuum.
The equations then read

\begin{align*}
    1)& div \mathbf{E} = 0 \\
    2)& div \mathbf{H} = 0 \\
    3)& curl \mathbf{E} = -\frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial H}{\partial t} \\
    3)& curl \mathbf{H} = \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
\end{align*}

The meaning of the symbols is as follows: <span class="math">E</span> and <span class="math">H</span> represent electric and magnetic field strength; since they vary in time, and from place to place, they are functions of the space coordinates <span class="math">x</span>, <span class="math">y</span>, <span class="math">z</span> (not shown) and of the time coordinate, <span class="math">t</span>.
<span class="math">C</span> is the velocity of light and enters the equations as the rate of propagation; <span class="math">div</span> (an abbreviation for divergence) and $curl$ (an abbreviation for rotation) represent mathematical operations whose physical meaning is explained below.

Divergence is essentially a measure of rate of change.
In words, then, equation 1
\begin{equation*}
    div E = 0
\end{equation*}

says that in a moving field the electric intensity is the same at every point, i.e., the rate of change is zero at every point.
More loosely, this equation extends to the field the classical principle that electric lines of force can be neither created nor destroyed.
Thus the equation says that the number of electric lines of force, representing the field strength, that enter any tiny volume of space must equal the number leaving it.
Making use of still another analogy, if one conceives of electricity in Maxwell&#39;s idiom, as an incompressible fluid, equation 1 states that as much fluid flows out of a tiny volume of space in a given time as flows in.
\footnote{
    For the reader interested in a little more detail, the following explanation may be helpful.
    Equation 1 states that the divergence of the electric field intensity is zero at any point in space and at any instant of time.
    The meaning of the equation may be visualized as follows.
    It is customary to represent <span class="math">E</span> at a given instant of time by a series of lines whose relative density in space is proportional to <span class="math">E</span>.
    These lines have direction because <span class="math">E</span> is a vector.
    Consider a point <span class="math">P</span> and a sphere surrounding <span class="math">P</span>.
    Let us suppose that the intensity of the electric field on the left hemispherical surface of the sphere is uniform over the surface and is directed at each point perpendicular to the surface.

    Suppose further that some change takes place in the electric field intensity <span class="math">E</span> in the region occupied by the sphere but such that on the right hemispherical surface the field <span class="math">E</span> is again uniform and perpendicular to the surface but stronger than on the left portion.
    We would indicate this increase in the intensity of <span class="math">E</span> by having more lines leave the sphere on the right than enter on the left.
    Using the number of lines as a measure of <span class="math">E</span>, we count the lines entering the spherical surface and multiply this number by the area of the hemisphere, and regard this product as negative.
    Let us next form the analogous product of the area and the number of lines leaving the surface, and regard this product as positive.
    The algebraic sum of these two products, that is, the positive plus the negative, is called the net electric flux through the spherical surface.
    This net flux is the divergence of <span class="math">E</span> over the volume of the sphere.
    In our illustration the net flux of <span class="math">E</span> has increased as <span class="math">E</span> passes through the sphere.
    Hence we should say in this case that the divergence of <span class="math">E</span> through the sphere is positive.
    If we now divide this net flux through the sphere by the volume of the sphere, we obtain the next net flux per unit volume.
    We now imagine that the sphere becomes smaller and smaller and contracts to the point <span class="math">P</span>.
    Of course the net flux per unit volume changes and approaches some limiting value.
    This limiting value, which is a mathematical abstraction, is div <span class="math">E</span> at the point <span class="math">P</span>.
    Thus div <span class="math">E</span> is essentially a measure of the spatial rate of change of <span class="math">E</span> at the point <span class="math">P</span>.
    Since equation 1 says that for electric fields $div E = 0$ at each point <span class="math">P</span>, we may say that the net spatial rate of change of <span class="math">E</span> is zero in empty space.
    More loosely stated, this equation says that electric field lines are neither created nor destroyed at the point P. It is to be noted that the phrase &ldquo;spatial rate of change&rdquo; is intended to emphasize that the divergence is concerned with the way in which <span class="math">E</span> changes from point to point in space at the same instant of time.
    This spatial rate must be distinguished from the rate at which some quantity, for example, <span class="math">E</span> itself in equation 4, may change during some interval of time.
}

Equation 2
\begin{equation*}
    div H =  0
\end{equation*}


makes the same assertion for magnetic lines as equation 1 makes for electric lines.
Equation 3

\begin{equation*}
    curl E = \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial H}{\partial t}
\end{equation*}


is Maxwell&#39;s way of stating Faraday&#39;s law of induction.
The equation describes what happens in a changing magnetic field.

The right side expresses rate of change, $\frac{\partial H}{\partial t}$, multiplied by a very small factor, (the negative sign before the fraction is purely a matter of algebraic convenience); the left side expresses the fact that an electric field is created by a changing magnetic field.
But the equation is more than analytic; thanks to the sign curl, it actually gives a picture of the event.
A simple diagram may help make this clear.
Suppose the existence of a magnetic field uniform over a region of space.
We draw a circle
<figure>
</figure>
surrounding a bundle of parallel lines, which represent the intensity and direction of the magnetic field.
The circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the lines.
If the field is changed (by motion or by increase or reduction of strength), it produces an electric field that acts in a circle around the lines of magnetic force (though it may also act in other directions).
By summing the work done in moving unit electric charge around the circle, we obtain what is called the net electromotive force around the circle.
\footnote{
    In physical terms, we obtain the net capacity of the electric field to move current along the circle.
}
If the circle were made of wire, the changing magnetic lines would of course induce the flow of a current; but even without a wire&emdash;and therefore no current&emdash;a force would be induced.
Dividing this force by the area enclosed by the circle gives the net electromotive force (per unit area) which &ldquo;curls&rdquo; around the circle.
Now imagine the circle growing smaller and smaller and shrinking finally to the point <span class="math">P</span>.
By this limiting process we obtain a limiting value of the net electromotive force per unit area: this is curl <span class="math">E</span> at <span class="math">P</span>.
Thus equation 3 says that the limiting value of electromotive force per unit area equals the rate of change of <span class="math">H</span> at the point <span class="math">P</span>,

multiplied by the tiny negative fraction, $-\frac{1}{c}$.
\footnote{
    The symbol <span class="math">c</span>, which here stands for the ratio of the electrostatic to the electromagnetic units of electricity, is required to translate <span class="math">E</span> (an electrostatic phenomenon) and <span class="math">H</span> (an electromagnetic phenomenon) into the same system of units.
    The equation explains how Maxwell was able to connect electrical and magnetic phenomena with the velocity of light, for <span class="math">c</span> is in fact that velocity.
}
Or, again, more loosely stated, a changing magnetic field creates an electric field whose electromotive force per unit area at any given point and instant of time equals the time rate of change of the magnetic field at that point and instant.

Equation 4

\begin{equation}
    curl H = \frac{1}{c} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
\end{equation}

says that, except for the change in algebraic sign (which has to do with the directions of the fields), the roles of <span class="math">E</span> and <span class="math">H</span> in equation 3 may be reversed.
At any given point and instant the magnetomotive force (the analogue for magnetic fields of electromotive force) per unit of area created by a changing electric field is equal to the time rate of change of the electric field multiplied by the tiny positive fraction $\frac{l}{c}$.
Now, the reader who has followed this discussion will perceive that the time rate of change of <span class="math">E</span>, $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$, is none other than Maxwell&#39;s displacement current.
For since the changes are taking place in the dielectric known as empty space, the only currents that can flow are displacement currents.
\footnote{
    Equation 4 assumes the existence of this current and relates it quantitatively to the magnetomotive force generated by the existent magnetic field.
    Physically we may regard the magnetic field as creating the displacement current or, conversely, regard the displacement current as creating the accompanying magnetic field and magnetomotive force.
}
Prior to Maxwell, it was thought that the magnetic field H could be produced only by currents that flowed in wires passing through the circle.
If no wires were present, the law thought to be applicable was $curl H = 0$
It was Maxwell&#39;s great discovery, deduced mechanically from his model and expressed mathematically in this equation, that a time-varying electric field produces (or must be accompanied by) a net &ldquo;curled&rdquo; magnetic force even in an insulator or empty space.
\footnote{
    Maxwell called $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ the displacement current, the term &ldquo;displacement&rdquo; meaning that the electric field intensity <span class="math">E</span> was being altered or displaced as time varies, and the term &ldquo;current&rdquo; suggesting that $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ had the properties of a current flowing in a wire even though $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ existed in empty space.
}
According to Maxwell&#39;s theory, the introduction of a timevarying electric force in a dielectric produces displacement waves with the velocity of light.
To put it another way, it is the surge and ebbing of the force that produces the periodic displacement waves; a static charge would merely create an instantaneous displacement, which would be fixed, but not a wave.
Now, an electric current, as we have seen, whether in a dielectric or in a conductor, is accompanied by a magnetic force; and similarly a periodic wave of electric displacement is accompanied by a periodic magnetic force.
The wave front itself, as Maxwell showed, comprises electric vibrations at right angles to the direction of propagation and a magnetic force at right angles to the electric displacement.
The compound disturbance is therefore called an electromagnetic wave.
A light wave (which is a displacement wave) is, as Henri Poincar&eacute; later elaborated, &ldquo;a series of alternating currents, flowing in a dielectric, in the air, or in interplanetary space, changing their direction 1,000,000,000,000,000 times a second.
The enormous inductive effect of these rapid alternations produces other currents in the neighboring portions of the dielectric, and thus the light waves are propagated from place to place.&rdquo;


The electromagnetic theory of light was testable experimentally, and indeed stood up remarkably well in laboratory trials.
But this was only a limited confirmation of Maxwell&#39;s system, for if his reasoning was correct, there must be other electrical waves produced by initial disturbances of differing intensity.
These waves would differ from light in wave length and would therefore not be visible, yet it should be possible to detect them with appropriate instruments.
How to find them, not to say generate them, was now the crucial problem.
Maxwell did not live to see it solved. Not until ten years after his death were his prophecies fulfilled and the skepticism of his most distinguished contemporaries refuted.
As late as 1888 Lord Kelvin referred to Maxwell&#39;s waves as a &ldquo;curious and ingenious, but not wholly tenable hypothesis&rdquo;; but a year later Helmholtz&#39;s greatest pupil, Heinrich Hertz, nosed out Oliver Lodge in the race to demonstrate their existence.
In a series of brilliant experiments he showed how electric waves could be &ldquo;excited&rdquo; (i.e., generated) by oscillation and detected by a circular conductor provided with a small gap; and how they could be polarized, reflected, refracted, made to form shadows and to interfere with each other.
The connection, he said, &ldquo;between light and electricity &hellip; of which there were hints and suspicions and even predictions in the theory, is now established &hellip; Optics is no longer restricted to minute aether waves, a small fraction of a millimetre in length; its domain is extended to waves that are measured in decimetres, metres and kilometres.
And in spite of this extension, it appears merely &hellip; as a small appendage of the great domain of electricity.
We see that this latter has become a mighty kingdom.&rdquo;

The Treatise, written while Maxwell was &ldquo;in retirement&rdquo; at Glenlair, drew only part of his energy.
As a &ldquo;by-work&rdquo; during the same period he wrote a textbook on heat, which appeared in 1870, and a number of papers of considerable importance on mathematics, color vision and topics of physics.
He maintained a heavy scientific and social correspondence, enlarged his house, studied theology, composed stanzas of execrable verse, rode his horse, went on long walks with his dogs, visited his neighbors and played with their children, and made frequent trips to Cambridge to serve as moderator and examiner in the mathematical tripos.


In 1871 a chair in experimental physics was founded at Cambridge.
It is hard to realize that at the time no courses in heat, electricity and magnetism were being taught there, and no laboratory was available for the pursuit of these arcane matters.
The University, as a contemporary scholar delicately observed, &ldquo;had lost touch with the great scientific movements going on outside her walls.&rdquo;
A committee of the faculty began to bestir itself, a report was issued, and the lamentable facts fell under the gaze of the Duke of Devonshire, Chancellor of the University.
He offered the money for the building and furnishing of the famous Cavendish Laboratory.
Thomson, it was known, would not leave his post at Glasgow to take the new chair, and Maxwell, though at first reluctant to leave Glenlair, yielded to the urging of his friends to offer himself as a candidate.
He was promptly elected.


He now devoted himself to the task of designing and superintending the erection of the laboratory.
His aim was to make it the best institution of its kind, with the latest apparatus and the most effective arrangements for research.
He inspected Thomson&#39;s laboratory at Glasgow and Clifton&#39;s at Oxford to learn the desirable features of both and embody them in the Cavendish.
He presented to the laboratory all the apparatus in his own possession and supplemented the Duke&#39;s gift by generous money contributions.
With so many details to be taken care of, the structure and its appointments were not completed until 1874. The delay, while inevitable, was inconvenient.
&ldquo;I have no place,&rdquo; wrote Maxwell, &ldquo;to erect my chair, but move about like the cuckoo, depositing my notions in the Chemical Lecture Room in the first term, in the Botannical in Lent and in the Comparative Anatomy in Easter.&rdquo;
His &ldquo;notions&rdquo; were the courses he gave, beginning in 1871, on heat, electricity and electromagnetism, a schedule maintained throughout the tenure of his chair.
And though the audiences were often small, some of the best students were soon attracted to his lectures, which contained much important original work.
The renaissance that followed in physical science at Cambridge was the direct result of his influence.


Maxwell&#39;s classic Matter and Motion, &ldquo;a small book on a great subject,&rdquo; was published in 1876.
About this time he contributed articles on various subjects&emdash;&ldquo;Atom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Aether,&rdquo; &ldquo;Attraction,&rdquo; &ldquo;Faraday,&rdquo; among others&emdash;to the famous ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
His public lectures include a charming discourse &ldquo;On the Telephone,&rdquo; which, though delivered when he was already very ill, is not only as clear as his best expositions but filled with gay, amusing asides.
Speaking, for example, of &ldquo;Professor Bell&#39;s invention,&rdquo; he comments on &ldquo;the perfect symmetry of the whole apparatus&emdash;the wire in the middle, the two telephones at the ends of the wire, and the two gossips at the ends of the telephones &rdquo;A task that occupied him for five years, almost to the very end of his life, was editing twenty packets of unpublished scientific papers of Henry Cavendish, who was greatuncle to the Duke of Devonshire.
This splendid two-volume work, published in 1879, did much to fix the reputation of an immensely gifted investigator, whose important work on electricity was unknown to his contemporaries because the results were confided only to his manuscripts.
Maxwell repeated Cavendish&#39;s experiments and showed that he had anticipated major discoveries in electricity, including electrostatic capacity, specific inductive capacity and Ohm&#39;s law.


As Maxwell grew older, friends remarked on his &ldquo;ever-in-creasing soberness&rdquo; of spirit.
This must not be taken to mean he was invariably melancholy or withdrawn or that his nice sense of fun&emdash;about himself no less than about others&emdash;had vanished.
He continued to see his many friends, to write light verse and parodies, to promenade with his dog Toby, who was at Maxwell&#39;s side even in the laboratory, to play small practical, but never mean, jokes, to engage in what was called &ldquo;humorous mystification&rdquo; by advancing preposterous scientific ideas in conversation while keeping a straight face.
All things, he once remarked, are &ldquo;full of jokes,&rdquo; though they are also &ldquo;quite full of solemn matters,&rdquo; and he was as likely to stress their light as their grave aspect.


But it is true he became somewhat more reticent with the passing years, and more and more concealed his feelings and reflections beneath an ironical shell.
The tough, rational, Scotch common-sense cord of his nature had always been intertwined with threads of mysticism. Often plain, even blunt, in his address, he also had an allusive way of speaking and showed a fondness for parables.
He had faith in science, yet he was at bottom skeptical as to how much could be learned from science alone about nature and meaning.
It was all very well, he felt, to have &ldquo;ideal aspirations&rdquo;; on the other hand, &ldquo;It&#39;s no use thinking of the chap ye might have been.&rdquo;
His contemporaries remember him as both modest and intellectually scornful, tentative in his scientific opinions and dogmatic when others seemed to him to be immoderately self-assured.


&ldquo;No one knows what is meant by&rdquo; so-and-so was his way of answering a cocksure formulation of a scientific &ldquo;truth.&rdquo;


The most striking of Maxwell&#39;s traits was his gentleness.
&ldquo;His tenderness for all living things was deep and instinctive; from earliest childhood he could not hurt a fly.&rdquo;
An extraordinary selflessness characterized his relationship to those close to him.
When his brother-in-law came to London to undergo an operation, Maxwell gave up the ground floor of his house to patient and nurse and left himself with a room so small that he frequently breakfasted on his knees because there was no room for a chair at the table.
Mrs. Maxwell had a serious and prolonged illness in the last years of Maxwell&#39;s life, and he insisted on nursing her.
On one occasion it is reported that he did not sleep in a bed for three weeks.
But his work went on as usual, and he was as cheerful as if he enjoyed the ordeal&emdash;which may indeed have been the case.
Nor did he give the slightest sign of being downcast or show self-pity when his own fatal illness seized him.


In the spring of 1877 he began to be troubled with pain and a choking sensation on swallowing.
For some strange reason he consulted no one about his symptoms for almost two years, though his condition grew steadily worse.
His friends at Cambridge observed that he was failing, that the spring had gone out of his step.
When he went home to Glenlair for the summer of 1879, he was so obviously weakening that he called for medical help.
He was in terrible pain, &ldquo;hardly able to lie still for a minute together, sleepless, and with no appetite for the food which he so required.&rdquo;
He understood thoroughly that his case was hopeless, yet his main concern seemed to be about the health of his wife. In October he was told he had only a month to live.
On November 5 he died. &ldquo;No man,&rdquo; wrote his physician, Dr. Paget, &ldquo;ever met death more consciously or more calmly.&rdquo;
When Maxwell was buried in Parton Churchyard at Glenlair, the world had not yet caught up with his ideas.
Even today it has not fully explored the kingdom created by his imagination.
