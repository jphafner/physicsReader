It might appear that following a discussion of the nature of sound, the logical subject to consider would be the criteria for reproducing this sound with &ldquo;high fidelity&rdquo; to the original. One other element, however, should be covered first&emdash;the way in which we hear.

## Perception of Sound

We have already seen, in examining units of measurement for pitch and power&emdash;the octave and the decibel&emdash;that our perception of sound does not necessarily correspond directly to the objective reality.
The illusion is consistent, however, so that a given sound always has the same effect on a normal ear.


An important element in the perception of sound was discovered by Fletcher and Munson in 1933.
These investigators demonstrated that our impression of loudness did not depend solely on the amplitude of the sound wave, but on other things as well.
Specifically, they showed that sound in the lower treble range of the frequency spectrum-the 3,500 cps region&emdash;appeared to be much louder than sound of the same amplitude at any other part of the spectrum.
Thus, if the frequency scale was swept by a tone which continuously rose in frequency but kept exactly the same amplitude, the loudness, or apparent amplitude, would increase to a maximum at about 3500 cps and then fall off again.


This fact does not have much practical interest for the person listening to reproduced music, except as it describes the relative nuisance value of different types of noise.
No matter how lop-sided our interpretation of acoustic reality, we make the same interpretation in the concert hall as in our living room, and the craftsmen who designed musical instruments (who worked to satisfy their ears, not sound-level meters) perceived sound in the same way.


Fletcher and Munson made a second discovery, however, that does bear directly on the reproduction of sound.
They found that the effect described above took place in varying degree, depending on the over-all level of the sound.
For very high amplitude sound the drop in loudness with frequency below 3,500 cps hardly occurred at all, while for very soft sound the effect was maximum.
Above 3,500 cps the effect remained constant, within 2 dB or 3 dB, no matter what the over-all sound level.


The well-known &ldquo;equal loudness contours,&rdquo; also referred to as the Fletcher-Munson curves, are reproduced in Fig. \ref{fig:2-1}.
Each curve plots the sound amplitude required to produce the same perceived loudness at different frequencies of the scale.
It can be seen that normal hearing losses in the bass end become progressively greater as the over-all sound level is decreased.


This means that if an orchestra plays a musical passage at the sound level represented by 90 dB, and if this music is reproduced at the 60 dB level, we will hear the bass with less relative loudness than we would have heard it at the concert itself.
If you follow the 90 dB and 60 dB curves, shown superimposed in Fig. \ref{fig:2-2}, you will see that there is approximately a 14 dB perceived loss at 50 cps&emdash;it takes 14 dB more of actual amplitude, in the lower curve, to produce the same relative loudness at 50 cps as it does in the upper curve.


In order to re-create the original balance of perceived frequencies at low volume levels, it has become customary to introduce bass boost which is related to the setting of the volume control, either automatically or otherwise.


A volume control tied to automatic bass boost is called a loudness control.
(Some loudness controls also boost the treble spectrum appreciably at low volume settings.
There is no justification for this in the Fletcher-Munson curves.)

## High Fidelity to What?


The assumption will be made here that the purpose of high fidelity equipment is to reproduce as closely as possible the experience of the concert hall, not to transcend or improve it.


I remember an exhibition at New York&#39;s Museum of Modern Art, during the late thirties, of &ldquo;high fidelity&rdquo; reproductions of water color paintings.
Lifesize reproductions were hung side by side with the originals, and it was often difficult or impossible to tell them apart.
There was no question in anyone&#39;s mind about how to judge the quality of these prints.
The only criterion was accuracy.
The public that visited the exhibit was used to looking at paintings, and was able to make an immediate comparison between the copy and the original.
No one thought of the prints as entities in themselves, with qualities independent of the qualities of the originals.

This point of view does not always hold in the field of high fidelity musical reproduction.
Only a minority of today&#39;s high fidelity public are concert-goers.
Many have never attended a live concert; they know the sound of the orchestra or of individual musical instruments only as it is reported by amplifiers and loudspeakers.
They may know what they like in reproduced sound, but they have no way of evaluating the realism of reproduction.


This partly explains why so much variation is tolerated in audio equipment.
The same record may sound very different when played through different brands of equipment, each brand equally acceptable in the market place.
The evaluation of high fidelity components is popularly thought of as an entirely subjective matter, like comparing the tone of one violin to that of another rather than like holding a facsimile up to its original.


For similar reasons high fidelity demonstrations such as the annual Hi-Fi shows can get away with a lot of sound that is startling but essentially non-musical.
Some of the &ldquo;reproduced&rdquo; sound that greets the show visitor is necessarily unfamiliar because it has no live counterpart.
A harmonica blown up in volume to the dimensions of a theatre organ is a new and different instrument.
A crooner whispering into a microphone an inch away invents a new sound; his unamplified voice is never heard in public.
A combination of Bongo drum, chimes and electric guitar creates a <em>tutti</em> which one may like or dislike, but for which there is no equivalent in one&#39;s memory to serve as a live standard.

Such sound can only be accepted as a self-sufficient entity, like an old calendar chromo.
Any resemblance to five music or to painting is purely coincidental, and the science and/or art of reproduction is not really involved.

High fidelity has undoubtedly increased rather than decreased the ranks of music lovers, and there are probably more people than ever who are unimpressed with gimmick sound.
Many designers and manufacturers in the field work only for naturalness of reproduction.
The designer of integrity avoids like the plague those exaggerations that sometimes attract the novice&emdash;over-emphasized bass for &ldquo;depth,&rdquo; over-emphasized mid-range for &ldquo;presence,&rdquo; over-emphasized treble for &ldquo;brilliance.&rdquo;
These distortions are more properly called, respectively, boominess, nasality or &ldquo;honkiness,&rdquo; and harshness.


Many demonstrations are not, fortunately, of the gimmick type, and use musical material played at musical levels.
There have also been concerts staged with live musicians, in which direct comparisons of reproduced sound to the sound of the live instruments could be made, in the same way that direct comparisons of prints to original paintings were made at the Museum of Modern Art.
The live vs. recorded public concert is one method of giving direction to equipment designers and perspective to high fidelity consumers.
Although transferring concert hall atmosphere to the home has special problems of its own, success in creating an identity of sound in the concert hall itself solves the major part of the problem.
Even more vital to maintaining balance and perspective in the high fidelity world is live concert attendance.


We are now prepared to discuss the technical standards of quality that may be applied to a sound reproducing system.
There will be no dividing lines proposed, at which low fidelity becomes medium, high, or super.

## Frequency Response

The frequency response of a sound reproducing system, or of one of its components, describes its relative handling of parts of the input signal which differ in frequency.
&ldquo;Handling&rdquo; may refer to electrical amplification, as in an amplifier, to conversion of mechanical to electrical energy, as in a pickup, or to conversion from electrical to acoustical energy, as in a loudspeaker.


There are two aspects of frequency response: the range of frequencies handled, and the uniformity with which the unit or system responds to different frequencies.
Knowledge of the first of these is useless without knowledge of the second.
Let us therefore pass over the question of range for the moment, and determine what uniformity will be required for the range we finally decide on.

## Uniformity of Response

Although the trained ear can usually perceive a change of sound level of a db or less in test signals, the average observer is probably less sensitive to a change of sound level in a particular frequency range of a musical passage.


Reproduction which remains constant over its frequency range within one or two db would thus probably be adequate for perfect apparent fidelity, other things being equal.


This standard can be met in amplifiers without much difficulty, even at high power levels.
The best pickups are also able to conform, but loudspeakers are laggard in this respect.


The results of non-uniform reproduction are several.
Undue volume in a particular section of the sound spectrum can produce stridency or boominess as opposed to natural musical sound.
More particularly, the existence of sharp peaks in the response curve, usually representing a resonant condition, mean that hangover or ringing may be present&emdash;the speaker cone or section of cone will continue to vibrate after the signal has stopped.
This is perceived as a &ldquo;rainbarrel&rdquo; effect, a muddying up of the sound and impairment of the distinctness of the different instrumental voices.
Such an effect is also indicated when the listener is unable to distinguish clearly the pitch of low-frequency tones.


Another important effect of peaked frequency response is the exaggeration of unwanted noise components such as turntable rumble or record surface scratch.
This effect was not given its due recognition in the earlier days of high fidelity, when the existence of rumble and surface noise was proudly displayed as evidence of extended frequency range.


The amount of surface noise in a good quality modern LP record and the amount of rumble from a good record player are such that there will not be much significant noise produced in a system with uniform frequency response, even though the frequency range be extended to the limits of the present state of the art.
In a comparison test conducted recently between two tweeters, the one which was able to reproduce almost an octave more of treble (into the inaudible region) showed a dramatic decrease of surface noise, due to its extreme evenness of response.
There was no selective reproduction of discrete frequency regions, and the switch to the superior speaker produced a fuller, more natural treble simultaneously with the reduction in surface noise.


A similar situation exists with regard to turntable rumble.
A peaked system whose response falls off rapidly below 60 cps may exhibit more turntable rumble than a smooth system whose full response extends an octave lower.

Tell-tale evidence of the existence of peaked reproduction in the bass may be gathered from listening to the reproduction of speech.
The male speaking voice ordinarily contains no sound components whose frequency is below 100 cps, and the reproducing system should give no hint (by a boomy, resonant quality in the voice) that it is also capable of speaking in the tones of the double bass.

## Range of Response

It is generally agreed among acoustics authorities that the range of 40 to 15,000 cps is sufficient for perfect or near-perfect apparent fidelity in the reproduction of orchestral music. The phrase &ldquo;near-perfect&rdquo; is meant to imply that when such a range has been achieved the designer should direct his attention to inaccuracies of reproduction more gross than are associated with the frequency limitations indicated.

For the pipe organ enthusiast, however, there is significant intelligence (significant, that is, from the point of view of the emotional impact of the music) down to 32 cps or lower, 32.7cps is three octaves below middle C relative to A-440, and is the lowest note of the average pipe organ, although many larger organs reach down an octave lower.
These low organ tones are distinguished by the fact that they contain a strong fundamental component.
The lowest tones of the piano, on the other hand, contain no fundamental energy that significantly affects the quality of the sound.
Even though the lowest key on the piano strikes 27.5 cps, response down to this frequency is not required for the reproduction of piano music.

Probably no characteristic of audio components is so freely booted about by advertising copywriters as frequency range.
Any numerical range of frequencies listed is totally meaningless unless accompanied by a description of the decibel tolerance above or below reference that is being used, and, for a loudspeaker, by a description of off-axis response as well.
A 3 inch speaker made for portable radios will &ldquo;respond&rdquo; when stimulated by a 30 cps signal&emdash;perhaps by having its cone tear loose and fly out into the air&emdash;and almost any speaker, even a woofer, will make some kind of sound when stimulated by a high-powered 15,000 cps signal.
A frequency response rating must mean something more than that a signal of given frequency makes a speaker move audibly, or that it makes an amplifier show an electrical output of some sort at its terminals.
It must mean that within a stated frequency range, and, for power devices, within a stated range of power, the fundamental output of a given device is uniform to a stated degree.

## Treble Dispersion

The on-axis response of a loudspeaker may be very deceiving, because the higher frequencies tend to be directed in a beam which continually narrows as the frequency is raised.
Good sound dispersion must therefore be a qualifying factor for any treble response curve.


A speaker which has relatively uniform treble output both on-axis and off-axis (over a reasonably large solid angle&emdash;perhaps 45 degrees in any direction from the axis) will reproduce music with a &ldquo;spaciousness&rdquo; that does not exist when there is more concentrated beaming of the treble.
Furthermore, severely attenuated off-axis response in the treble means that the total sound power radiated at treble frequencies is considerably less than that implied by the on-axis response curve.
It is this total radiated power, rather than the on-axis pressure, that determines whether a speaker will sound dull, natural, or over-bright in a normally reverberant room.

## Transient Response

Transient response refers to the accuracy of reproduction of the wave envelope, and is concerned with the reproduction of attack and decay characteristics of the sound.
We have seen that uniform frequency response predicts the absence of ringing; if the steady-state frequency response curve does not have peaks, the reproduced sound will die away just as in the original.

Consider, for example, the tone represented in (A) of Fig. \ref{fig:2-3}.
Perfect reproduction would produce an identical wave form, differing perhaps only in amplitude, while poor transient response would be indicated by the hangover that is apparent in (B).
The continuation of the reproduced signal after the original has ended may be compared to a color smear on a reproduced painting.

<figure>

\label{fig:2-3}

</figure>


Attack time involves the reproduction of frequencies higher than the fundamental.
Although a percussive tone may have a low fundamental pitch, the frequency components associated with its steep attack characteristic may be very high.
Natural reproduction of a drum beat through a two-way speaker system may thus be accomplished by the &ldquo;woofer&rdquo; handling the fundamental tone and its proper decay, while the &ldquo;tweeter&rdquo; contributes the sound components that make up the sharp attack.


## Harmonic and Intermodulatlon Distortion

Reproducing devices have a characteristic way of performing with less than perfect accuracy.
In addition to the frequencies at which they are asked to vibrate mechanically (or alternate electrically) they introduce new modes of oscillation of their own&emdash;and these new frequencies are harmonics, integral multiples of the original frequency.
This inaccuracy is called harmonic distortion.
It is measured as the ratio of the amplitude of the spurious harmonics to the true signal, in per cent.


We have seen that harmonics of fundamental frequencies are produced in any case by musical instruments.
Yet small amounts of harmonic distortion produce very unpleasant effects.
The sound becomes harsh, unmusical; the bass is wooden and the treble painful.


The primary reason for this is that with harmonic distortion comes an attendant evil&emdash;intermodulation distortion.
Intermodulation distortion can be described as the introduction of new sound components, at sum and difference frequencies, when tones of two or more frequencies are passed through a non-linear system&emdash;that is, a system which creates harmonic distortion.
These sum and difference frequencies are harmonically unrelated to the original musical tones.
They are musically discordant, and they serve to create raucous, unmusical sound in a degree proportional to their relative strength.
The formation of intermodulation products is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:2-4}.


<figure>
\label{fig:2-4}
\caption{
    Intermodulation distortion as a result of harmonic distortion of the low-frequency wave form.
    Note that the wave envelope of the high-frequency tone is &ldquo;modulated.&rdquo;
}
</figure>

The primary importance of low distortion has always been recognized by audio authorities.
It has also become increasingly recognized by the high fidelity public in recent years, after the first flush of excitement over reproducing regions of the frequency spectrum previously untouched.
Amplifier manufacturers now feature distortion data over frequency response data; unfortunately it is very rare for loudspeaker specifications to make any quantitative reference to distortion at all.
The reason lies in the fact that while both harmonic distortion and intermodulation distortion (the latter is usually greater by a factor of 3 or 4) can be kept to extremely low values in high quality amplifiers&emdash;a small fraction of one per cent at rated power&emdash;the corresponding values for loudspeakers are much higher.
In the octave below 60 cps it is a rare speaker indeed which can hold harmonic distortion, at any appreciable sound level, below the 5 per cent mark over the entire octave, and many speakers produce percentages of distortion in this frequency region ten times as great.
But the listening results are not as bad as might appear at first glance: speaker response is normally severely attenuated in this lower range, which helps, and there is comparatively little musical material of such low frequency to be distorted.


When the reproducing system has a minimum of low frequency distortion, very low bass tones of high power, such as might be produced by organ pedal pipes, not only remain pure in timbre themselves but do not create intermodulation with the rest of the music; they do not destroy the purity of the treble by introducing false tones.

## Power Capability

The power capability of a high-quality reproducing system should be such as to be able to establish an intensity level of sound in the living room equal to the level at a good seat in the original concert hall.
The electrical power required of the amplifier for achieving this goal depends upon the efficiency of the speaker, and the sound power required of the speaker depends on the size and other acoustical characteristics of the room.
Concert-hall level can be established in a living room with a tiny fraction of the acoustical power of a symphony orchestra, because the lower power is concentrated in a much smaller area.


&ldquo;Concert-hall level&rdquo; is sometimes misinterpreted to mean the sound level which would be created if the orchestra were somehow jammed into the living room itself.
The writer has yet to experience at a live concert, even during fortissimo passages, an assault on his ears that compares to hi-fi assaults he has weathered.
It is interesting to note that certain hi-fi demonstrations preclude intelligible conversation which is not shouted, while whispered conversations in a concert hall are liable to prove extremely distracting and annoying to one&#39;s neighbors.
It is the sound intensity level at the ear, not the power of the orchestra, that we are trying to reproduce.

## Noise Level

Any sound component not present in the original program material, other than distortion products, is referred to as noise, even though it may be periodic and not conform to our strictly scientific definition.
Hum, rumble, surface scratch, tube hiss or other circuit noise and similar disturbances tend to destroy the auditory illusion, and must be kept to a minimum.

A standard for satisfactorily low noise has been established by the FCC for FM broadcast stations.
It is that the power ratio of the maximum signal to the noise must always be at least 60 db; this represents a ratio of one million to one.

## Dynamic Range

The dynamic range, or range of amplitude of the reproduced sound from softest to loudest, is determined by the two factors just discussed, noise level and power capability.

Soft musical passages can be masked by any of the types of noise referred to, and therefore the lowest sound levels that can be used must be much louder than the noise level.
The maximum sound levels that can be used, of course, are limited by the power capability of the system.

A dynamic range of 60 db, or a million to one power ratio between highest and lowest sound levels, is generally considered adequate for reproduction of the largest symphony orchestra.

## Stereo

All of the above considerations apply equally to monaural and to stereophonic reproducing systems.
These objective elements of equipment fidelity&emdash;low distortion, adequate frequency response, dynamic range, etc.&emdash;are able, in stereo, to contribute more to the subjective illusion of musical reality than in a monaural system.

A stereo record-reproduce system has in effect two parallel and complete monaural systems.
The work of each component along the way is done twice.
The sound is picked up by two separate microphones; the output of each microphone is recorded on a separate track of the tape; the record groove, although not doubled, is cut in such a way as to independently contain the record of each signal channel; the pickup contains two separate generating elements which independently sense and transmit each signal channel; the two signal outputs of the pickup are sent through independent amplifiers and fed to two independent loudspeakers.
There are variations on this ideal scheme, but the above describes the basic concept of stereo.

The purpose of this dual-channel reproduction is, in the simplest terms, to help recreate the acoustical atmosphere of the concert hall.
In the old-fashioned stereopticon each visual channel gave a slightly different perspective view of the subject.
Similarly, in stereo recording, each microphone gets a slightly different auditory perspective.
It is important to note that this auditory perspective is of the orchestra or soloists in the hall in which they are performing, not merely of the musical performers in the abstract.
This is important because a good part of the sound that reaches our ears at a concert does not come directly from the orchestra, but is reflected from the walls and ceiling of the concert hall.

The channels of a stereo system are identified as &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;left.&rdquo;
This does not mean that one microphone picks up the sound of the right section of the orchestra only, and that the other microphone picks up the sound from the left section of the orchestra.
It does mean that one microphone has a rightoriented perspective of the total sound in the recording hall, and that the other microphone has a left-oriented perspective of the total sound.
When these two recorded channels (which, like the two photos on a stereopticon card, are very similar to each other) are reproduced through two separate loudspeakers they create, although not perfectly, the illusion of the acoustical environment and sense of space of the concert hall.
There is an increased awareness of the physical position of different instruments, but this is very much less important than the general increase in realism and the consequent increase of clarity, particularly from the point of view of the distinctness of the different musical voices.


There is an approach to stereo recording, commonly referred to as &ldquo;ping-pong&rdquo; stereo, which provides an exaggerated separation between the right and left channels.
If only the left side of the orchestra were playing during a particular passage, there would be practically no sound from the right recording channel.
The left-right orientation of the different instruments is the primary goal in this case, rathe; than reproduction of the original acoustical environment.
The degree to which one&#39;s attention is directed to the physical position of the instruments in &ldquo;ping-pong&rdquo; stereo is often much greater than that at the live concert itself.


The greatest benefit of good stereo recording and reproduction is that it frees us, to a greater extent than was possible previously, from the acoustical environment of the listening room, and transports us to some extent to the acoustical environment of the hall in which the recording was made.
The normal living room does not provide the proper acoustical atmosphere for a musical concert, particularly of a large orchestra. Musical instrument designers worked in terms of the tonal qualities that would be produced in the type of concert hall with which they were familiar.

%% NOTE: chapter
## The Sound Reproducing System

The phonograph is a classic example of an invention that cannot be credited wholly to one man.
In 1877 Edison directed his assistant, John Kruesi, to construct the first complete recordreproduce system, but sound recorders were sold on a commercial b?sis as early as 1860, and Thomas Young&#39;s &ldquo;A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy&rdquo; described and illustrated a crude but practical sound recorder in 1807.

Young&#39;s recorder consisted of a sharp metal stylus held by spring tension against a revolving cylinder, the cylinder coated with wax and turned by a governor-controlled gravity motor.
When a vibrating body such as a tuning fork was held against the stylus, a wavy line was cut into the wax.
This line represented the wave form of the vibrations, and it could be studied and analyzed at leisure.
The recorder was a mechanical draftsman, that could sense very small motions and record pressure changes that took place within a period of a very small fraction of a second.

By 1856 Leon Scott de Martinville had constructed the &ldquo;phonautograph&rdquo; (self-writer of sound) illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:3-1}.
The sound wave form was scratched by a hog-bristle stylus on the surface of a cylinder coated with lampblack, but the big advance over Young&#39;s machine was the fact that the phonautograph could record directly from the air.
The force of the acoustical vibrations was concentrated by a horn onto a diaphragm, and the stylus was attached to the diaphragm, so that the recording needle did not have to actually touch the vibrating source of sound.
This device, which corresponds in function to the modern oscilloscope, was a catalogue item of the Paris firm of Koenig, and was sold as a measuring instrument to acoustical laboratories.

The phonautograph which is at the Smithsonian Institution at Washington would undoubtedly reproduce music if a proper record were placed on its revolving cylinder.
The theoretical possibility of playback was understood then, too, but the lampblack records were useless for playback, as their grooves were not rigid enough to direct the vibrations of a playback needle.
About half a year before Edison got his brainstorm Charles Cros conceived a method for bringing the groove sinuosities back to life as sound.
The lampblack recording was to be photo-engraved on a metal cylinder, and running a needle through the hard groove would then cause the needle to vibrate from side to side, in the same time pattern as the hog bristle stylus that first inscribed the line.

For reasons which may be related to nineteenth century differences in tradition between the scholar and the industrial engineer, Cros didn&#39;t even construct a working model, but merely filed a complete, sealed description of his system with the Academie des Sciences.
On the other hand, less than a month after Edison first conceived of a reproducing phonograph the country was reading about a working unit in newspaper headlines.
There was a great stir of excitement over this amazing tonal imitator, (see Fig. \ref{fig:3-2}) with public demonstrations, lectures before august scientific bodies, and a visit to the White House.


<figure>
\label{fig:3-2}
\caption{

</figure>

The excitement soon died down, as the Edison machine was an impractical toy, with neither permanent records nor usable fidelity.
The recorded groove was indented into a semi-hard material, tin foil; it was only able to retain its shape partially, and that for very few playings.
Subsequent technical improvements, however, made the phonograph a popular device by the turn of the century.
It is curious that our modem recording system, in which the record is a mechanical copy of the original master, is more closely related to Cros&#39; system than to Edison&#39;s.
Emil Berliner, the father of the moulded or cast record, began his research work by successfully carrying out Cros&#39; proposals.


## The Mechanical or &ldquo;Acoustic&rdquo; Phonograph

It would be useful to consider the design of the non-electric phonograph, as illustrated in (A) of Fig. \ref{fig:3-3}.
A better insight can thereby be gained into the function of the various components of a modern electronic system.

<figure>
\label{fig:3-3}
\caption{(A) The mechanical phonograph. (B) The electric phonograph. }
</figure>


The wave forms frozen into the record groove control the vibrations of the playback stylus when the groove is dragged past the stylus by a revolving turntable. 
These stylus vibrations, although they contain a fairly large amount of mechanical energy, engage practically no air, like the revolutions of a bladeless electric fan.
The needle is therefore attached to a diaphragm, which vibrates in sympathy with the stylus and has a much larger surface area in contact with the air of the room.


But even the reproducing diaphragm doesn&#39;t get a sufficient bite of the air for practical purposes.
Therefore the diaphragm is placed at the narrow throat of an acoustical horn, and the actual usable sound emerges into the room from the much larger mouth of the horn.
The system works somewhat as though the diaphragm area were really that of the horn&#39;s mouth.


It can be seen that all of the energy radiated by the horn is taken from the mechanical vibrations of the needle, and the forces between needle and record groove are necessarily great.
This has obvious implications for record wear, but perhaps more important, the demands for power placed on the &ldquo;sound box&rdquo; or &ldquo;speaker&rdquo; (old-fashioned terms for the needle-diaphragm-head assembly) place a severe limitation on musical fidelity.
High distortion and peaked and severely limited frequency response are to be expected.

## The Phonograph Amplifier

The solution to this problem lies in changing the function of the phonograph pickup, from the primary generator of sound power to a device which controls an outside source of power.
If the power from the outside source is made to oscillate in imitation of the needle vibrations, two benefits can result:

1. The final output sound derived from the record groove can be much louder.

2. The power demands on the pickup itself are no longer heavy.
The pickup can be designed for quality rather than loudness; the problems of achieving uniform, extended frequency response and low distortion are considerably lessened.
So, incidentally, is the required weight on the pickup and the grinding away of the record groove.

The control of an outside source of power to conform to given oscillations is called amplification.
The first phonograph amplifier was pneumatic: the needle was made to actuate an air valve, which periodically throttled a flow of compressed air.
Most of the work of radiating sound power was thus performed by the air compressor, and the stylus was relieved of part of its burden.


All modern sound reproducing systems use amplifiers, but unlike the first pneumatic systems these amplifiers are electronic.
The phonograph pickup is no longer a sound generator but an electric generator.
It produces small alternating voltages at its terminals, whose wave forms conform to those of the groove and of the recorded sound.
The pickup has to generate very little power, because the output voltage can be amplified to almost any desired degree.
The amplified electrical power must finally, of course, be converted back into sound by a loudspeaker.
The two types of reproducing system, electrical and purely mechanical, are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:3-3}.

## The Modern Sound Reproducing System

The purpose of the historical approach used above has been to furnish the reader with an appreciation of the reason for the modern audio system being designed as it is.
With the electronic amplifier supplying the brute force, so to speak, the mechanical components&emdash;pickup and loudspeaker&emdash;can be built in such a way as to suppress the natural resonant tendencies inherent in mechanical vibratory systems.


Before discussing each of the audio components in detail, it would be useful to make a brief survey of the entire reproducing system.
A complete monaural system is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:3-4}.


First of all the disc record must be revolved by a motor and turntable.
The chief operational requirements of this part of the system are that it revolve at the correct speed, that the speed be constant, and that extraneous vibrations do not communicate themselves to the pickup.


The first of these requirements is for the purpose of keeping the reproduced music at the same absolute pitch at which it was recorded: too fast a turntable speed will make the pitch sharp, and too low a speed will make it flat.
The second condition listed, constant speed, is required in order to avoid pitch variations, or &ldquo;wow.&rdquo;
The third requirement, lack of extraneous vibrations, keeps low-frequency noise called &ldquo;rumble&rdquo; out of the final sound.


The groove variations are sensed by the needle, or stylus, which in highquality systems is jewel tipped; it is usually diamond.
The needle must have an unmarred, smooth surfaced, hard tip, normally of spherical shape.


The pickup is an electric generator (usually either of the piezo-electric, variable reluctance, or moving-coil type) whose function is to translate the mechanical vibrations of the needle into electrical oscillations of the same wave form.
It must do this with minimum distortion of the wave form, and must not allow resonances of its own to influence its output voltage significantly.
It is also an advantage for the pickup to impose as little work as possible on the needle.
The greater the force required for the groove to displace the needle from side to side, the greater the vertical bearing force will have to be to maintain proper and constant stylus groove contact, and the greater the wear of both record and needle.

<figure>
\label{fig:3-4}
\caption{Diagram of a complete monaural •ound reproducing system.}

The tone arm holds the pickup in place over the groove, and must provide sufficient freedom of motion so that the pressure of the groove walls alone can make the needle move across the record, following the recorded spiral.
It must also be free enough to follow warp and eccentricity of the disc easily.
The tone arm must hold the pickup approximately tangent to the groove being played, must provide the proper vertical force for the pickup, and must not allow its own resonant behavior to influence the system.

The electrical output of one type of pickup, the piezo-electric, is usually fed directly to the amplifier.
It is of the order of V2 volt or more, and is a fairly accurate replica of the recorded sound. 
This is so because the characteristic frequency response of the pickup is more or less the inverse image of the frequency characteristics &ldquo;built in&rdquo; to the record.
(This last subject will be taken up in detail later.)

The reluctance and moving-coil pickups, however, produce a much smaller amount of electrical energy.
The output voltage of these pickups (which are classed together as magnetic types) may be as low as a few thousandths of a volt.
Furthermore the characteristic frequency response of the magnetic pickup does not compensate for the way in which the frequency characteristics of the recorded sound has been doctored.
Therefore the pickup output must be passed through a preamplifier before it enters the amplifier proper.


The preamplifier is normally combined with the main amplifier control sections (volume and tone controls).
Its functions are to increase the output voltage of the pickup, and to compensate accurately for the frequency characteristics of the record so that the sound is not deficient in bass and heavy in the treble.
Since different record companies have made records with different characteristics the preamplifier may allow the operator to choose between several types of frequency compensation.
The need for such control, which is called variable record equalization, has disappeared with modem records, which are standardized on the RIAA recording characteristic.


The control section of the amplifier allows the operator to regulate the volume, and, in most cases, to either accentuate or attenuate (&ldquo;boost&rdquo; or &ldquo;cut&rdquo;) the bass and treble portions of the reproduced sound independently.
The primary function of tone control is to compensate for deficiencies in associated equipment or program material, and to compensate for acoustical conditions of the room in which the music is heard.
When the control section and phonograph preamplifier are combined on one chassis, the entire unit is commonly referred to as a preamplifier.


The power amplifier receives the electrical signal as it is finally shaped, and releases another signal, ideally identical in all respects except power.
The power amplification may be tens of millions of times, from a fraction of a microwatt (one millionth of a watt) to dozens of watts.


Although the demands on the amplifier are very great, and although it appears to be the most complicated of the system components, it is the least imperfect of these components.
The percentages of harmonic and intermodulation distortion, the irregularities of frequency response, and the extraneous noise introduced by an amplifier built according to the best current design practice, and without regard for cost, are such that they are not limiting factors in the fidelity of the reproduced sound.


The final component of the sound system is the loudspeaker system, which consists of the speaker mechanism itself and the speaker enclosure.
The loudspeaker converts the alternating electrical output of the amplifier into mechanical vibrations of a cone or diaphragm.
But the cone vibrating by itself cannot, for reasons that will be discussed further on, produce adequate bass energy.
It must be mounted in an enclosure or baffle of some sort, which gives the vibrating surface the &ldquo;bite&rdquo; of air that it needs to radiate low-frequency sound.


The speaker and its enclosure, like the amplifier, should introduce as little distortion and frequency irregularity into the signal as possible.
Typical speaker deficiencies are irregular frequency response, poor transient response (hangover), and harmonic and intermodulation distortion.


Two other components are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:3-4}.
The tuner is a device which converts AM or FM radio signals to audio signals that can be handled by the audio amplifier; the tape transport mechanism, with its associated preamplifier, provides a signal of the same nature as that coming from the tuner or phonograph pickup.

Fig. \ref{fig:3-5} shows the basic elements of a stereo reproducing system.
The stereo tape mechanism has two heads which independently reproduce each channel that is recorded in parallel on the tape; the stereo pickup provides two separate output signals from the two channels recorded in the groove (the turntable and pickup arm do not have to be duplicated); the stereo tuner receives the &ldquo;multiplex&rdquo; FM stereo signal and separates it into two separate channels, which it feeds independently to each of the control units.
Each control unit and each power output is shown duplicated, The two control units and power amplifiers may be separate, or they may be combined on one chassis, or all four units may be combined on one chassis, but in any case they must provide independent amplification for each channel.
