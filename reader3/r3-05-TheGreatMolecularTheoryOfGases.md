Newton&#39;s theory of universal gravitation was a world-wide success.
His book, the Principia, ran into three editions in his lifetime and popular studies of it were the fashion in the courts of Europe.
Voltaire wrote an exposition of the Principia for the general reader; books were even published on &ldquo;Newton&#39;s Theory expounded to Ladies.&rdquo;
Newton&#39;s theory impressed educated people not only as a brilliant ordering of celestial Nature but as a model for other grand explanations yet to come.
We consider Newton&#39;s theory a good one because it is simple and productive and links together many different phenomena, giving a general feeling of understanding.
The theory is simple because its basic assumptions are a few clear statements.
This simplicity is not spoiled by the fact that some of the deductions need difficult mathematics.
The success of Newton&#39;s planetary theory led to attempts at more theories similarly based on the laws of motion.
For example, gases seem simple in behavior.
Could not some theory of gases be constructed, to account for Boyle&#39;s Law by &ldquo;predicting&rdquo; it, and to make other predictions and increase our general understanding?


Such attempts led to a great molecular theory of gases.
As in most great inventions the essential discovery is a single idea which seems simple enough once it is thought of: the idea that gas pressure is due to bombardment by tiny moving particles, the &ldquo;molecules&rdquo; of gas.
Gases have simple common properties.
They always fill their container and exert a uniform pressure all over its top, bottom, and sides, unlike solids and liquids.
At constant temperature, <span class="textsc">Pressure</span> &middot; <span class="textsc">Volume</span> remains constant, however the gas is compressed or expanded.
Heating a gas increases its pressure or volume or both&mdash;and the rate of increase with temperature is the same for all gases (&ldquo;Charles&#39; Law&rdquo;).
Gases move easily, diffuse among each other and seep through porous walls.


Could these properties be &ldquo;explained&rdquo; in terms of some mechanical pictvire?
Newton&#39;s contemporaries revived the Greek philosophers' idea of matter being made of &ldquo;fiery atoms&rdquo; in constant motion.
Now, with a good system of mechanics they could treat such a picture realistically and ask what &ldquo;atoms&rdquo; would do.
The most striking general property that a theory should explain was Boyle&#39;s Law.


## Boyle&#39;s Law

In 1661 Boyle announced his discovery, &ldquo;not without delight and satisfaction&rdquo; that the pressures and volumes of air are &ldquo;in reciprocal proportions.&rdquo;
That was his way of saying: <span class="textsc">pressure</span> &sim; 1/<span class="textsc">volume</span> or <span class="textsc">pressure</span> &middot; <span class="textsc">volume</span> remains constant, when air is compressed.
It was well known that air expands when heated, so the restriction &ldquo;at constant temperature&rdquo; was obviously necessary for this simple law.
This was Boyle&#39;s discovery of the &ldquo;spring of the air&rdquo;&mdash;a spring of variable strength compared with sohd Hooke's Law springs.

In laboratory you should try a &ldquo;Boyle&#39;s-Law experiment&rdquo; with a sample of dry air, not to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; a law that you already know, but as a problem in precision, &ldquo;your skill against nature.&rdquo;
You will be limited to a small range of pressures (say 1/2 atmosphere to 2 atm.) and your accuracy may be sabotaged by the room temperature changing or by a slight taper in the glass tube that contains the sample.
\footnote{
    Even modern glass tubing is slightly tapered, unless made uniform by an expensive process;
        so when experiments &ldquo;to verify Boyle&#39;s Law&rdquo; show deviations from pV = constant they are usually exhibiting tube-taper rather than misbehavior of air.
    If the air sample is replaced by certain other gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>, or by some organic vapor, real deviations from Boyle&#39;s Law become obvious and interesting.
    See Ch. 30.
}
If you plot your measurements on a graph showing pressube vs. volume you will find they mark a hyperbola&mdash;but that is too difficult a curve to recognize for sure and claim as verification of Boyle&#39;s Law.
\footnote{The only safe shapes of graphs for testing a law, or finding one, are straight lines and circles.}
Then plot <span class="textsc">pressure</span> <em>vs</em>. 1/<span class="textsc">volume</span> and look for a straight line through the origin.


<figure>
\label{fig:25-1}
\caption{Boyle&#39;s Law}
</figure>


Boyle&#39;s measurements were fairly rough and extended only from a fraction of an atmosphere to about 4 atm.
If you make precise measurements with air you will find that pV changes by only a few tenths of 1 percent at most, over that range.
Your graph of <span class="math">p</span> <em>vs</em>. 1/<span class="textsc">V</span> will show your experimental points very close to a straight line through the origin.
Since mass/volume is density and mass is constant, values of 1/<span class="textsc">V</span> represent density, and Boyle&#39;s Law says

<figcaption>
    Boyle&#39;s Law Isothermals
</figcaption>
</figure>


<span class="textsc">pressure</span> &sim; <span class="textsc">density</span>.
This makes sense on many a simple theory of gas molecules: &ldquo;put twice as many molecules in a box and you will double the pressure.&rdquo;
All the measurements on a Boyle&#39;s-Law graph line are made at the same temperature: it is an isothermal line.
Of course we can draw several isothermals on one diagram, as in [Figure 25-2](#fig25-2).


If the range of pressure is increased, larger deviations appear&mdash;Boyle&#39;s simple law is only an approximate account of real gas behavior.
It fits well at low pressures but not at high pressures when the sample is crowded to high density.
[Figure 25-3](#fig25-3) shows the experimental facts for larger pressures, up to 3000 atmospheres.
(For graphs of CO<sub>2</sub>&#39;s behavior, including liquefaction, see Ch. 30.)

## Theory

Boyle tried to guess at a mechanism underlying his experimental law.
As a good chemist, he pictured tiny atomic particles as the responsible agents.
He suggested that gas particles might be springy, like little balls of curly wool piled together, resisting compression.
Newton placed gas particles farther apart, and calculated a law of repulsion-force to account for Boyle&#39;s Law.
D. Bernoulli published a bombardment theory, without special force-laws, that predicted Boyle&#39;s Law.
He pointed out that moving particles would produce pressure by bombarding the container; and he suggested that heating air must make its particles move faster.
This was the real beginning of our present theory.
He made a brave attempt, but his account was incomplete.
A centiry later, in the 1840&#39;s, Joule and others set forth a successful &ldquo;Kinetic theory of gases,&rdquo; on this simple basic view:


<blockquote>
A gas consists of small elastic particles in rapid motion: and the pressure on the walls is simply the effect of bombardment.
</blockquote>


Joule showed that this would &ldquo;explain&rdquo; Boyle&#39;s Law, and that it would yield important information about the gas particles themselves.
This was soon polished by mathematicians and physicists into a large, powerful theory, capable of enriching our understanding.


In modern theories, we call the moving particles molecules, a name borrowed from chemistry, where it means the smallest particle of a substance that exists freely.
Split a molecule and you have separate atoms, which may have quite different properties from the original substance.
A molecule of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, split into atoms yields two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, quite difiFerent from the particles or molecules of water.
Left alone, these separated atoms gang up in pairs, H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>&mdash;molecules of hydrogen and oxygen gas.
In kinetic theory, we deal with the complete molecules, and assume they are not broken up by collisions.
And we assume the molecules exert no forces on each other except during collisions; and then, when they are very close, they exert strong repulsive forces for a very short time: in fact that is all a collision is.

You yourself have the necessary tools for constructing a molecular theory of gases.
Try it.
Assume that gas pressure is due to molecules bouncing elastically on the containing walls.
Carry out the first stages by working through Problems 1 and 2.
They start with a bouncing ball and graduate to many bouncing molecules, to emerge with a prediction of the behavior of gases.
After you have tried the problems, return to the discussion of details.

## Difficulties of the Simple Theory


The relation you worked out in Problem 2 seems to predict a steady pressure and Boyle&#39;s-Law behavior, from molecular chaos.
How can a rain of molecules hitting a wall make a steady pressure?
Only if the collisions come in such rapid succession that their bumps seem to smooth out into a constant force.

<figure id="fig25-6">
<figcaption>
Smoothing Out Impacts
</figcaption>
</figure>

For that the molecules of a gas must be exceedingly numerous, and very small.
If they are small any solid pressure-gauge or container wall will be enormously massive compared with a single gas molecule, so that, as impacts bring it momentum, it will smooth them out to the steady pressure we observe.
(What would you expect if the container wall were as hght as a few molecules?)

The problem pretended that molecules travel straight from end to end and never collide with each other en route.
They certainly do collide&mdash;though we cannot say how often without further information.
How will that affect the prediction?

### Problem 3. Collisions In Simple Theory

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that It does not matter, in the simple derivation of Problems 1 and 2, whether molecules collide or not.
        (Consider two molecules moving to and fro from end to end, just missing each other as they cross.
        Then suppose they collide head-on and rebound. Why will their contribution to the pressure be unchanged? Explain with a diagram.)
    \item What special assumption about molecules is required for (a)?
    \item Suppose the molecules swelled up and became very bulky (but kept the some speed, mass, etc.), would the effect of mutual collisions be an increase of pressure (for the same volume etc.) or a decrease or whot?
        (Note: &ldquo;bulky&rdquo; means large in size, not necessarily large in mass.)
    \item Give a clear reason for your answer to (c).
\end{enumerate}

## Molecular Chaos

Molecules hitting each other, and the walls, at random&mdash;some head on, some obliquelv, some glancing&mdash;cannot all keep the some speed <span class="math">v</span>.
One will gain in a collision, and another lose, so that the gas is a chaos of molecules with random motions whose speeds (changing at every collision) cover a wide range.
Yet they must preserve some constancy, because a gas exerts a steady pressure.

%% TODO
In the prediction <span class="math">p &middot; V= 1/3 [ N m v<sup>2</sup> ]</span>, we do not have all <span class="math">N</span> moleciiles moving with the same speed, each contributing $m\bar{v^2}$ inside the brackets.
Instead we have molecule \textnumero{}1 with its speed <span class="math">v<sub>1</sub></span>, molecule \textnumero{}2 with <span class="math">v<sub>2</sub></span>, &hellip; , molecule <span class="math">N</span> with speed <span class="math">v_N</span>.
Then

\begin{align}
    p \cdot V &= \frac{1}{3} \left[ mv_1^2 + mv_2^2 + \cdots + mv_N^2 \right] \\
              &= \frac{1}{3} \left[ m\left( v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_N^2 \right) \right] \\
              &= \frac{1}{3} \left[ m\left( N \cdot<span class="textsc">Average</span> v^2 \right) \right] \\
              &\hfill <span class="textsc">See note 3</span> \\
\end{align}

The $v^2$* in our prediction must therefore be an average v<sup>2</sup>,
    so that we write a bar over it to show it is an average value.
Our theoretical prediction now runs:

\begin{equation}
    <span class="textsc">Presssure</span> \cdot <span class="textsc">VOLume</span> = \frac{1}{3} N \cdot m \cdot \bar{v^2}.
\end{equation}

We know that if we keep a gas in a closed bottle its pressiure does not jump up and down as time goes on; its pressiire and volume stay constant.
Therefore in spite of all the changes in coUisions, the molecular $\bar{v^2}$ stays constant.
Already our theory helps us to picture some order&mdash;constant $\bar{v^2}$&mdash;among molecular chaos.


## A More Elegant Derivation


To most scientists the regimentation that leads to the factor 1/3 is too artificial a trick.
Here is a more elegant method that treats the molecules&#39; random velocities honestly with simple statistics.
Suppose molecule \textnumero{}1 is moving in a slanting direction in the box, with velocity <span class="math">v_1</span>.
(See Fig. 25-7.) Resolve this vector <span class="math">v_1</span> into three

<figure>
\label{fig:25-7}
\caption{
    <span class="textsc">Alternative Treatment of Gas Molecule Motion</span>
    (More professional, less artificial.)
    In this we keep the random velocities, avoiding regimentation, but split each velocity <span class="math">v</span> into three components, <span class="math">v_x</span>, <span class="math">v_y</span>, <span class="math">v_z</span>, parallel to the sides of the box.
    Then we deal with $v_x^2$ in calculating the pressure and arrive at the same result.
    Sketches show three molecules with velocities split into components.
}
</figure>

components along directions <span class="math">x</span>, <span class="math">y</span>, <span class="math">z</span>, parallel to the edges of the box.
Then <span class="math">v_1</span> is the resultant of $v_{1x}$ along <span class="math">x</span> and $v_{1y}$ along <span class="math">y</span> and $v_{1z}$ along <span class="math">z</span>;
    and since these are mutually perpendicular, we have, by the three-dimensional form

%    Because average $v^2 = (\text{sum of all the $v^2$ values})/(\text{number of $v^2$ values}) = (V_1^2 + v_2^2 + &hellip; + v_N^2)/(N)$
%    $\therefore (v_1^2 + v_2^2 + &hellip; + v_N^2) = N \cdot (<span class="textsc">Average</span> v^2) \text{or} N\cdot\bar{v^2}$

of Pythagoras&#39; theorem: $v_1^2 = v_{1x}^2 + v_{1y}^2 + v_{1z}^2$
And for molecule \textnumero{}2 $v_2^2 = v_{2x}^2 + v_{2y}^2 + v_{2z}^2$
And for molecule \textnumero{}3 $v_3^2 = v_{3x}^2 + v_{3y}^2 + v_{3z}^2$
and so on
And for molecule \textnumero{}N $v_N^2 = v_{Nx}^2 + v_{Ny}^2 + v_{Nz}^2$

Add all these equations:
\begin{align}
    & \left( v_1^2 + v_{2}^2 + &hellip; + v_{N}^2 \right) \\
    &\quad = \left( v_{1x}^2 + v_{2x}^2 + &hellip; + v_{Nx}^2 \right) \\
    &\quad + \left( v_{1y}^2 + v_{2y}^2 + &hellip; + v_{Ny}^2 \right) \\
    &\quad + \left( v_{1z}^2 + v_{2z}^2 + &hellip; + v_{Nz}^2 \right)
\end{align}

Divide by the number of molecules, <span class="math">N</span>, to get average values:

\begin{equation}
    \therefore \bar{v}^2 = \bar{v_x^2} + \bar{v_{y}^2} + \bar{v_x^2}
\end{equation}


Appealing to symmetry, and ignoring the small bias given by gravity, we claim that the three averages on the right are equal&mdash;the random motions of a statistically large number of molecules should have the same distribution of velocities in any direction. 
To predict the pressure on the end of the box we proceed as in Problem 2, but we use <span class="math">v_x</span> for a molecule&#39;s velocity along the length of the box.
(That is the velocity we need, because <span class="math">v_y</span> and <span class="math">v_z</span> do not help the motion from end to end and are not involved in the change of momentum at each end.)
Then the contribution of molecule \textnumero{}1 to $<span class="textsc">pressure</span>\cdot<span class="textsc">volume</span>$ is $m\cdot v_{1x}^2$ and the contribution of all <span class="math">N</span> molecules is

\begin{equation}
    m \left( v_{1x}^2 + v_{2x}^2 + &hellip; v_{Nx}^2 \right) \quad or\quad m\cdot N\cdot \bar{v_x^2}
\end{equation}

and by the argument above this is $m\cdot N\cdot \bar{v_x^2}$;

\begin{equation}
    \therefore <span class="textsc">pressure</span>\cdot<span class="textsc">volume</span> = \frac{1}{3} N \cdot m \cdot \bar{v_x^2}
\end{equation}

(If you adopt this derivation, you should carry through the algebra of number of hits in <span class="math">t</span> secs, etc., as in Problem 2.)

## Molecular Theory&#39;s Predictions

Thinking about molecular collisions and using Newton&#39;s Laws gave the $\frac{1}{3} N \cdot m \cdot \bar{v^2}$ prediction:

\begin{equation}
    <span class="textsc">pressure</span> \cdot <span class="textsc">volume</span> = \frac{1}{3} N \cdot m \cdot \bar{v^2}
\end{equation}

This looks like a prediction of Boyle&#39;s Law.
The fraction ($\frac{1}{3}$) is a constant number; <span class="math">N</span>, the number of molecules, is constant, unless they leak out or split up;
    <span class="math">m</span>, the mass of a molecule, is constant.
Then if the average speed remains unchanged, $\frac{1}{3} N \cdot m \cdot \bar{v^2}$
    remains constant and therefore $p\cdot V$ should remain constant, as Boyle found it does.
But does the speed of molecules remain fixed?
At this stage, you have no guarantee.
For the moment, anticipate later discussion and assume that molecular motion is connected with the heat-content of a gas, and that at constant temperature gas molecules keep a constant average speed, the same speed however much the gas is compressed or rarefied.
\footnote{
    Actually, compressing a gas warms it, but we believe that when it cools back to its original temperature its molecules, though still crowded close, return to the same average speed as before compression.
}

Later you will receive clear reasons for believing this.
If you accept it now,
you have predicted that:

<blockquote>
    The product $p\cdot V$ is constant for a gas at constant temperature.
</blockquote>

You can see the prediction in simplest form by considering changes of densfty instead of volume:
    just put twice as many molecules in the same box, and the pressure will be doubled.


A marvelous prediction of Boyle&#39;s Law?
Hardly marvelous: we had to pour in many assumptions&mdash;wdth a careful eye on the desired result, we could scarcely help choosing wisely.
A theory that gathers assumptions and predicts only one already-known law&mdash;and that under a further assumption regarding temperature&mdash;would not be worth keeping.
But our new theory is just beginning: it is also helpful in &ldquo;explaining&rdquo; evaporation, diffusion, gas friction; it predicts effects of sudden compression; it makes vacuum-pumps easier to design and understand.
And it leads to measurements that give validity to its owTi assumptions.
Before discussing the development, we ask a basic question, &ldquo;Are there really any such things as molecules?&rdquo;


<em>Are there really molecules?</em>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;That&#39;s the worst of circumstantial evidence.
The prosecuting attorney has at his command all the facilities of organized investigation.
He uncovers facts.
He selects only those which, in his opinion, are significant.
Once he&#39;s come to the conclusion the defendant is guilty, the only facts he considers significant are those which point to the guilt of the defendant.
That&#39;s why circumstantial evidence is such a liar.
Facts themselves are meaningless.
It&#39;s onlv the interpretation we give those facts which counts.&rdquo;

</blockquote>


A century ago, molecules seemed useful: a helpful concept that made the regularities of chemical combinations easy to understand and provided a good start for a simple theory of gases.
But did they really exist?
There was only circumstantial evidence tliat made the idea plausible.
Many scientists were skeptical, and at least one great chemist maintained his riglit to disbelieve in molecules and atoms even until the beginning of this century.
Yet one piece of experimental evidence appeared quite early, about 1827; the Brownian motion.


## The Brownian Motion


The Scottish botanist Robert Brown (1773-1858) made an amazing discovery: he practically saw molecular motion.
Looking tlrrough his microscope at small specks of soUd suspended in water, he saw them dancing with an incessant jigging motion.
The microscopic dance made the specks look alive, but it never stopped day after day.
Heating made the dance more furious, but on cooling it returned to its original scale.
We now know that any solid specks in any fluid will show such a dance, the smaller the speck the faster the dance, a random motion with no rhyme or reason.
Brown was in fact watching the effects of water molecules jostling the solid specks.
The specks were being pushed around like an elephant in the midst of a football game.


Watch this &ldquo;Brownian motion&rdquo; for yourself.
Look at small specks of soot in water (&ldquo;India ink&rdquo;) with a high-magnification microscope.
More easily, look at smoke in air with a low-power microscope.
Fill a small black box with smoke from a cigarette or a dying match, and illuminate it with strong white light from the side.
The smoke scatters bluish-white light in all directions, some of it upward into the microscope.
The microscope shows the smoke as a crowd of tiny specks of white ash which dance about with an entirely irregular motion.
\footnote{
    There may also be general drifting motions&mdash;convection currents&mdash;but these are easily distingiiished.
    An ash speck in focus shows as a small sharp wisp of white, often oblong; but when it drifts or dances away out of focus the microscope shows it as a fuzzy round blob, just as camera pictures show distant street lights out of focus.
} (See Fig.  30-3 for an example)


Watching the ash specks, you can see why Brown at first thought he saw Uving things moving, but you can well imagine the motion to be due to chance bombardment by air molecules.
Nowadays we not only think it may be that; we are sure it is, because we can calculate the effects of such bombardment and check them with observation.
If air molecules were infinitely small and infinitely numerous, they would bombard a big speck symmetrically from all sides and there would be no Brownian motion to see.
At the other extreme, if there were only a few very big molecules of surrounding air, the ash speck would make great violent jumps when it did get hit.
From what we see, we infer something between these extremes; there must be many molecules in the box, hitting the ash speck from all sides, many times a second.
In a short time, many hundreds of molecules hit the ash speck from every direction; and occasionally a few hundreds more hit one side of it than the other and drive it noticeably in one direction.
A big jump is rare, but several tiny random motions in the same general direction may pile up into a visible shift.
\footnote{
    Imagine an observer with poor sight tracing the motion of an active guest at a crowded party.
    He might fail to see the guest&#39;s detailed motion of small steps here and there, and yet after a while he would notice that the guest had wandered a considerable distance.
}
Detailed watching and calculation from later knowledge tell us that what we see under the microscope are those gross resultant shifts; but, though the individual movements are too small to see, we can still estimate their speed by cataloguing the gross staggers and analysing them statistically.

You can see for yourself that smaller specks dance faster.
Now carry out an imaginary extrapolation to smaller and smaller specks.
Then what motion would you expect to see with specks as small as molecules if you could see them?
But can we see molecules?

### Seeing molecules?

Could we actually see a molecule?
That would indeed be convincing&mdash;we feel sure that what we see is real, despite many an optical illusion.
All through the last century&#39;s questioning of molecules, scientists agreed that seeing one is hopeless&mdash;not just unlikely but impossible, for a sound physical reason.
Seeing uses light, which consists of waves of very short wavelength, only a few thousand Angstrom Units
\footnote{
    I Angstrom Unit, 1 &Aring;, is $10^{-10}$ meter.
}
from crest to crest.
We see by using these waves to form an image: with the naked eye we can see the shape of a pin&#39;s head, a millimeter across, or 10,000,000 &Aring; with a magnifying glass we examine a fine hair, 1,000,000 &Aring; thick with a low-power microscope we see a speck of smoke ash, 100,000 &Aring; with a high-power microscope, we see bacteria, from 10,000 down to 1,000 &Aring; but there the sequence stops.
It must stop because the wavelength of visible light sets a limit there.
Waves can make clear patterns of obstacles that are larger than their wavelength, or even about their wavelength in size.
For example, ocean waves sweeping past an island show a clear &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; of calm beyond.
But waves treat smaller obstacles quite differently.
Ocean waves meeting a small wooden post show no calm behind.
They just lollop around the post and join up beyond it as if there were no post there.
A blind man paddling along a stormy seashore could infer the presence of an island nearby, but would never know about a small post just offshore from him.
\footnote{
    Tiny obstacles do produce a small scattered ripple, but this tells nothing about their shape.
    Bluish light scattered by very fine smoke simply indicates there are very tiny specks there, but does not say whether they are round or sharp-pointed or oblong.
    The still more bluish light of the sky is sunlight scattered by air molecules.
}
Light waves range in wavelength from 7,000 &Aring; for red to 4,000 &Aring; for violet.
An excursion into the short-wave ultraviolet, with photographic film instead of an eye, is brought to a stop by absorption before wavelength 1,000 &Aring;:
    lenses, specimen, even the air itself, are &ldquo;black&rdquo; for extreme ultraviolet light.
X-rays, with shorter wavelength still, can pass through matter and show grey shadows, but they practically cannot be focused by lenses.
So, although X-rays have the much shorter wavelength that could pry into much finer structures, they give us only unmagnified shadow pictures.
Therefore the limit imposed by light&#39;s wavelength seemed impassable.
Bacteria down to 1,000 &Aring; could be seen, but virus particles, ten times smaller, must remain invisible.
And molecules, ten times smaller still, must be far beyond hope.
Yet viruses, responsible for many diseases, are of intense medical interest&mdash;we now think they may mark the borderhne between living organisms and plain chemical molecules.
And many basic questions of chemistry might be answered by seeing molecules.


The invisibility of molecules was unwelcome, but seemed inescapable.
Then, early in this century, X-rays offered indirect information.
The well-ordered atoms and molecules of crystals can scatter X-rays into regular patterns, just as woven cloth can &ldquo;diffract&rdquo; light into regular patterns&mdash;look at a distant lamp at night through a fine handkerchief or an umbrella. X-ray patterns revealed both the arrangement of atoms in crystals and the spacing of their layers.
Such measurements confirmed the oil-film estimates of molecular size.
More recently, these X-ray diffraction-splash pictures have sketched the general shape of some big molecules&mdash;really only details of crystal structure, but still a good hint of molecular shape.
Then when physicists still cried &ldquo;no hope&rdquo; the electron microscope was invented.
Streams of electrons, instead of light-waves, pass through the tiny object under examination, and are focused by electric or magnetic fields to form a greatly magnified image on a photographic film.
Electrons are incomparably smaller agents than light-waves,
\footnote{
Electrons speeding through the electron microscope behave as if they too have a wavelength, but far shorter than the wavelength of light.
So they offer new possibilities of &ldquo;vision,&rdquo; whether you regard them as minute bullets smaller than atoms, or as ultra-short wave patterns.
A technology of &ldquo;electron optics&rdquo; has developed, with &ldquo;lenses&rdquo; for electron microscopes and for television tubes (which are electron projection-lanterns).
}
so small that even &ldquo;molecules&rdquo; can be dehneated.
Then we can &ldquo;see&rdquo; virus particles and even big molecules in what seem to be reliable photographs with huge magnifications.
These new glimpses of molecular structure agree well with the speculative pictures drawn by chemists arguing very cleverly from chemical behavior.


Recendy, still sharper methods have been developed.
At the end of this book you will see a picture of the individual atoms of metal in a needle point.
Why not show that now?
Because, like so much in atomic physics, the method needs a sophisticated knowledge of assumptions as well as techniques before you can decide in what sense the photograph tells the truth.
Going still deeper, very-high-energy electrons are now being used to probe the structure of atomic nuclei, yielding indirect shadow pictures of them.


In the last 100 years, molecules have graduated from being tiny uncounted agents in a speculative theory to being so real that we even expect to &ldquo;see&rdquo; their shape.
Most of the things we know about them&mdash;speed, number, mass, size&mdash;were obtained a century ago with the help of kinetic theory.
<em>The theory promoted the measurements, then the measurements gave validity to the theory.</em>
We shall now leave dreams of seeing molecules, and study what we can measure by simple experiments.


## Measuring the Speed of Molecules

Returning to our prediction that:
\begin{equation}
    <span class="textsc">pressure</span>\cdot<span class="textsc">volume</span> = \frac{1}{3} \cdot M \cdot \bar{v^2}
\end{equation}

We can use this if we trust it, to estimate the actual speed of the molecules.
<span class="math">N</span> is the number of molecules and <span class="math">m</span> is the mass of one molecule so <span class="math">Nm</span> is the total mass M of all the molecules in the box of gas. Then
we can rewrite our prediction:
\begin{equation}
    <span class="textsc">pressure</span>\cdot<span class="textsc">volume</span> = \frac{1}{3} \cdot M \cdot \bar{v^2}
\end{equation}

where <span class="math">M</span> is the total mass of gas.
We can weigh a big sample of gas with measured volume at known pressure and substitute our measurements in the relation above to find the value of $\bar{v^2}$ and thus the value of the average speed. 

Fig. 25-9 shows the necessary measurements.
Using the ordinary air of the room, we measure its pressure by a mercury barometer.
(Barometer height and the measured density of mercury and the measured value of the Earth&#39;s gravitational field strength, 9.8 newtons per kilogram, will give the pressure in absolute units, newtons per square meter.)
\footnote{
    Since we made our kinetic theory prediction with the help of Newton&#39;s Law II, the predicted force must be in absolute units, newtons; and the predicted pressure must be in newtons per square meter.
}
We weigh the air which fills a flask.
For this, we weigh the flask first full of air at atmospheric pressure and second after a vacuum pump has taken out nearly all the air.
Then we open the flask under water and let water enter to replace the air pumped out.

<figure>
\label{fig:25-9}
\caption{Measuring Molecule Velocities Indirectly Simply, Assuming Kinetic Theory}
</figure>

Measuring the volume of water that enters the flask tells us the volume of air which has a known mass.
%% TODO
%Inserting these measurements in the predicted relation we calculate $\bar{v^2}$ and thence its square root $\sqrt{\bar{v^2}}$ which we may call the &ldquo;average speed,&rdquo; x&gt; (or more strictly the &ldquo;root mean square,&rdquo; or R.M.S.  speed).
You should see these measurements made and calculate the velocity, as in the following problem.

### Problem 4. Speed of Oxygen Molecules

Experiment shows that 32 kilogram of oxygen occupy 24 meter cubed at atmospheric pressure, at room temperature.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the density, $<span class="textsc">MASS</span>/<span class="textsc">Volume</span>$, of oxygen.
    \item Using the relation given by kinetic theory, calculate the mean square velocity, $v^2$, of the molecules.
    \item Take the square root and find an &ldquo;average&rdquo; velocity, in meters/sec.
    \item Also express this very roughly in miles/hour.
        (Take 1 kilometer to be $\frac{5}{8}$ mile)
\end{enumerate}

Air molecules moving $\frac{1}{4}$ mile per second!
Here is theory being fruitful and validating its own assumption, as theory should.
We assumed that gases consist of molecules that are moving, probably moving fast; and our theory now tells us how fast, with the help of simple gross measurements.
Yet theory cannot prove its own prediction is true&mdash;the result can only be true to the assumptions that went in.
So we need experimental tests.
If the theory passes one or two tests, we may trust its further predictions.

## Speed of Molecules: experimental evidence

We have rough hints from the speed of sound and from the Brownian motion.

### Problem 5. Speed of Sound

We believe that sound is carried by waves of compression and rarefaction, with the changes of crowding and motion handed on from molecule to molecule at collisions.
If air does consist of moving molecules far apart, what can you say about molecular speed, given that the measured speed of sound in air is 340 meter per second ($\approx 1,100$ feet per second)?

### Problem 6. Brownian Motion

Looking at smoke under a microscope you will see large specks of ash jigging quite fast; small specks jig faster still.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There may be specks too small to see.
        What motion would you expect them to hove?
    \item Regarding o single air molecule as an even smaller &ldquo;ash speck,&rdquo; what can you state about its motion?
\end{enumerate}

The two problems above merely suggest general guesses.
Here is a demonstration that shows that gas molecules move very fast.
Liquid bromine is released at the bottom of a tall glass tube.
\footnote{
    The bromine is inserted as liquid bromine in a small glass capsule with a long nose that can be broken easily.
}

<figure>
\label{fig:25-10}
\caption{Motion of Bromine Molecules: Demonstration of Molecular Speed.}
</figure>


The liquid evaporates immediately to a brown vapor or &ldquo;gas,&rdquo; which slowly spreads throughout the tube.
The experiment is repeated in a tube from which all air has been pumped out.
Now the brown gas moves very fast when released.
(In air, its molecules still move fast, but their net progress is slow because of many collisions with air molecules.)

## Direct Measurement

The real test must be a direct measurement.
Molecular speeds have been measured by several experimenters.
Here is a typical experiment, done by Zartman.
He let a stream of molecules shoot through a slit in the side of a cylindrical drum that could be spun rapidly.
The molecules were of bismuth metal, boiled off molten liquid in a tiny oven in a vacuum.
A series of barriers with slits selected a narrow stream to hit the drum.
Then each time the slit in the drum came around, it admitted a small flock of moving molecules.
With the drum at rest, the molecules travelled across to the opposite wall inside the drum and made a mark on a receiving film opposite the slit.
With the drum spinning, the film was carried around an appreciable distance while the molecules were travelling across to it, and the mark on it was shifted to a new position.
The molecules&#39; velocity could be calculated from the shift of the mark and the drum's diameter and spinspeed.
When the recording film was taken out of the drum it showed a sharp central mark of deposited metal but the mark made while it spun was smeared out into a blur showing that the molecular velocities had not all been the same but were spread over a considerable range.
Gas molecules have random motion with frequent collisions and we must expect to find a great variety of velocities at any instant.
It is the average velocity, or rather the root-mean-square average, $\sqrt{v^2}$, that is involved in kinetic theory prediction.
The probable distribution of velocities, clustering round that average, can be predicted by extending simple kinetic theory with the help of the mathematical statistics of chance.
In Zartman&#39;s experiment, we e-xpect the beam of hot vapor molecules to have the same chance distribution of velocities with its peak at an average value characteristic of the temperature.
Measurements of the actual darkening of the recording film showed just such a distribution and gave an average that

agreed well with the value predicted by simple theory (see sketch of graph in Fig. 25-12).
\footnote{
    Zartman&#39;s method is not limited to this measurement.
    One method of separating uranium 235 used spinning slits, though the uranium atoms were electrically charged and were given high speeds by electric fields.
    And mechanical &ldquo;chopper&rdquo; systems are used to sort out moving neutrons.
    Such choppers operate like traffic lights set for some constant speed.
    The simplest prototype of Zartman&#39;s experiment is the scheme shown in Fig. 8-8 for measuring the speed of a rifle bullet.

Weighing a bottle of hydrogen or helium at atmospheric pressure and room temperature shows these gases are much less dense than air; and carbon dioxide is much more dense.
Then our predic tion $p V = \frac{1}{3} M \bar{v^2}$ tells us that hydrogen and helium molecules move faster than air molecules (at the same temperature), and carbon dioxide molecules slower.
Here are actual values:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabu}{X[l]cc}
    Gas & Measurements at Room Temperature and Atmospheric Pressure \\
        & Volume Mass  \\
hydrogen        & 24 cu. meters & 2.0 kilograms \\
helium          & 24 cu. meters & 4.0 kilograms \\
carbon dioxide  & 24 cu. meters & 44.0 kilograms \\
oxygen          & 24 cu. meters & 32.0 kilograms \\
nitrogen        & 24 cu. meters & 28.0 kilograms \\
air ($\frac{1}{5}$ oxygen $\frac{4}{5}$ nitrogen)
                & 24 cu. meters & 28.0 kilograms \\
\end{tabu}
\end{table}


### Problem 7. Speeds
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If oxygen molecules move about 1 mile per second at room temperature, how fast do hydrogen molecules move?
    \item How does the average speed of helium molecules compare with that of hydrogen molecules at the same temperature? (Give the ratio of &ldquo;average&rdquo; speeds.)
    \item How does the speed of carbon dioxide molecules compare with that of air molecules at the same temperature? (Give the ratio of &ldquo;average&rdquo; speeds.)
\end{enumerate}

### Problem 8

Making a risky guess,
\footnote{
    It is obviously risky, since we ore not considering the mechonism of sound transmission in detail.
    In foct there is an unexpected factor, which is different for helium: the eose with which the gas heats up as sound-compressions pass through.
    This momentary rise of temperoture makes sound compressions travel faster.
    The effect is more pronounced in helium than in air, making the speed of sound 8 percent bigger thon simple comparison with air suggests.
    Kinetic theory con predict this effect of specific heat, telling us that helium must have o smaller heat capacity, for a good atomic molecular reason.
}
say whether you would expect the speed of sound in helium to be the some as in air, or bigger or smaller.
Test your guess by blowing an organ pipe first with air, then with helium (or with carbon dioxide).
Or breathe in helium and then talk, using your mouth and nose cavities as miniature echoing organ pipes.
A change in the speed of sound changes the time taken by sound waves to bounce up and down the pipe, and thus changes the frequency at which sound pulses emerge from the mouth.
And that changes the musical note of the vowel sounds, which rises to higher pitch at higher frequency.


### Problem 9

How would you expect the speed of sound in air to change when the pressure is changed without any change of temperature?
(Try this question with the following data, for air at room temperature: 28.8 kg of air occupy 24 cubic meters at 1 atmosphere pressure; at 2 atmospheres they occupy 1 2 cubic meters.)

## Diffusion

If molecules of different gases have such different speeds, one gas should outstrip another when they diffuse through long narrow pipes.
The pipes must be very long and very narrow so that gas seeps through by the wandering of individual molecules and not in a wholesale rush.
The pores of unglazed pottery make suitable &ldquo;pipes&rdquo; for this.
See Fig. \ref{fig:25-13a}, \ref{fig:25-13b}.
The white jar <span class="math">J</span> has fine pores that run right through its walls.
If it is filled with compressed gas and closed with a stopper <span class="math">S</span>, the gas will slowly leak out through the pores into the atmosphere, as you would expect.
But if the pressure is the same (atmospheric) inside and out you would not expect any leakage even if there are different gases inside and outside.
Yet there are changes, showing the effects of different molecular speeds.
The demonstrations sketched start with air inside the jar and another gas, also at atmospheric pressure, outside.
You see the effects of hydrogen molecules whizzing into the jar faster than air can move out; or of air moving out faster than $CO_2$ molecules crawl in.
These are just qualitative demonstrations of &ldquo;diffusion,&rdquo; but they suggest a process for separating mixed gases. Put a mixture of hydrogen and $CO_2$ inside the jar; then, whether there is air or vacuum outside, the hydrogen will diffuse out faster than the $CO_2$, and by repeating the process in several stages you could obtain almost pure hydrogen.
This is a physical method of separation depending on a difference of molecular speeds that goes with a difference of molecular masses (see Fig. \ref{fig:25-14}.
It does not require a difference of chemical properties; so it can be used to separate &ldquo;isotopes,&rdquo; those twin-brothers that are chemically identical but differ slightly in atomic masses.
When isotopes were first discovered, one neon gas 10 percent denser than the other, some atoms of lead heavier than the rest, they were interesting curiosities, worth trying to separate just to show.
Diffusion of the natural neon mixture from the atmosphere proved the possibility.
But now with two uranium isotopes hopelessly mixed as they come from the mines, one easily fissionable, the other not, the separation of the rare fissionable kind is a matter of prime importance.
Gas diffusion is now used for this on an enormous scale.
See Problem 11, and Figs. \ref{fig:25-15}, \ref{fig:25-16} and \ref{fig:25-17}.
Also see Chs. 30 and 43.

## Temperature

Heating a gas increases <span class="math">p</span> or <span class="math">V</span> or both.
With a rise of temperature there is always an increase of <span class="math">pV</span>, and therefore of $\frac{1}{3} N m \bar{v^2}$.
Therefore making a gas hotter increases $v^2$, makes its molecules move faster.
This suggests some effects of temperature.

### Problem 10

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Would you expect the speed of sound to be greater, less, or the same in air at higher temperature? Explain.
    \item Would you expect diffusion of gases to proceed faster, slower, or at the some rate, at higher temperature? Ex- plain.
\end{enumerate}

## Kinetic Theory To Be Continued

We cannot give more precise answers to such questions until we know more about heat and temperature and energy.
Then we can extract more predictions concerning gas friction, heat conduction, specific heats; and we shall find a way of

<figure>
\label{fig:25-14}
\caption{
    Unequal Diffusion of Gases: Air and carbon dioxide, each originally at atmospheric pressure, are separated by a porous barrier.
    At the start, with equal volumes at the same pressure, the two populations have equal numbers of molecules.
    On the average, air molecules stagger through the pores faster than $CO_2$ molecules.
    Then the populations are no longer equal so the pressures are unequal.

measuring the mass of a single molecule, so that we can count the myriad molecules in a sample of gas.
We shall return to kinetic theory after a study of energy.
Meanwhile, it is kinetic theory that leads us towards energy by asking a question:

## What is $mv^2$?

The expression $\frac{1}{3} N m v^2$ is very important in the study of all gases.
Apart from the fraction $\frac{1}{3}$ it is

<span class="textsc">The Number of Molecules</span> \cdot ($mv^2$ for one molecule)
What is $mv^2$ for a moving molecule?
It is just the mass multiplied by the square of the speed; but what kind of thing does it measure?
What are its properties?
Is it an important member of the series:
    <span class="math">m</span> <span class="math">mv</span> $mv^2$?
We know <span class="math">m</span>, mass, and treat it as a constant thing whose total is universally conserved.
We know <span class="math">mv</span>, momentum, and trust it as a vector that is universally conserved.
Is $mv^2$ equally useful?
Its structure is $mv \cdot v$ or $Ft\cdot v$ or
\begin{equation}
    <span class="textsc">Force</span>\cdot<span class="textsc">Time</span>\cdot <span class="textsc">Distance</span>/<span class="textsc">Time</span>
\end{equation}

Then $mv^2$ is of the form $<span class="textsc">force</span>\cdot<span class="textsc">distance</span>.
Is that product useful?
To push with a force along some distance needs an engine that uses fuel.
Fuel &hellip; money &hellip; energy.
We shall find that <span class="math">mv<sup>2</sup></class> which appears in our theory of gases needs only a constant factor <span clas="math">1/2</span> to make it an expression of &ldquo;energy.&rdquo;

### Problems For Chapter 25

\begin{itemize}
    \item 1. <span class="textsc">Deriving Molecular Pressure</span>

    Work through the question sheets of Problem 1 shown earlier in this chapter.
    These lead up to the use of Newton&#39;s mechanics in a molecular picture of gases.

    \item 2. <span class="textsc">Kinetic Theory With Algebra</span>

    Work through the question sheets of Problem 2.

    Problems 3-10 are in the text of this chapter.

    \item 11. <span class="textsc">Uranium Separation</span> (For more professional version, see Problem 3 in Ch. 30)

    Chemical experiments and arguments show that oxygen molecules contain two atoms so we write them <span class="math">O_2</span>;
        hydrogen molecules have two atoms, written <span class="math">H_2</span>; and the dense vapor of uranium flouride has structure UF<sub>6</sub>. 
    Chemical experiments tell us that the relative masses of single atoms of <span class="math">O</span>, <span class="math">H</span>, <span class="math">F</span>, and <span class="math">U</span> are 16, 1, 19, 238.
    Chemical evidence and a brilliant guess (Avogadro&#39;s) led to the belief that standard volume of any gas at one atmosphere and room temperature contains the same number of molecules whatever the gas (the same for <span class="math">O_2</span>, <span class="math">H_2</span>, or UF<sub>6</sub>).
    Kinetic theory endorses this guess strongly (see Ch. 30).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Looking back to your calculations in Problem 7 you will see that changing from <span class="math">O_2</span> to <span class="math">H_2</span> changes the mass of a molecule in the proportion 32 to 2.
            For the some temperature what change would you expect in the $\bar{v^2}$ and therefore what change in the overage velocity?
            (That is, how fast are hydrogen molecules moving at room temperature compared with oxygen ones? Give a ratio showing the proportion of the new speed to the old.
            Note you do not hove to repeat oil the arithmetic, just consider the one factor that changes.)
        \item Repeat (a) for the change from oxygen to uranium fluoride vapor.
            Do rough Arithmetic to find approximate numerical value.
        \item Actually there ore several kinds of uranium atom.
            The common one has moss 238 (relative to oxygen 16) but a rare one (0.7 percent of the mixture got from rocks) which is in fact the one that undergoes fission, has moss 235.
            One of the (very slow) ways of separating this valuable rare uranium from the common one is by converting the mixture to fluoride and letting the fluoride vapor diffuse through a porous wall.
            Because the fluoride of U<sup>235</sup>F<sub>8</sub> has a different molecular speed the mixture emerging after diffusing through has different proportions,
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Does it become richer or poorer in U<sup>235</sup>?
                \item Give reasons for your answer to (i).
                \item Estimate the percentage difference between average speeds of [U<sup>235<sup><sub>1</sub> F<sub>6</sub>] and [U<sup>236</sup><sub>1</sub> F<sub>6</sub>] molecules.
            \end{enumerate}
            (Note: As discussed in Ch. 1 1 , a change of <span class="math">x</span> percent in some measured quantity <span class="math">Q</span> makes a change of about 1/4% in $\sqrt{Q}$.)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

12. Figs. 25-1 3a and 25-1 3b show two diffusion demonstrations.
Describe what happens and interpret the experiments.

## Molecular View of Compressing Gas

\begin{enumerate}
    \item When on elastic boll hits a massive wall head-on it rebounds with much the same speed as its original speed.
        The some happens when a boll hits a massive bat which is held firmly. However, if the bat is moving towards the ball, the ball rebounds with a different speed.
        Does it move faster or slower?
    \item (Optional, hard: requires careful thought.)
        When the bat is moving towards the boll is the time of the elastic impact longer, shorter, or the some as when the bat is stationary?
        (Hint: If elastic &hellip; S.H.M &hellip; )
    \item When a gas in a cylinder is suddenly compressed by the pushing in of a piston, its temperature rises.
        Guess at an explanation of this in terms of the kinetic theory of gases, with the help of (a) above.
    \item Suppose a compressed gas, as in (c), is allowed to push a piston out, and expand.
        What would you expect to observe?
\end{enumerate}

## Molecular Size and Travel

A closed box contains a large number of gas molecules at fixed temperature.
Suppose the molecules magically became more bulky by swelling up to greater volume, without any increase in number or speed, without any change of mass, and without any change in the volume of the box.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item How would this affect the overoge distance apart of the molecules, center to center (great increase, decrease, or little change)?
    \item Give a reason for your onswer to (a).
    \item How would this affect the average distance travelled by a molecule between one collision and the next (the &ldquo;mean free path&rdquo;)?
    \item Give a reason for your answer to (c).
\end{enumerate}
