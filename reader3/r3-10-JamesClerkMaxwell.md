<span class="textsc">James Clerk Maxwell</span> was the greatest theoretical physicist of the nineteenth century.
His discoveries opened a new epoch of science, and much of what distinguishes our world from his is due to his work.
Because his ideas found perfect expression in mathematical symbolism, and also because his most spectacular triumph&emdash;the prophecy of the existence of electromagnetic waves&emdash;was the fruit of theoretical rather than experimental researches, he is often cited as the supreme example of a scientist who builds his systems entirely with pencil and paper.
This notion is false.
He was not, it is true, primarily an experimentalist.
He had not the magical touch of Faraday, of whom Helmholtz once observed after a visit to his laboratory that &ldquo;a few wires and some old bits of wood and iron seem to serve him for the greatest discoveries.&rdquo;
Nonetheless he combined a profound physical intuition with a formidable mathematical capacity to produce results &ldquo;partaking of both natures.&rdquo;
On the one hand, Maxwell never lost sight of the phenomena to be explained, nor permitted himself, as he said, to be drawn aside from the subject in pursuit of &ldquo;analytical subtleties&rdquo;;
    on the other hand, the use of mathematical methods conferred freedom on his inquiries and enabled him to gain physical insights without committing himself to a physical theory.
This blending of the concrete and the abstract was the characteristic of almost all his researches.


Maxwell was born at Edinburgh on November 13, 1831, the same year Faraday announced his famous discovery of electromagnetic induction.
He was descended of the Clerks of Penicuick in Midlothian, an old Scots family distinguished no less for their individuality, &ldquo;verging on eccentricity,&rdquo; than for their talents.
His forbears included eminent lawyers, judges, politicians, mining speculators, merchants, poets, musicians, and also the author (John Clerk) of a thick book on naval tactics, whose naval experience appears to have been confined entirely to sailing mimic men of war on the fishponds at Penicuick.
The name Maxwell was assumed by James&#39;s father, John Clerk, on inheriting the small estate of Middlebie from his grandfather Sir George Clerk Maxwell.


At Glenlair, a two-day carriage ride from Edinburgh and &ldquo;very much in the wilds,&rdquo; in a house built by his father shortly after he married.
Maxwell passed his infancy and early boyhood.
It was a happy time. He was an only son (a sister, born earlier, died in infancy) in a close-knit, comfortably-off family.
John Clerk Maxwell had been called to the Scottish bar but took little interest in the grubby pursuits of an advocate.
Instead the laird managed his small estates, took part in county affairs and gave loving attention to the education of his son.
He was a warm and rather simple man with a nice sense of humor and a penchant for doing things with what he called &ldquo;judiciosity&rdquo;; his main characteristic, according to Maxwell&#39;s biographer Lewis Campbell,

    The standard biography (London, 1882) is by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett.

was a &ldquo;persistent practical interest in all useful purposes.&rdquo;
Maxwell&#39;s mother, Frances Cay, who came of a well-known Northumbrian family, is described as having a &ldquo;sanguine, active temperament.&rdquo;

Jamesie, as he was called, was a nearsighted, lively, affectionate little boy, as persistently inquisitive as his father and as fascinated by mechanical contrivances.
To discover of anything &ldquo;how it doos&rdquo; was his constant aim.
&ldquo;What&#39;s the go of that?&rdquo;
he would ask, and if the answer did not satisfy him he would add, &ldquo;But what&#39;s the particular go of that?&rdquo;
His first creation was a set of figures for a &ldquo;wheel of life,&rdquo; a scientific toy that produced the illusion of continuous movement; he was fond of making things with his hands, and in later life knew how to design models embodying the most complex motions and other physical processes.


When Maxwell was nine, his mother died of cancer, the same disease that was to kill him forty years later.
Her death drew father and son even more closely together, and many intimate glimpses of Maxwell in his younger years emerge from the candid and affectionate letters he wrote to his father from the time he entered school until he graduated from Cambridge.


Maxwell was admitted to Edinburgh Academy as a day student when he was ten years old.
His early school experiences were painful.
The master, a dryish Scotsman whose reputation derived from a book titled Account of the Irregular Greek Verbs and from the fact that he was a good disciplinarian, expected his students to be orderly, well-grounded in the usual subjects and unoriginal.
Maxwell was deficient in all these departments. He created something of a sensation because of his clothes, which had been designed by his strongminded father and included such items as &ldquo;hygienic&rdquo; squaretoed shoes and a lace-frilled tunic.
The boys nicknamed him &ldquo;Dafty&rdquo; and mussed him up, but he was a stubborn child and in time won the respect of his classmates even if he continued to puzzle them.
There was a gradual awakening of mathematical interests.
He wrote his father that he had made a &ldquo;tetra hedron, a dodeca hedron, and two more hedrons that I don&#39;t know the wright names for,&rdquo; that he enjoyed playing with the &ldquo;boies,&rdquo; that he attended a performance of some &ldquo;Virginian minstrels,&rdquo; that he was composing Latin verse and making a list of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
Also, he sent him the riddle of the simpleton who &ldquo;wishing to swim was nearly drowned.
As soon as he got out he swore that he would never touch water till he had learned to swim.&rdquo;
In his fourteenth year he won the Academy&#39;s mathematical medal and wrote a paper on a mechanical method, using pins and thread, of constructing perfect oval curves. Another prodigious little boy, Rene Descartes, had anticipated Maxwell in this field, but Maxwell&#39;s contributions were completely independent and original.
It was a wonderful day for father and son when they heard &ldquo;Jas&#39;s&rdquo; paper on ovals read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh by Professor James Forbes: &ldquo;Met,&rdquo; Mr. Maxwell wrote of the event in his diary, &ldquo;with very great attention and approbation generally.&rdquo;

After six years at the Academy, Maxwell entered the University of Edinburgh.
He was sixteen, a restless, enigmatic, brilliantly talented adolescent who wrote not very good but strangely prophetic verse about the destiny of matter and energy:

<blockquote>
When earth and sun are frozen clods.

When all its energy degraded

Matter to aether shall have faded
</blockquote>


His friend and biographer Campbell records that James was completely neat in his person &ldquo;though with a rooted oi)jection to the vanities of starch and gloves,&rdquo; and that he had a &ldquo;pious horror of destroying anything&emdash;even a scrap of writing paper.&rdquo; He had a quaint humor, read voraciously and passed much time in mathematical speculations and in chemical, magnetic and optical experiments.
&ldquo;When at table he often seemed abstracted from what was going on, being absorbed in observing the effects of refracted light in the finger glasses, or in trying some experiment with his eyes&emdash;seeing around a corner, making invisible stereoscopes, and the like.
Miss Cay [his aunt] used to call his attention by crying, &#39;Jamesie, you&#39;re in a prop!&#39;
[an abbreviation for mathematical proposition].&rdquo;
He was by now a regular visitor at the meetings of the Edinburgh Royal Society, and two of his papers, on &ldquo;Rolling Curves&rdquo; and on the &ldquo;Equilibrium of Elastic Solids,&rdquo; were published in the Transactions.
The papers were read before the Society by others &ldquo;for it was not thought proper for a boy in a round jacket to mount the rostrum there.&rdquo;
During vacations at Glen- lair he was tremendously active and enjoyed reporting his multifarious doings in long letters to friends.
A typical communication, when Maxwell was seventeen, tells Campbell of building an &ldquo;electro-magnetic machine,&rdquo; taking off an hour to read Poisson&#39;s papers on electricity and magnetism (&ldquo;as I am pleased with him today&rdquo;), swimming and engaging in &ldquo;aquatic experiments,&rdquo; making a centrifugal pump, reading Herodotus, designing regular geometric figures, working on an electric telegraph, recording thermometer and barometer readings, embedding a beetle in wax to see if it was a good conductor of electricity (&ldquo;not at all cruel, because I slew him in boiling water in which he never kicked&rdquo;), taking the dogs out, picking fruit, doing &ldquo;violent exercise&rdquo; and solving props.
Many of his letters exhibit his metaphysical leanings, especially an intense interest in moral philosophy. This bent of his thought, while showing no particular originality, reflects his social sympathy, his Christian earnestness, the not uncommon nineteenth-century mixture of rationalism and simple faith.
It was a period when men still shared the eighteenth-century belief that questions of wisdom, happiness and virtue could be studied as one studies optics and mechanics.


In 1850 Maxwell quit the University of Edinburgh for Cambridge.
After a term at Peterhouse College he migrated to Trinity where the opportunity seemed better of obtaining ultimately a mathematical fellowship.
In his second year he became a private pupil of William Hopkins, considered the ablest mathematics coach of his time.
It was Hopkins&#39;s job to prepare his pupils for the stiff competitive examinations, the mathematical tripos, in which the attainment of high place insured academic preferment.
Hopkins was not easily impressed; the brightest students begged to join his group, and the famous physicists George Stokes and William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) had been among his pupils.
But from the beginning he recognized the talents of the black-haired young Scotsman, describing him as &ldquo;the most extraordinary man I have ever met,&rdquo; and adding that &ldquo;it appears impossible for [him] to think incorrectly on physical subjects.&rdquo;
Maxwell worked hard as an undergraduate, attending the lectures of Stokes and others and faithfully doing what he called &ldquo;old Hop&#39;s props.&rdquo;
He joined fully in social and intellectual activities and was made one of the Apostles, a club limited to twelve members, which for many years included the outstanding young men at Cambridge.
A contemporary describes him as &ldquo;the most genial and amusing of companions, the propounder of many a strange theory, the composer of many a poetic jeu d&#39;esprit.&rdquo;
Not the least strange of his theories related to finding an effective economy of work and sleep.
He would sleep from <span class="math">5</span> in the afternoon to 9:30, read very hard from 10 to 2, exercise by running along the corridors and up and down stairs from 2 to 2:30 a.m. and sleep again from 2:30 to 7.
The occupants of the rooms along his track were not pleased, but Maxwell persisted in his bizarre experiments.
Less disturbing were his investigations of the process by which a cat lands always on her feet.
He demonstrated that a cat could right herself even when dropped upside down on a table or bed from about two inches.
A complete record of these valuable researches is unfortunately not available.


A severe illness, referred to as a &rdquo;sort of brain fever,&rdquo; seized Maxwell in the summer of 1853.
For weeks he was totally disabled and he felt effects of his illness long afterward.
Despite the abundance of details about his life, it is hard to get to the man underneath.
From his letters one gleans evidence of deep inner struggles and anxieties, and the attack of &ldquo;brain fever&rdquo; was undoubtedly an emotional crisis; but its causes remain obscure.
All that is known is that his illness strengthened Maxwell&#39;s religious conviction&emdash;a deep, earnest piety, leaning to Scottish Calvinism yet never completely identified with any particular system or sect.
&ldquo;I have no nose for heresy,&rdquo; he used to say.


In January, 1854, with a rug wrapped round his feet and legs (as his father had advised) to mitigate the perishing cold in the Cambridge Senate House where the elders met and examinations were given, he took the tripos.
His head was warm enough. He finished second wrangler, behind the noted mathematician, Edward Routh.
(In another competitive ordeal, for the &ldquo;Smith&#39;s Prize,&rdquo; where the subjects were more advanced.
Maxwell and Routh tied for first.)


After getting his degree.
Maxwell stayed on for a while at Trinity, taking private pupils, reading Berkeley&#39;s Theory of Vision, which he greatly admired, and Mill&#39;s Logic, which he admired less: (&ldquo;I take him slowly &hellip; I do not think him the last of his kind&rdquo;), and doing experiments on the effects produced by mixing colors.
His apparatus consisted of a top, which he had designed himself, and colored paper discs that could be slipped one over the other and arranged round the top&#39;s axis so that any given portion of each color could be exposed.
When the top was spun rapidly, the sectors of the different colors became indistinguishable and the whole appeared of one uniform tint.
He was able to show that suitable combinations of three primary colors&emdash;red, green and blue&emdash;produced &ldquo;to a very near degree of approximation&rdquo; almost every color of the spectrum.
In each case the required combination could be quantitatively determined by measuring the sizes of the exposed sectors of the primary-color discs.
Thus, for example, 66.6 parts of red and 33.4 parts of green gave the same chromatic effect as 29.1 parts of yellow and 24.1 parts of blue. In general, color composition could be expressed by an equation of the form

\begin{equation}
xX = aA + bB + cC
\end{equation}

&emdash;shorthand for the statement that <span class="math">x</span> parts of <span class="math">X</span> can be matched by a parts of <span class="math">A</span>, <span class="math">b</span> parts of <span class="math">B</span> and <span class="math">c</span> parts of <span class="math">C</span>.
This symbolism worked out very prettily, for &ldquo;if the sign of one of the quantities, <span class="math">a</span>, <span class="math">6</span>, or <span class="math">c</span> was negative, it simply meant that that color had to be combined with X to match the other two.&rdquo;

}
The problem of color perception drew Maxwell&#39;s attention on and off for several years, and enlarged his scientific reputation.
The work was one phase of his passionate interest in optics, a subject to which he made many contributions ranging from papers on geometrical optics to the invention of an ophthalmoscope and studies in the &ldquo;Art of Squinting,&rdquo; Hermann von Helmholtz was of course the great leader in the field of color sensation, but Maxwell&#39;s work was independent and of high merit and in 1860 won him the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society.


These investigations, however, for all their importance, cannot be counted the most significant activity of the two postgraduate years at Trinity.
For during this same period he was reading with intense absorption Faraday&#39;s Experimental Researches, and the effect of this great record on his mind is scarcely to be overestimated.
He had, as he wrote his father, been &ldquo;working away at Electricity again, and [I] have been working my way into the views of heavy German writers.
It takes a long time to reduce to order all the notions one gets from these men, but I hope to see my way through the subject, and arrive at something intelligible in the way of a theory.&rdquo;
Faraday&#39;s wonderful mechanical analogies suited Maxwell perfectly; they were what he needed to stimulate his own conjectures.
Like Faraday, he thought more easily in images than abstractions: the models came first, the mathematics later.
A Cambridge contemporary said that in their student days, whenever the subject admitted of it, Maxwell &ldquo;had recourse to diagrams, though the rest [of the class] might solve the question more easily by a train of analysis.&rdquo;
It was his aim, he wrote, to take Faraday&#39;s ideas and to show how &ldquo;the connexion of the very different orders of phenomena which he had discovered may be clearly placed before the mathematical mind.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    The following quotation from the preface to Maxwell&#39;s Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (Cambridge, 1873) gives Maxwell&#39;s views of Faraday in his own words:
        &ldquo;Before I began the study of electricity I resolved to read no mathematics on the subject till I had first read through Faraday&#39;s Experimental Researches in Electricity.
    I was aware that there was supposed to be a difference between Faraday&#39;s way of conceiving phenomena and that of the mathematicians so that neither he nor they were satisfied with each other&#39;s language.
    I had also the conviction that this discrepancy did not arise from either party being wrong.
    &hellip; As I proceeded with the study of Faraday,
        I perceived that his method of conceiving the phenomena was also a mathematical one,
        though not exhibited in the conventional form of mathematical symbols.
    I also found that these methods were capable of being expressed in the ordinary mathematical forms,
        and these compared with those of the professed mathematicians.&rdquo;
}
Before the year 1855 was out,
Maxwell had published his first major contribution to electrical science, the beautiful paper &ldquo;On Faraday&#39;s Lines of Force,&rdquo; to which I shall return when considering his over-all achievements in the field.

Trinity elected Maxwell to a fellowship in 1855, and he began to lecture in hydrostatics and optics.
But his father&#39;s health, unsettled for some time, now deteriorated further, and it was partly to avoid their being separated that he became a candidate for the chair of natural philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen.
In 1856 his appointment was announced; his father, however, had died a few days before, an irreparable personal loss to Maxwell.
They had been as close as father and son could be.
They confided in each other, understood each other and were in certain admirable traits much alike.


The four years at Aberdeen were years of preparation as well as achievement.
Management of his estate, the design of a new &ldquo;compendious&rdquo; color machine, and the reading of metaphysics drew on his time.
The teaching load was rather light, a circumstance not unduly distressing to Maxwell.
He took his duties seriously, prepared lectures and demonstration experiments very carefully, but it cannot be said he was a great teacher.
At Cambridge, where he had picked students, his lectures were well attended, but with classes that were, in his own words, &ldquo;not bright,&rdquo; he found it difficult to hit a suitable pace.
He was unable himself to heed the advice he once gave a friend whose duty it was to preach to a country congregation:



&ldquo;Why don&#39;t you give it to them thinner?&rdquo;
\footnote{
    Occasionally he enjoyed mystifying his students, but at Aberdeen, where, he wrote Campbell. &ldquo;No jokes of any kind are understood,&rdquo; he did not permit himself such innocent enjoyments.
}
Electrical studies occupied him both during term and in vacation at Glenlair.
&ldquo;I have proved,&rdquo; he wrote in a semijocular vein to his friend C. J. Monro, &ldquo;that if there be nine coefficients of magnetic induction, perpetual motion will set in, and a small crystalline sphere will inevitably destroy the universe by increasing all velocities till the friction brings all nature into a state of incandescence &hellip; ,&rdquo;


Then suddenly the work on electricity was interrupted by a task that engrossed him for almost two years.
In competition for the Adams prize of the University of Cambridge (named in honor of the discoverer of Neptune), Maxwell prepared a brilliant essay on the subject set by the electors: &ldquo;The Structure of Saturn&#39;s Rings.&rdquo;


Beginning with Galileo, the leading astronomers had observed and attempted to explain the nature of the several concentric dark and bright rings encircling the planet Saturn.
The great Huygens had studied the problem, as had the Frenchman, Jean Dominique Cassini, Sir William Herschel and his son John, Laplace, and the Harvard mathematician and astronomer Benjamin Peirce.
The main question at the time Maxwell entered the competition concerned the stability of the ring system: Were the rings solid? Were they fluid?
Did they consist of masses of matter &ldquo;not mutually coherent&rdquo;?
The problem was to demonstrate which type of structure adequately explained the motion and permanence of the rings.


Maxwell&#39;s sixty-eight-page essay was a mixture of common sense, subtle mathematical reasoning and profound insight into the principles of mechanics.
\footnote{
    A summary of the work was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. IV; this summary and the essay &ldquo;On the Stability of the Motion of Saturn&#39;s Rings&rdquo; appear in the Scientific Papers (op. cit.) .
}
There was no point, he said at the outset, in imagining that the motion of the rings was the result of forces unfamiliar to us. We must assume that gravitation is the regulating principle and reason accordingly.
The hypothesis that the rings are solid and uniform he quickly demonstrated to be untenable; indeed Laplace had already shown that an arrangement of this kind would be so precarious that even a slight displacement of the center of the ring from the center of the planet &ldquo;would originate a motion which would never be checked, and would inevitably precipitate the ring upon the planet &hellip; &rdquo;


Suppose the rings were not uniform, but loaded or thickened on the circumference&emdash;a hypothesis for which there ap- peared to be observational evidence.
A mechanically stable system along these lines was theoretically possible; yet here too, as Maxwell proved mathematically, the delicate adjustment and distribution of mass required could not survive the most minor perturbations.
What of the fluid hypothesis?
To be sure, in this circumstance the rings would not collide with the planet.
On the other hand, by the principles of fluid motion it can be proved that waves would be set up in the moving rings.
Using methods devised by the French mathematician Joseph Fourier for studying heat conduction, by means of which complex wave motions can be resolved into their simple harmonic, sine-cosine elements.
Maxwell succeeded in demonstrating that the waves of one ring will force waves in another and that, in due time, since the wave amplitudes will increase indefinitely, the rings will break up into drops.
Thus the continuous-fluid ring is no better a solution of the problem than the solid one.


The third possibility remained, that the rings consist of disconnected particles, either solid or liquid, but necessarily independent.
Drawing on the mathematical theory of rings.
Maxwell proved that such an arrangement is fairly stable and its disintegration very slow; that the particles may be disposed in a series of narrow rings or may move through each other irregularly.
He called this solution his &ldquo;dusky ring, which is something like the state of the air supposing the siege of Sebastopol conducted from a forest of guns 100 miles one way, and 30,000 miles from the other, and the shot never to stop, but go spinning away around a circle, radius 170,000 miles&hellip; &rdquo;

Besides the mathematical demonstration.
Maxwell devised an elegantly ingenious model to exhibit the motions of the satellites in a disturbed ring, &ldquo;for the edification of sensible composed of particles.
(Scientific Amencan) image-worshippers.&rdquo;
His essay&emdash;which Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, described as one of the most remarkable applications of mathematics he had ever seen&emdash;won the prize and established him as a leader among mathematical physicists.


In 1859 Maxwell read before the British Association his paper &ldquo;Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory of Gases.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    Philosophical Magazine, January and July. 1860; also Maxwell&#39;s Scientific Papers, op. cit.
}
This marked his entry into a branch of physics that he enriched almost as much as he did the science of electricity.
Two circumstances excited his interest in the kinetic theory of gases.
The first was the research on Saturn, when he encountered the mathematical problem of handling the irregular motions of the particles in the rings&emdash;irregular but resulting nonetheless in apparent regularity and uniformity&emdash;a problem analogous to that of the behavior of the particles of gas.
The second was the publication by the German physicist Rudolf Clausius of two famous memoirs: on the heat produced by molecular motion and on the average length of the path a gas molecule travels before colliding with a neighbor.


Maxwell&#39;s predecessors in this field&emdash;Daniel Bernoulli, James Joule, Clausius, among others&emdash;had been successful in explaining many of the properties of gases, such as pressure, temperature, and density, on the hypothesis that a gas is composed of swiftly moving particles.
However, in order to simplify the mathematical analysis of the behavior of enormous aggregates of particles, it was thought necessary to make an altogether implausible auxiliary assumption, namely, that all the particles of a gas moved at the same speed.
The gifted British physicist J. J. Waterson alone rejected this assumption, in a manuscript communicated to the Royal Society in 1845: he argued cogently that various collisions among the molecules must produce different velocities and that the gas temperature is proportional to the square of the velocities of all the molecules.
But his manuscript lay forgotten for half a century in the archives of the Society.


Maxwell, without knowledge of Waterson&#39;s work, arrived at the same conclusions.
He realized that further progress in the science of gases was not to be cheaply won.
If the subject was to be developed on &ldquo;strict mechanical principles&rdquo;&emdash;and for him this rigorous procedure was essential&emdash;it was necessary, he said, not only to concede what was in any case obvious, that the particles as a result of collisions have different speeds, but to incorporate this fact into the mathematical formulation of the laws of motion of the particles.


Now, to describe how two spheres behave on colliding is hard enough; Maxwell analyzed this event, but only as a prelude to the examination of an enormously more complex phenomenon&emdash;the behavior of an &ldquo;indefinite number of small, hard and perfectly elastic spheres acting on one another only during impact.&rdquo;
\footnote{
    &ldquo;Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory of Gases, op. cit.
}
The reason for this mathematical investigation was clear.
For as he pointed out, if the properties of this assemblage are found to correspond to those of molecular assemblages of gases, &ldquo;an important physical analogy will be established, which may lead to more accurate knowledge of the properties of matter.&rdquo;


The mathematical methods were to hand but had hitherto not been applied to the problem.
Since the many molecules cannot be treated individually, Maxwell introduced the statistical method for dealing with the assemblage.
This marked a great forward step in the study of gases.
A fundamental Maxwellian innovation was to regard the molecules as falling into groups, each group moving within a certain range of velocity.
The groups lose members and gain them, but group population is apt to remain pretty steady.
Of course the groups differ in size; the largest, as Maxwell concluded, possesses the most probable velocity, the smaller groups the less probable.
In other words, the velocities of the molecules in a gas can be conceived as distributed in a pattern&emdash;the famous bell-shaped frequency curve discovered by Gauss, which applies to so many phenomena from observational errors and distribution of shots on a target to groupings of men based on height and weight, and the longevity of electric light bulbs.
Thus while the velocity of an individual molecule might elude description, the velocity of a crowd of molecules would not.
Because this method afforded knowledge not only of the velocity of a body of gas as a whole, but also of the groups of differing velocities composing it.
Maxwell was now able to derive a precise formula for gas pressure.
Curiously enough this expression did not differ from that based on the assumption that the velocity of all the molecules is the same, but at last the right conclusions had been won by correct reasoning.
Moreover the generality and elegance of Maxwell&#39;s mathematical methods led to the extension of their use into almost every branch of physics.


Maxwell went on, in this same paper, to consider another factor that needed to be determined, namely, the average number of collisions of each molecule per unit of time, and its mean free path (i.e., how far it travels, on the average, between collisions).
These data were essential to accurate formulations of the laws of gases.
He reasoned that the most direct method of computing the path depended upon the viscosity of the gas.
This is the internal friction that occurs when (in Maxwell&#39;s words) &ldquo;different strata of gas slide upon one another with different velocities and thus act upon one another with a tangential force tending to prevent this sliding, and similar in its results to the friction between two solid surfaces sliding over each other in the same way.&rdquo;
According to Maxwell&#39;s hypothesis, the viscosity can be explained as a statistical consequence of innumerable collisions between the molecules and the resulting exchange of momentum.
A very pretty illustration by the Scotch physicist Balfour Stewart helps to an understanding of what is involved.
Imagine two trains running with uniform speed in opposite directions on parallel tracks close together.
Suppose the passengers start to jump across from one train to the other.
Each passenger carries with him a momentum opposite to that of the train onto which he jumps; the result is that the velocity of both trains is slowed just as if there were friction between them.
A similar process, said Maxwell, accounts for the apparent viscosity of gases.


Having explained this phenomenon, Maxwell was now able to show its relationship to the mean free path of the molecules.
Imagine two layers of molecules sliding past each other.
If a molecule passing from one layer to the other travels only a short distance before colliding with another molecule, the two particles do not exchange much momentum, because near the boundary or interface the friction and difference of velocity between the two layers is small.
But if the molecule penetrates deep into the other layer before a collision, the friction and velocity differential will be greater; hence the exchange of momentum between the colliding particles will be greater.
This amounts to saying that in any gas with high viscosity the molecules must have a long mean free path.


Maxwell deduced further the paradoxical and fundamental fact that the viscosity of gas is independent of its density.
The reason is that a particle entering a dense&emdash;i.e., highly crowded&emdash;gas will not travel far before colliding with another particle; but penetration on the average will be deeper when the gas entered is only thinly populated, because the chance of a collision is smaller.
On the other hand, there will be more collisions in a dense than in a less dense gas.
On balance, then, the momentum conveyed across each unit area per second remains the same regardless of density, and so the coefficient of viscosity is not altered by varying the density.


These results, coupled with others arrived at in the same paper, made it possible for Maxwell to picture a mechanical model of phenomena and relationships hitherto imperfectly understood.
The various properties of a gas&emdash;diffusion, viscosity, heat conduction&emdash;could now be explained in precise quantitative terms.
All are shown to be connected with the motion of crowds of particles &ldquo;carrying with them their momenta and their energy,&rdquo; traveling certain distances, colliding, changing their motion, resuming their travels, and so on.
Altogether it was a scientific achievement of the first rank.
The reasoning has since been criticized on the ground, for example, that molecules do not possess the tiny-billiard-ball properties Maxwell ascribed to them; that they are neither hard, nor perfectly elastic; that their interaction is not confined to the actual moment of impact.
Yet despite the inadequacies of the model and the errors of reasoning, the results that, as Sir James Jeans has said, &ldquo;ought to have been hopelessly wrong,&rdquo; turned out to be exactly right, and the formula tying the relationships together is in use to this day, known as Maxwell&#39;s law.

    &ldquo;Maxwell, by a train of argument which seems to bear no relation at all to molecules, or to the dynamics of their movements, or to logic, or even to ordinary common sense, reached a formula which, according to all precedents and all the rules of scientific philosophy ought to have been hopelessly wrong.
    In actual fact it was subsequently shown to be exactly right &hellip; &rdquo; (James Jeans.  &ldquo;Clerk Maxwell&#39;s Method,&rdquo; in James Clerk Maxwell, A Commemoration Volume, 1831&endash;1931, New York, 1931.)

This is perhaps a suitable place to add a few lines about Maxwell&#39;s later work in the theory of gases.
Clausius, Max Planck tells us, was not profoundly impressed by the law of distribution of velocities, but the German physicist Ludwig Boltzmann at once recognized its significance.
He set to work refining and generalizing Maxwell&#39;s proof and succeeded, among other results, in showing that &ldquo;not only does the Maxwell distribution [of velocities] remain stationary, once it is attained, but that it is the only possible equilibrium state, since any system will eventually attain it, whatever its initial state.&rdquo;

This final equilibrium state, as both men realized, is the thermodynamic condition of maximum entropy&emdash;the most disordered state, in which the least amount of energy is available for useful work.
But since this condition is in the long run also the most probable, purely from the mathematical standpoint, one of the great links had been forged in modern science between the statistical law of averages and the kinetic theory of matter.


The concept of entropy led Maxwell to one of the celebrated images of modern science, namely, that of the sorting demon.
Statistical laws, such as the kinetic theory of gases, are good enough in their way, and, at any rate, are the best man can arrive at, considering his limited powers of observations and understanding.
Increasing entropy, in other words, is the explanation we are driven to&emdash;and indeed our fate in physical reality&emdash;because we are not very bright.
But a demon more favorably endowed could sort out the slow&endash; and fast-moving particles of a gas, thereby changing disorder into order and converting unavailable into available energy.
Maxwell imagined one of these small, sharp fellows &ldquo;in charge of a frictionless, sliding door in a wall separating two compartments of a vessel filled with gas.
When a fast-moving molecule moves from left to right the demon opens the door, when a slow moving molecule approaches, he (or she) closes the door.
The fast-moving molecules accumulate in the right-hand compartment, and slow ones in the left.
The gas in the first compartment grows hot and that in the second cold.&rdquo;
Thus the demon would thwart the second law of thermodynamics.
Living organisms, it has been suggested, achieve an analogous success; as Erwin Schrodinger has phrased it, they suck negative entropy from the environment in the food they eat and the air they breathe.


Maxwell and Boltzmann, working independently and in a friendly rivalry, at first made notable progress in explaining the behavior of gases by statistical mechanics.
After a time, however, formidable difficulties arose, which neither investigator was able to overcome.
For example, they were unable to write accurate theoretical formulas for the specific heats of certain gases (the quantity of heat required to impart a unit increase in temperature to a unit mass of the gas at constant pressure and volume).
\footnote{
    In order to resolve discrepancies between theory and experiment, as to the viscosity of gases and its relationship to absolute temperature.
    Maxwell suggested a new model of gas behavior, in which the molecules are no longer considered as elastic spheres of definite radius but as more or less undefined bodies repelling one another inversely as the fifth power of the distance between the centers of gravity.
    By this trick he hoped to explain observed properties of gases and to bypass mathematical obstacles connected with computing the velocity of a gas not in a steady state.
    For, whereas in the case of hard elastic bodies molecular collisions are a discontinuous process (each molecule retaining its velocity until the moment of impact) and the computation of the distribution of velocities is essential in solving ([uestions of viscosity, if the molecular interaction is by repulsive force, acting very weakly when the molecules are far away from each other and strongly when they approach closely, each- collision may be conceived as a rapid but continuous transition from the initial to the final velocity, and the computation both of relative velocities of the colliding molecules
    and of the velocity distribution of the gas a&endash; a whole can be dispensed with.
    In his famous memoir <em>On the Dynamical Theory of Gases</em>, which appeared in 1866, Maxwell gave a beautiful mathematical account of the properties of such a system.
    The memoir inspired Boltzmann to a Wagnerian rapture.
    He compared Maxwell&#39;s theory to a musical drama: &ldquo;At first are developed majestically the Variations of the Velocities, then from one side enter the Equations of State, from the other the Equations of Motion in a Central Field; ever hifiher swoops the chaos of Formulae; suddenly are heard the four words: `Put $n = 5$&#39;.
    The evil spirit <span class="math">V</span> (the relative velocity of two molecules) vanishes and the dominating figure in the bass is suddenly silent; that which had seemed insuperable being overcome as if by a magic stroke &hellip; result after result is given by the pliant formula till, as unexpected climax, comes the Heat Equilibrium of a heavy gas; the curtain then drops.&rdquo;

    Unfortunately, however, the descent of the curtain did not, as Boltzmann had supposed, mark a happy ending. For as James Jeans points out, &ldquo;Maxwell&#39;s belief that the viscosity of an actual gas varied directly as the absolute temperature proved to have been based on faulty arithmetic, and the conclusions he drew from his belief were vitiated by faulty algebra.&rdquo; [Jeans, op. cit.] It was, says Jeans, &ldquo;a very human failing, which many of us will welccmie as a bond of union between ourselves and a really great mathematician&rdquo;&emdash;even though the results were disastrous.
}
The existing mathematical techniques simply did not reach&emdash;and a profound transformation of ideas had to take place before physics could rise to&emdash;a new level of understanding.
Quantum theory&emdash;the far-reaching system of thought revolving about Planck&#39;s universal constant, h&emdash;was needed to deal with the phenomena broached by Maxwell and Boltzmann.
\footnote{
    Explanation of the discrepancies they found had to await the development of quantum theory, which showed that the spin and vibration of molecules were restricted to certain values.
}
The behavior of microscopic particles eluded description by classical methods, classical concepts of mass, energy and the like; a finer mesh of imagination alone would serve in the small world of the atom.
But neither quantum theory, nor relativity, nor the other modes of thought constituting the twentieth-century revolution in physics would have been possible had it not been for the brilliant labors of these natural philosophers in applying statistical methods to the study of gases.
