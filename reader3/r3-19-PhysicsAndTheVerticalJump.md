\begin{abstract}
The physics of vertical jumping is described as an interesting and &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; illustration for motivating students in a general physics course to master the kinematics and dynamics of one dimensional motion.
The equation for the height of the jump is derived (1) from the kinematic equations and Newton's laws of motion and (2) from the conservation of energy principle applied to the potential and kinetic energies at two positions of the jump.
The temporal behavior of the reaction force and the center of gravity position during a typical jump are discussed. 
Mastery of the physical principles of the jump may promote understanding of certain biological phenomena, aspects of physical education, and even of documents on ancient history.

## Introduction

When the New York Mets recently won the 1969 World Series in basebalV the New York Times carried a front page picture of one of the players jumping for joy into the arms of another.
Jumping for joy might occur even in a physics class if a student should suddenly realize that he understands something new.
The something new can be on quite an old subject.
This paper will present some aspects of the ancient subject of jumping, the broad jump, and the high jump.\cite{ }

The physics of the vertical jump, in particular, is sufficiently simple in its basic elements that it can be mastered by most students in an introductory physics course.
At the same time, it has the appealing feature for our hippie-like alienated college student of being relevant to so many modern experiences.
Neil Armstrong's ability to jump up high on the moon\cite{}, or Bob Beamon's record breaking broad jump in Mexico\cite{}, or just plain off-the-record jumping on a dance floor or basketball court are more exciting illustrations of the pull of gravity to the average student&emdash;and perhaps to some professors too&emdash;than are Galileo's bronze balls rolling down inclined planes.\cite{}
(No slight to Galileo is intended!)


Should these examples not produce enough class participation (or even if they do), the instructor can liven things up by on the spot jumping experiments.
For example, he can suspend from the ceiling some valuable coin (a &ldquo;copper sandwich&rdquo; quarter will do too) which is just an inch or two above the jumping reach of a six footer (about nine feet from the floor).
The instructor then might announce that the coin will be given to whoever can jump up and reach it.
To the surprise of most of the class, the six footer can't quite make it.
For the participation of the shorter members of the class, one can suspend other coins at lower levels and allow students in certain height ranges to jump for specific coins.\cite{}


The problem of class involvement in a recitation section of an introductory noncalculus physics course was the stimulus which lead the author to research the &ldquo;science&rdquo; of jumping; his findings may perhaps provide other teachers with a stimulant (legal and harmless) for their class discussions.\cite{}

A description of the physics of vertical jumping can be directed towards one or more of several goals such as (a) appUcation of one dimensional kinematic equations of motion, (b) illustration of Newton's third law on reaction forces\cite{}, (c) study of nonuniformly accelerated one dimensional motion, (d) motivation for learning the derivation or kinematical equations, and (e) application of physical principles in other disciplines such as zoology, physical education, and physiology.


For simpUcity, the presentation which follows will be restricted primarily to the standing vertical jump.
However, some features can easily be extended to other kinds of jumping such as the standing broad jump or the swimmer's dive.
The latter examples illustrate the appUcation of the kinematic equations in two dimensions.


## The Physics of Jumping: Class Presentation

One can initiate the class discussion on jumping by such questions as: How high can you jump?
Could you do better if you were in a high flying airplane, if your legs were longer, if you were in Philadelphia or in Mexico City, if you wore sneakers or jumped with barefeet?
How good is man as a jumper compared to a kangaroo or a grasshopper?
In what way does an individual's physical condition affect the maximum height of his jump?

</figure>


The order and nature of the presentation can be varied according to the instructor's imagination.
If the class is &ldquo;willing&rdquo; to be taught a derivation, then one can start by deriving

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2}
    d = v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
\end{equation}


It is useful to impress upon the students the fact that this kinematical equation for uniform acceleration can be derived purely from the definitions of average velocity and acceleration.\cite{}
Such a derivation can be easily mastered by virtually every student.


### Derivation of the Height Equation from the Kinematic Equations and Newton's Third Law

The definition of uniform acceleration can be written as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:2}
    v_f = v_0 + at
\end{equation}

where <span class="math">v_f</span> is the final velocity, <span class="math">v_0</span> is the original velocity, <span class="math">a</span> is the uniform acceleration, and <span class="math">t</span> is the interval over which the velocity change occurred.
Eliminating the time between Eqs. (1) and (2), one obtains the well-known relation between <span class="math">v_f</span>, <span class="math">v_0</span>, and the distance d over which uniform acceleration takes place:

\begin{equation}
    v_f^2 = v_0^2 + 2ad
    \label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

The total distance over which the displacement of the center of gravity takes place during the jump may be divided into two segments (see Fig. \ref{fig:1}), the stretching segment <span class="math">S</span> and the free flight path <span class="math">H</span>.
One can now apply Eq. (3) over the two different segments as follows.
For the stretching part (which extends from the beginning of the crouched position to the erect position before contact with the ground is lost [Figs. \ref{fig:1}(a) and \ref{fig:1}(b)]) the acceleration, <span class="math">a</span>, is given by the average net upward force on the jumper, <span class="math">F_n</span>, divided by the mass of the jumper, <span class="math">m</span>.
As $v_0 =0$, substitution in Eq. \ref{eq:3} gives

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:4a}
    v_{j0}^2 = \frac{2F_n}{m} S,
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
    F_n = F_r - mg,
\end{equation}

<span class="math">F_r</span> is the average reaction force of the ground on the jumper during the upward displacement <span class="math">S</span>.
We have labeled the final velocity at the end of segments as $v_{j0}$, the jumping off velocity.


For the free flight path, however, the final velocity at the highest position is zero, the acceleration is <span class="math">&minus;g</span>, and $v_0= v_{j0}$.
One then obtains <span class="math">H</span>, the displacement of the center of gravity from the erect position to the highest point, [Figs. \ref{fig:1}b and \ref{fig:1}c] from the equation

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:4b}
    0 = v_{j0}^2 - 2gH.
\end{equation}

Or, combining (\ref{eq:4a}) and (\ref{eq:4b}) one finally obtains

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:5}
    H = \frac{F_n S}{mg}.
\end{equation}

The limbs extend to their maximum extent in about $\frac{1}{30}$ sec.

### Derivation Based on Conservation of Energy

An alternative way of deriving this result using the conservation of energy principle is as follows: Take the crouched position as the zero reference potential.
The total amount of work done on the jumper by the floor during the push off period is equal to the potential energy change, <span class="math">mgS</span>, plus the kinetic energy imparted at position <span class="math">S</span> which is

\begin{equation}
    \int^S_0 F_n\, dS.
\end{equation}

At the top of the jump the kinetic energy is again zero and the potential energy is $mg\left(H+S\right)$.
Therefore, from the conservation of energy principle

\begin{equation}
    mg\left( H+S \right) = mgS + \int^S_0 F_n\,dS.
\end{equation}

When solved for H this gives an equation ecjuivalent to (5)
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:6}
    H = \int^S_0 F_n\,dS / mg
\end{equation}

Note that $F_n S$ in Eq. \ref{eq:5} is replaced by the integral

\begin{equation*}
    \int^S_0 F_n\,dS.
\end{equation*}

This makes Eq. \ref{eq:6} valid for nonuniform acceleration, whereas use of Eq. \ref{eq:3} in the previous derivation involves the assumption of uniform acceleration. 

In a typical jump a man weighing 140 lb producing an average reaction force during take off of about 300 lb and able to stretch over a distance <span class="math">S</span> of 1.4 ft will lift his center of gravity 1.6 ft:

\begin{equation*}
    H = \left(\frac{300-140}{140}\right) \times 1.4 = 1.6\,\text{ft}
\end{equation*}


With the help of Eq. \ref{eq:5} the student should now be able to answer many of the questions posed earlier such as the effect of gravity or of the length of one's legs. 
Consideration of Eq. \ref{eq:5} might also give the student some clue about the remarkable jumping ability of the grasshopper. 
A series of positions during a grasshopper's jump are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:2}.\cite{}
The pictures were taken at intervals of 1/120 sec.
Particularly noteworthy are (1) the rapid take off for his jump (about 1/30 sec compared to the human take off time of more than half a second) and (2) the long stretch, <span class="math">S</span>, permitted because of his long hind legs and their particular construction. 
(See Sec. IV for further details). 
Indeed, these pictures might instill the student high jump athlete (the one who may have succeeded in getting the valuable coin) with a bit of humility. 
Whereas for a superior athlete a jump up to $\frac{1}{3}$ his height is a creditable performance, an average grasshopper can jump well over ten times his own height and even a 5~ft kangaroo can jump up to 8~ft above the ground!

## Gerrish's Standing Vertical Jump

In Fig. \ref{fig:3}a is shown the time record of the center of gravity position and the ground's reaction force <span class="math">F_r</span> in a typical vertical jump of Paul H. Gerrish, the author of a 1934 Ph.D thesis on the subject of jumping.\cite{} 
It is interesting to note that during the first 0.42~sec of the jump the reaction force is less than the static weight,\cite{} and that the downward velocity reaches a maximum of 3.8 ft/sec. 
After 0.61~sec, the velocity is zero and the drop of the center of gravity is about 1.2~ft. 
The upward acceleration has a duration of 0.24~sec; during that period the reaction force varies from about twice his weight to about 2.4 times his weight.
The &ldquo;gravity controlled&rdquo; part of his jump (from lift off to the highest point) takes about 0.3~sec while the total time for the entire jump is less than 2~sec.

### Apparatus

Gerrish designed his own force meter.\cite{}
This was a device which minimized the vibration and inertia forces and which transmitted the force of the jump on a platform via hydrostatic pressure to an Ashton single spring Bourbon-type pressure gauge. 
He used a calibrated 16~mm movie camera with a speed of 53.1 frames per second for timing the sequence of positions. 
He obtained the appropriate height in each frame by aligning, with the aid of 22 (or 44) fold magnification, a reference mark close to the center of gravity of his body (over the anterior superior spine of the right ilium) with the divisions of a surveyor's measuring rod.


### Statistical Results for Other Jumpers

In Gerrish's analysis of 270 jumps of 45 Columbia University men he found that the tallest or heaviest jumpers did not always demonstrate greater maximum forces, velocities, powers, or height displacements for the jump than the shortest or Ughtest jumpers, respectively.\cite{}
He also noted that maximum height displacement varied within the rather narrow range of 1 and 2 ft and that the subjects demonstrated a range of <em>minimum</em> forces from 15\%&endash;74\% of their static weight, and a range of rnaximum forces from 210\%&endash;375\% of this weight.  

### Analysis of Jump

An interesting aspect of the jump is the energy and power requirement for jumping. 
From the raw data of Fig. \ref{fig:3}(a) one can compute the velocity curve and then construct a power curve by multiplying the latter with the appropriate ordinates of the force curve. 
These curves are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:3}(b). 
The reader may find it interesting to analyze these curves in detail. 
It should be noted that the force and height curves are consistent with each other, thus providing evidence for the validity of the measurements in Fig. \ref{fig:3}(a).
This consistency was checked in two ways. 
(1) The impulse imparted to the jumper at the end of the stretch $P_{j0}$ can be calculated from the integral

\begin{equation*}
    \int^{T_2}_{T_1} F_n\,dt .
\end{equation*}

This value agrees to within 0.4\% with the momentum obtained from the free flight deceleration to maximum height, $P_{j0} = mv_{j0} = mg\left(T_1 — T_2\right)$.
(2) The force curve can be integrated twice with respect to time and the resultant curve turns out to agree well with the height curve.

The achievement in the vertical jump is directly related to the power developed during the jump. 
This in turn depends on the steepness of the velocity curve and the ability to maintain close to the maximum torce durmg the 0.2 sec of the stretching segment\cite{} [see Fig. \ref{fig:3}(b)].

## Jumping and Other Disciplines

The student's motivation for learning a new subject is usually enhanced if he is made to realize its connection wth other studies he is undertaking simultaneously or in which he has some innate interest. 
To cite a few examples of how an understanding of the physics of jumping can be helpful in other fields of study, let us turn to an application in biology (the jump of the grasshopper) and to two applications in physical education (Olympic records and the Sargent jump).

### Biological Application

The outstanding animal jumpers include, in addition to the kangaroo and grasshopper, the frog and the flea. 
Although these animals perform much better than man when their jumps are measured in terms of their body length,\cite{} the ratio of their broad jump to high jump lengths is between 3 and 4 which is similar to man's performance. 
Actually, the fact that animals can jump, higher in terms of their own dimensions is not surprising as can be shown by the following simple scaling argument. 
If it is assumed that the strength of an animal to exert a force <span class="math">F</span> is proportional to the cross sectional area of his muscular tissue <span class="math">A</span> then <span class="math">F</span> is proportional to $L^2$, where <span class="math">L</span> specifies its linear dimension. 
However, the mass <span class="math">m</span> for constant density is proportional to $L^2$.
Therefore, the acceleration, being equal to $F/m$, is proportional to $L^{-1}$.
As the stretch distance <span class="math">S</span> is proportional to <span class="math">L</span>, one sees from Eq. (4a) that $v_{j0}$ is unaffected by a down scaling. 
Therefore, the relatively large jumping achievements of the smaller insects are not really too surprising because if $v_{j0}$ is unaffected, so is <span class="math">H</span> [see Eq. \ref{eq:4b}].

In a 1958 article in Scientific American, a grasshopper's physiology, responsible for its skill in jumping, is described. 
One of its secrets lies in the construction of its hind legs. 
These legs differ from those of most other insects in that the angle between the femur (thigh) and the tibia (shin) is not obtuse but acute. 
This permits a bigger value for <span class="math">S</span> and a longer period of possible acceleration as was mentioned before. 
Another feature is that its extensor muscle (which straightens the leg) is larger than its flexor muscle (which bends it). 
It can lift off from the ground a weight ten times its own and develops, during this feat, a tension equal to 250 times its own weight. 

### Jumping and Athletics

While jumping is a component of many sports (for example, basketball, diving, skiing), it has for many centuries captured men's imagination in its own right. 
Indeed, Beamon's record-breaking broad jump of <span class="math">29</span>~ft~$2\frac{1}{2}$~in. bettering the previous world record by almost two feet (<span class="math">1</span>~ft~<span class="math">9</span>~in.) was the sensation of the 1968 Mexico Olympics.\cite{}

### Olympic Records and the Acceleration of Gravity

In comparing record performances, one should, in all fairness, take account of variations in <span class="math">g</span> that exist between two localities. \cite{}
From Eq. \ref{eq:5} one can culculate the difference in height, <span class="math">&Delta;H</span>, which results from the difference in the <span class="math">g</span> values between two localities. 
Namely, the fractional change in <span class="math">H</span> is equal to the negative of the fractional change in $g: \Delta H/H = — \Delta g/g$.
As the maximum variation of <span class="math">g</span> on the surface of the earth is about $\frac{1}{2}$\%, in a seven foot jump <span class="math">&Delta;H</span> expressed in inches may be as much as 0.42 in. ($7\times 12\times 0.005$). 
As high jumps and broad jumps are customarily recorded to $\frac{1}{8}$-th of an inch or even $\frac{1}{16}$-th of an inch, a fair comparison may very well reverse the standings of the record holders.
An examination of the broad iump winners at the 1948 London Olympics (Latitude $51^{\circ}30^{\prime}$N) and the 1956 Melbourne Olympics (Latitude $37^{\circ}52^{\prime}$S) shows indeed that W. Steele's (U.S.) performance in London of <span class="math">25</span>~ft~$8\frac{1}{16}$~in. was better than G. Bell's (U.S.) jump of <span class="math">25</span>~ft~$8\frac{1}{4}$~in. in Melbourne when their jumps are compared at the same <span class="math">g</span>. 
The increase in <span class="math">g</span> of $1.09$ cm/sec$^2$ from Melbourne to London accounts for a decrease in jump length of $0.34$~in.,\cite{} whereas their actual recorded difference is only $0.19$~in.
This &ldquo;injustice&rdquo; in reality didn't matter too much because both records were below the <span class="math">26</span>~ft~$5\frac{5}{16}$~in. record established by Jesse Owens in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. 
This wasn't broken until the 1960 Olympics, which in turn was bettered phenomenally two years ago by Beamon.

### The Sargent Jump (or jumping as a test of athletic ability)

The standing vertical jump has been used for close to half a century by persons interested in tests and measurements in physical education. 
In searching for a physical ability test which would correlate with an individual's performance in track and field events, it was found that a particular type of vertical jump, known as the Sargent jump,\cite{} produced a high correlation with such events as the six second run, running high jump, standing broad jump, and the shot put. 
The instructions for the adminstration of the Sargent jump read as follows:

<blockquote>
    the jumper is to swing his arms downward and backward inclinging the body slightly forward and bending the knees to about $90^{\circ}$ and raising the heels. 
    He is to pause a &ldquo;moment&rdquo; in this position and then to jump vertically upward as high as possible, swinging his arms vigorously forward and upward to a vertical position. 
    Just before the highest point of the jump he is to swing his arms forward and downward to his side. 
    The end of the downward swing should be timed so as to coincide with the reaching of the highest point of the jump. 
    The legs should be stretched downward and the head should be stretched upward without tilting the chin.\cite{}
</blockquote>

Gerrish's jump was similar to the Sargent jump except for the arm movements. 
In his thesis, he makes the interesting observation that the location of the center of gravity did not vary by more than $\frac{1}{2}$~in. for various body positions (with legs bent, trunk inclined forward, etc.) assumed during his jump. 
Apparently, the purpose of the downward swing of the arms in the Sargent jump is to displace the center of gravity downward with respect to the body so as to increase the height reached by the top of the head. 

### Broad jumping

Broad jumping is closely related to the high jump except that the initial velocity is at an angle less than $90^{\circ}$ with the horizontal. 
Ideally, if the body were to be considered as a free projectile, for maximum range the take off velocity should be directed at $45^{\circ}$ with the horizontal (see equation in Ref. 19).
The actual take off directions of broad jumpers turn out to be around $30^{\circ}$.


The take off position in the standing high jump and the standing broad jump of a skilled college woman is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:4}.\cite{}
Note that the difference in inclination of body segments is mainly due to the difference in foot inclination. 
In the broad jump additional distance can be gained by shifting the center of gravity backwards through the motion of the arms, especially if the broad jumper grasps weights in each hand. 
Recent experiments have shown that the length of the jump could be increased by <span class="math">15</span>&endash;<span class="math">20</span> cm if the jumper holds 5~lb weights in each hand.\cite{}
These experiments were conducted in a historical-philological study to understand some &ldquo;legends&rdquo; of broad jumping feats of Phajdlos of Kroton and Chionis of Sparta.
This study arrives at the conclusion that if the pentathlon events of these two athletes consisted of five partial jumps (i.e., five standing broad jumps with a pause in between each jump), then the record distances of <span class="math">55</span> and <span class="math">52</span>~ft, respectively attributed to the above athletic heroes are believable; yet they represent superior performances worthy of legendary transmission. 

## Summary and Suggestions For Jumping Farther

It is suggested in this paper that jumping &ldquo;exercises&rdquo; could provide lively, student-involving, real physical situations to teach some of the beginning fundamentals of mechanics. 
Realistic discussion of the factors affecting the &ldquo;altitude&rdquo; of a jump can be conducted with the help of Fig. \ref{fig:3} which describes the temporal behavior of the reaction forces and center of gravity positions in a typical jump. 
Although this provides only sample curves for a specific type of jump, most likely the general features are similar in many other kinds of jumps such as the broad jump or the chalk and Sargent jumps. 
The phase lag of the force curve behind the position curve and the initial dip in the force curve are common features of all of these jumps.

The application of the laws of mechanics to biology and athletics will motivate some students to make the special effort required to understand such concepts as Newton's third law, the relationship of velocity to position in nonuniform acceleration, the physical concept of power and momentum, the effect of gravity and its variation with position, even the meaning of conservation of energy when biological systems are involved.
Furthermore, to the interested and capable student, it might provide the stimulus for conducting some fairly simple experiments which will provide useful information to the coach or athletic director as well as possibly to the psychologist and physiologist. 
These experiments may include different kinds of jumps (i.e., jumping off with one leg, the broad jump, or the Sargent jump) or varying the footwear used, the jumping surface or the rest period between jumps. 
It should also be possible with today's advances in photographic techniques and data analysis to improve and enlarge on Gerrish's work to the point where the jumping process could be analyzed reliably in varied situations.


In searching for references on the physics of jumping I came across an amusing book entitled <em>The Jump Book</em> (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1959) by the prize winning Life photographer Philippe Halsman, self-styled founder of the &ldquo;science&rdquo; of Jumpology. 
In describing and categorizing the jumps of the famous people who his synchronized camera caught up in the air, he jovally suggests that jumping could be used as a psychological test (<em>a la</em> Rorschach), and its analysis could constitute a new field of psychological investigation which he named Jumpology.

Although the persons in these photographs were evidently not instructed to jump for height, some of them did seem to reach for that goal. 
One of them was J. Robert Oppenheimer (Fig. 5). 
Who knows whether having students jump up in the physics laboratory might instantaneously identify a potentially great scientist. 
One might just compare the student's jump with the one by J.  Robert Oppenheimer.
