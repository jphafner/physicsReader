<span class="textsc">Musical</span> instruments are often classified under one of the following heads: strings, winds, rods, plates, and bells.
One who is more or less familiar with instruments will realize that most of these terms apply to the material part of each instrument set into vibration when the instrument is played.
It is the purpose of the first half of this chapter to consider these vibrating sources and the various factors governing the frequencies of their musical notes, and in the second part to take up in some detail the science of the musical scale.


<span class="textsc">16.1. Stringed Instruments.</span>
Under the classification of strings we find such instruments as the violin, cello, viola, double bass, harp, guitar, and piano.
There are two principal reasons why these instruments do not sound alike as regards tone quality, first, the design of the instrument, and second, the method by which the strings are set into vibration.
The violin and cello are bowed with long strands of tightly stretched horsehair, the harp and guitar are plucked with the fingers or picks, and the piano is hammered with light felt mallets.


Under very special conditions a string may be made to vibrate with nodes at either end as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:16A}.
In this state of motion the string gives rise to its lowest possible note, and it is said to be vibrating with its fundamental frequency.


Every musician knows that a thick heavy string has a lower natural pitch than a thin one, that a short strong string has a higher pitch than a long one, and that the tighter a string is stretched the higher is its pitch.
The G string of a violin, for example, is thicker and heavier than the high pitched E string, and the bass strings of the piano are longer and heavier than the strings of the treble.

Accurate measurements with vibrating strings, as well as theory, show that the frequency n is given by the following formula:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:16a}
    n = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{F}{m}}
\end{equation}


where <span class="math">L</span> is the distance in centimeters between two consecutive nodes, <span class="math">F</span> is the tension on the string in dynes, and <span class="math">m</span> the mass in grams of one centimeter length of string.
The equation gives the exact pitch of a string or the change in pitch due to a change in length, mass, or tension.
If the length <span class="math">L</span> is doubled the frequency is halved, i.e., the pitch is lowered one octave.
If <span class="math">m</span> is increased <span class="math">n</span> decreases, and if the tension <span class="math">F</span> is increased <span class="math">n</span> increases.
The formula shows that to double the frequency by tightening a string the tension must be increased fourfold.

<span class="textsc">16.2. Harmonics and Overtones.</span>
When a professional violinist plays &ldquo;in harmonics&rdquo; he touches the strings lightly at various points and sets each one vibrating in two or more segments as shown in
Fig. 16B.
If a string is touched at the center a node is formed at that point and the vibration frequency, as shown by Eq. (\ref{eq:16a}), becomes just double that of the fundamental.
If the string is touched lightly at a point just one-third the distance from the end it will vibrate in three sections and have a frequency three times that of the fundamental.
These higher vibration modes as shown in the figures, which always have frequencies equal to whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency <span class="math">n</span>, are called overtones.


It is a simple matter to set a string vibrating with its fundamental frequency and several overtones simultaneously.
This is accomplished by plucking or bowing the string vigorously.
To illustrate this, a diagram of a string vibrating with its fundamental and first overtone is shown in Fig. 16C. As the string vibrates with a node at the center and a frequency <span class="math">2n</span>, it also moves up and down as a whole with the fundamental frequency <span class="math">n</span> and a node at each end.

<figure>
\label{fig:16C}
\caption{String vibrating with its fundamental and first overtone simulataneously.}
</figure>


It should be pointed out that a string set into vibration with nodes and loops is but an example of standing waves, see Figs. 14K and 14L.
Vibrations produced at one end of a string send a continuous train of waves along the string to be reflected back from the other end.
This is true not only for transverse waves but for longitudinal or torsional waves as well.
Standing waves of the latter two types can be demonstrated by stroking or twisting one end of the string of a sonometer or violin with a rosined cloth.


<span class="textsc">16.3. Wind Instruments</span>.
Musical instruments often classified as &ldquo;wind instruments&rdquo; are usually divided into two subclasses, &ldquo;wood-winds&rdquo; and &ldquo;brasses.&rdquo;
Under the heading of wood-winds we find such instruments as the flute, piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, and contra bassoon, and under the brasses such instruments as the French horn, cornet, trumpet, tenor trombone, bass trombone, and tuba (or bombardon).


In practically all wind instruments the source of sound is a vibrating air column, set into and maintained in a state of vibration by one of several different principles.
In instruments like the saxophone, clarinet, and bassoon, air is blown against a thin strip of wood called a reed, setting it into vibration.
In most of the brasses the musician&#39;s lips are made to vibrate with certain required frequencies, while in certain wood-winds like the flute and piccolo air is blown across the sharp edge of an opening near one end of the instrument setting the air into vibration.


The fundamental principles involved in the vibration of an air column are demonstrated by means of an experiment shown in Fig. \ref{fig:16D}.
A vibrating tuning fork acting as a source of sound waves is held over the open end of several long hollow tubes.
Traveling down the tube with the velocity of sound in air, each train of sound waves is reflected from the bottom back toward the top.
If the tube is adjusted to the proper length, standing waves will be set up and the air column will resonate to the frequency of the tuning fork.
In this experiment the proper length of the tube for the closed pipes is obtained by slowly pouring water into the cylinder and listening for the loudest response.
Experimentally, this occurs at several points as indicated by the first three diagrams; the first resonance occurs at a distance of one and onequarter wave-lengths, the second at three-quarters of a wave-length, and the third at one-quarter of a wave-length.
The reason for these odd fractions is that only a node can form at the closed end of a pipe and a loop at an open end.
This is true of all wind instruments.


<figure>
\label{fig:16D}
\caption{The column of air in a pipe will resonate to sound of a given pitch if the length of the pipe is properly adjusted.}
</figure>

For open pipes a loop forms at both ends with one or more nodes in between.
The first five pipes in Fig. \ref{fig:16D} are shown responding to a tuning fork of the same frequency.
The sixth pipe, diagram (<span class="math">f</span>), is the same length as (<span class="math">d</span>) but is responding to a fork of twice the frequency of the others.
This note is one octave higher in pitch.
In other words, a pipe of given length can be made to resonate to various frequencies.
Closed pipe (a), for example, will respond to other forks whose waves are of the right length to form a node at the bottom, a loop at the top and any number of nodes in between.


The existence of standing waves in a resonating air column may be demonstrated by a long hollow tube filled with illuminating gas as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:16E}.
Entering through an adjustable plunger at the left the gas escapes through tiny holes spaced at regular intervals in a row along the top.
Sound waves from an organ pipe enter the gas column by setting into vibration a thin rubber sheet stretched over the righthand end.
When resonance is attained by sliding the plunger to the correct position, the small gas flames will appear as shown.
Where the nodes occur in the vibrating gas column the air molecules are not moving, see Fig. 14L (b);
    at these points the pressure is high and the flames are tallest.
Half way between are the loops; regions where the molecules vibrate back and forth with large amplitudes, and the flames are low.
Bernoulli&#39;s principle is chiefly responsible for the pressure differences, see Sec. 10.8, for where the velocity of the molecules is high the pressure is low, and where the velocity is low the pressure is high.


<figure>
\label{fig:16E}
\caption{Standing waves in a long tube containing illuminating gas.}
</figure>

The various notes produced by most wind instruments are brought about by varying the length of the vibrating air column.
This is illustrated by the organ pipes in Fig. \ref{fig:16F}.
The longer the air column the lower the frequency or pitch of the note.
In a regular concert organ the pipes vary in length from about six inches for the highest note to almost sixteen feet for the lowest.
For the middle octave of the musical scale the open-ended pipes vary from two feet for middlt C to one foot for O- one octave higher.
In the wood-winds like the flute the length of the column is varied by openings in the side of the instrument and in many of the brasses like the trumpet, by means of valves.
A valve is a piston which on being pressed down throws in an additional length of tube.


The frequency of a vibrating air column is given by the following formula,

\begin{equation*}
    n = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{K\frac{p}{d}}
\end{equation*}

where <span class="math">L</span> is the length of the air column, <span class="math">K</span> is a number representing the compressibility of the gas, <span class="math">p</span> is the pressure of the gas, and <span class="math">d</span> is its density.
The function of each factor in this equation has been verified by numerous experiments.
The effect of the length <span class="math">L</span> is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:16F}.
To lower the frequency to half-value the length must be doubled.
The effect of the density of a gas on the pitch of a note may be demonstrated by a very interesting experiment with the human voice.
Voice sounds originate in the vibrations of the vocal cords in the larynx.
The pitch of this source of vibration is controlled by muscular tension on the cords, while the quality is determined by the size and shape of the throat and mouth cavities.
If a gas lighter than air is breathed into the lungs and vocal cavities, the above equation shows that the voice should have a higher pitch.
The demonstration can be best and most safely performed by breathing helium gas, whose effect is to raise the voice about two and one-half octaves.
The experiment must be performed to be fully appreciated.

<span class="textsc">16.4. Edge Tones</span>.
When wind or a blast of air encounters a small obstacle, little whirlwinds are formed in the air stream behind the obstacle.
This is illustrated by the cross-section of a flue organ pipe in Fig. \ref{fig:16G}.
Whether the obstacle is long, or a small round object, the whirlwinds are formed alternately on the two sides as shown.
The air stream at <span class="math">B</span> waves back and forth, sending a pulse of air first up one side and then the other.
Although the wind blows through the opening <span class="math">A</span> a.s a. continuous stream, the separate whirlwinds going
up each side of the obstacle become periodic shocks to the surrounding air.
Coming at perfectly regular intervals these pulses give rise to a musical note often described as the whistling of the wind.
These notes are called &ldquo;edge tones.&rdquo;

The number of whirlwinds formed per second, and therefore the pitch of the edge tone, increases flue with the wind velocity.
When the wind howls through the trees the pitch of the note rises and falls, its frequency at any time denoting the velocity of the wind.
For a given wind velocity smaller objects give rise to higher pitched notes than large objects.
A fine stretched wire or rubber band when placed in an open window or in the wind will be set into vibration and give out a musical note.
Each whirlwind shock to the air reacts on the obstacle (the wire or rubber band), pushing it first to one side and then the other.
These are the pushes that cause the reed of a musical instrument to vibrate and the rope of a flagpole to flap periodically in the breeze, while the waving of the flag at the top of a pole shows the whirlwinds that follow each other along each side. 


These motions are all &ldquo;forced vibrations&rdquo; in that they are forced by the wind.
A stretched string or the air column in an organ pipe has its own natural across the lip of an frequency of vibration which may or may not coincide with the frequency of the edge tone.
If they do sides of the partition, coincide, resonance will occur, the string or air column will vibrate with a large amplitude, and a loud sound will result.
If the edge tone has a diff^erent frequency than the fundamental of the string, or air column, vibrations will be set up but not as intensely as before.
If the frequency of the edge tone of an organ pipe, for example, becomes double that of the fundamental, and this can be obtained by a stronger blast of air, the pipe will resonate to double its fundamental frequency and give out a note one octave higher.


<span class="textsc">16.5. Vibrating Rods</span>.
If a number of small sticks are dropped upon the floor the sound that is heard is described as a noise.
If one stick alone is dropped one would also describe the sound as a noise, unless, of course, a set of sticks of varying lengths are arranged in order of length and each one dropped in its order.
If this is done, one notices that each stick gives rise to a rather delinite musical note and the set of sticks to a musical scale.
The use of vibrating rods in the design of a musical instrument is to be found in the <em>xylophone</em> the <em>marimba</em>, and the <em>triangle</em>.
Standing waves in a rod, like those in a stretched string, may be any one of three different kinds, transverse, longitudinal, and torsional.
Only the first two of these modes of vibration will be treated here.


Transverse waves in a rod are usually set up by supporting the rod at points near each end and striking it a blow at or near the center.
As illustrated in Fig. l6H(a) the center and ends of the rod move up and down, forming nodes at the two supports.
Like a stretched string of a musical instrument, the shorter the rod the higher is its pitch, and the longer and heavier the rod the lower is its frequency of vibration and pitch.


<figure>
\label{fig:16H}
\caption{The bars of the marimba or xylophone vibrate transversely with nodes near each end. }
</figure>


The <em>xylophone</em> is a musical instrument based upon the transverse vibrations of wooden rods of different lengths.
Mounted as shown in Fig. l6H(b) the longer rods produce the low notes and the shorter ones the higher notes.
The marimba is essentially a xylophone with a long, straight hollow tube suspended vertically under each rod.
Each tube is cut to such a length that the enclosed air column will resonate to the sound waves sent out by the rod directly above.
Each resonator tube, being open at both ends, forms a node at its center.


Longitudinal vibrations in a rod may be set up by clamping a rod at one end or near the center and stroking it with a rosined cloth.
Clamped in the middle as sliown in Fig. \ref{fig:161} the free ends of the rod move back and forth while the middle is held motionless, maintaining a node at that point.
Since the vibrations are too small to be seen with the eye a small ivory ball is suspended near the end as shown.
The bouncing of this ball is indicative of the strong longitudinal vibrations.
This type of vibration in a rod is not used in musical instruments.

<span class="textsc">16.6 Vibrating Plates</span>.
Although the drum or the cymbals should hardly be called musical instruments they are classified as such and made use of in nearly all large orchestras and bands.
The noise given out by a vibrating drumhead or cymbal plate is in general due to the high intensity of certain characteristic overtones.
These overtones in turn are due to the very complicated modes of vibration of the source.


Cymbals consist of two thin metal disks with handles at the centers.
Upon being struck together their edges are set into vibration with a clang.
A drumhead, on the other hand, is a stretched membrane of leather held tight at the periphery and is set into vibration by being struck a blow at or near the center.


<figure>
\label{fig:16J}
\caption{
    Chladni&#39;s sand figures showing the nodes and loops of (a) a vibrating drumhead (clamped at the edge) and (b) a vibrating cymbal plate (clamped at the center).
}
</figure>

To illustrate the complexity of the vibrations of a circular plate, two typical sand patterns are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:16J}.
The sand pattern method of studying the motions of plates was invented in the 18th century by Chladni, a German physicist.
A thin circular metal plate is clamped at the center C and sand sprinkled over the top surface.
Then while touching the rim of the plate at two points <span class="math">N_1</span> and <span class="math">N_2</span> a violin bow is drawn down over the edge at a point <span class="math">L</span>.
Nodes are formed at the stationary points <span class="math">N_1</span> and <span class="math">N_2</span> and loops in the regions of <span class="math">L_1</span> and <span class="math">L_2</span>.
The grains of sand bounce away from the loops and into the nodes, the regions of no motion.
At one instant the regions marked with a $+$ sign all move up, while the regions marked with a $-$ sign all move down.
Half a vibration later the $+$ regions are moving down and the $-$ regions up.
Such diagrams are called Chladni&#39;s sand figures.


With cymbal plates held tightly at the center by means of handles a node is always formed there, and loops are always formed at the periphery.
With a drumhead, on the other hand, the periphery is always a node and the center is sometimes but not always a loop. 


<span class="textsc">16.7. Bells.</span> In some respects a bell is like a cymbal plate, for
when it is struck a blow by the clapper, the rim in particular is set vibrating with nodes and loops distributed in a symmetrical pattern over the whole surface.
The vibration of the rim is illustrated by a diagram in Fig. \ref{fig:16Ka} and by an experiment in diagram (b).
Small cork balls are suspended by threads around and just touching the outside rim of a large glass bowl.
A violin bow drawn across the edge of the bowl will set the rim into vibration with nodes at some points and loops at others.
The nodes are always even in number just as they are in cymbal plates and drumheads, and alternate loops move in while the others move out.


<figure>
\label{fig:16K}
\caption{Experiment illustrating that the rim of a bell or glass vibrates with nodes and loops.}
</figure>


Strictly speaking, a bell is not a very musical instrument.
This is due to the very complex vibrations of the bell surface giving rise to so many loud overtones.
Some of these overtones harmonize with the fundamental while others are discordant.


<span class="textsc">16.8. The Musical Scale.</span>
The musical scale is based upon the relative frequencies of different sound waves.
The frequencies are so chosen that they produce the greatest amount of harmony.
Two notes are said to be harmonious if they are pleasant to hear.
If they are not pleasant to hear they are discordant.


The general form of the musical scale is illustrated by the symbols, letters, terms, and simple fractions given in Fig. \ref{fig:16L}.

<figure>
\label{fig:16L}
\caption{Diagram giving the names, and fractional ratios of the frequencies, of the different tone intervals on the diatonic musical scale.}
</figure>


The numbers indicate that whatever the frequency of the toriic <span class="math">C</span>, the frequency of the octave <span class="math">C</span>
will be twice as great, that G will be three halves as great, F four thirds as great, etc.
These fractions below each note are proportional to their frequencies in whatever octave of the musical scale the notes are located.


The musical pitch of an orchestral scale is usually determined by specifying the frequency of the A string of the first violin, although sometimes it is given by middle C on the piano.
In the history of modern music the standard of pitch has varied so widely and changed so frequently that no set pitch can universally be called standard.
\footnote{
    For a brief historical discussion of normal standards of pitch the student is referred to the book &ldquo;The Science of Musical Sounds&rdquo; by D.  C. Miller.
    For other treatments of the science of music see &ldquo;Sound&rdquo; by Capstick, &ldquo;Science and Music&rdquo; by James Jeans, and "Sound and Music" by J. A. Zahn.
}
For many scientific purposes the A string of the violin is tuned to a
frequency of 440 vib/sec, while in a few cases the slightly different
scale of 256 vib/sec is used for the tonic, sometimes called middle C.

<span class="textsc">16.9. The Diatonic Scale.</span>
The middle octave of the diatonic musical scale is given in Fig. \ref{fig:16M} assuming as a standard of pitch A = 440. The vocal notes usually sung in practicing music are given in the second row.
The ratio numbers are the smallest whole numbers proportional to the scale ratios and to the actual frequencies.


The tone ratios given at the bottom of the scale indicate the ratio between the frequencies of two consecutive notes.
Major tones have a ratio of 8 : 9, minor tones a ratio of 9 : 10, and diatonic semitones a ratio 15 : 16. (The major and minor tones on a piano are called whole tones and the semitones are called half tones.)

Other tone intervals of interest to the musician are the following:

\begin{tabu}{X[l]cl}
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Interval} &
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Frequency Ratio} &
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{Examples} \\
    Octave  & 1:2 & CO, DD, EE \\
    Fifth   & 2:3 & CG, EB, GD \\
    Fourth  & 3:4 & CF, EA, GC \\
    Major third     & 4:5 & CE, FA, GB  \\
    Minor third     & 5:6 & EG, AC  \\
    Major sixth     & 3:5 & CA, DB, GE \\
    Minor sixth     & 5:8 & EC, AF \\
\end{tabu}

A scientific study of musical notes and tone intervals shows that harmony is based upon the frequency ratios between notes.
The smaller the whole numbers giving the ratio between the frequencies of two notes the more harmonious, or consonant, is the resultant.
Under this definition of harmony the octave, with a frequency ratio of $1:2$, is the most harmonious.
Next in Hne comes the fifth with a ratio $2:3$, followed by the fourth with $3:4$, etc.
The larger the whole numbers the more <em>discordant</em>, or <em>dissonant</em>, is the interval.

Helmholtz was the first to giwQ a physical explanation of the various degrees of consonance and harmony of these different intervals.
It is based in part upon the beat notes produced by two notes of the interval.


As shown by Eq. (\ref{eq:15a}) the <em>beat frequency</em> between two notes is equal to their frequency difference.
Consider, for example, the two notes C and G of the middle octave in Fig. \ref{fig:16M}.
Having frequencies of 264 and 396, the beat frequency is the difference, or 132.
This is a frequency fast enough to be heard by the ear as a separate note, and in pitch is one octave below <em>middle</em> C.
Thus in sounding the <em>fifth</em>, C and G, three harmonious notes are heard, 132, 264, 396.
They are harmonious because they have ratios given by the smallest whole numbers  1:2:3.


Harmonious <em>triads or chords</em> are formed by three separate notes each of which forms a harmonious interval with the other two, Avhile the highest and lowest notes are less than an octave apart.
Since there are but six such triads they are shown below.


\begin{table}
\begin{tabu}
    Major third followed by minor third 4

" fourth 3

Minor third " " major third 5

Minor third " " fourth 5

Fourth " " major third 4

Fourth " " minor third 3

\begin{table}
\begin{tabu}



Consider the beat notes or difference tones between the various pairs of notes in the second triad above.
The notes themselves have frequencies $C=264$, $F=352$, and $G=440$.
The difference tones $F-C=88$, $A-F=88$, and $A-C=176$.
Being exactly one and two octaves below <span class="math">C</span>, one of the notes of the triad, they are in harmony with each other. 
Grouping the first two beat frequencies as a single note, all the frequencies heard by the ear have the frequencies 88, 176, 264, 352, and 440. 
The frequency ratios of these notes are 1:2:3:4:5, the first five positive whole numbers.


<span class="textsc">16.10. The Chromatic Scale.</span>
Contrary to the belief of many people the sharp of one note and the jiat of the next higher major or minor tone are not of the same pitch.
The reason for this false impression is that on the piano the black keys represent a compromise.
The piano is not tuned to the diatonic scale but to an equal tempered scale.
Experiments with eminent musicians, and particularly violinists, have shown that they play in what is called pure intonation, that is, to a chromatic scale and not according to equal temperament as will be described in the next section.


On the <em>chromatic scale</em> of the musician the ratio between the frequency of one note and the frequency of its sharp or <em>flat</em> is $25:24$.
This ratio is just the difference between a diatonic semitone and a minor tone. i.e. $\frac{15}{16} \div \frac{9}{10} = \frac{25}{24}$.
The actual frequencies of the various sharps and flats for the middle octave of the chromatic scale, based upon $A=440$, are shown above in Fig. \ref{fig:16N}.
C$\sharp$ for example has a frequency of 275 whereas D$\flat$ is 285.1. 
This is a difference of 10 vib/sec, an interval easily recognized at this pitch by most everyone. 
(The sharps and flats of the semitone intervals are not shown.)

<figure>
\label{fig:16O}
\caption{The equal tempered scale of the piano illustrating the frequencies of the middle octave based upon $A=440$ as the standard pitch.}
</figure>


<span class="textsc">16.11. The Equal Tempered Scale.</span>
The white keys of the piano are not tuned to the exact frequency ratios of the diatonic scale; they are tuned to an equal tempered scale. 
Each octave is divided into twelve equal ratio intervals as illustrated below in Fig. \ref{fig:16N}. 
The whole tone and half tone intervals shown represent the white keys of the piano, as indicated in Fig. 160, and the sharps and flats represent the black keys. 
Including the black keys, all twelve tone intervals in every octave are exactly the same. 
The frequency of any note in the equal tempered scale turns out to be 6 percent higher than the one preceding it. 
More accurately, the frequency of any one note multiplied by the decimal $1.05946$ gives the frequency of the note one-half tone higher. 
For example, $A=440$ multiplied by $1.05946$ gives $A^{\sharp}$ or $B^{\flat}$ as 466.1 vib/ sec. 
Similarly, $466.1 \times 1.05946$ gives $493.9$.


The reason for tuning the piano to an equal tempered scale is to enable the pianist to play in any key and yet stay within a given pitch range. 
In so doing, any given composition can be played within the range of a given person&#39;s voice. 
In other words, any single note can be taken as the tonic of the musical scale.


Although the notes of the piano are not quite as harmonious as if they were tuned to a diatonic scale, they are not far out of tune. 
This can be seen by a comparison of the actual frequencies of the notes of the two scales in Fig. \ref{fig:16N}.
The maximum differences amount to about 1 percent, which for many people is not noticeable, particularly in a modern dance orchestra. 
To the average musician, however, the difference is too great to be tolerated, and this is the reason most symphony orchestras do not include a piano. 
The orchestral instruments are usually tuned to the A string of the first violin and played according to the chromatic and diatonic scale.


<span class="textsc">16.12. Quality of Musical Notes.</span>
Although two musical notes have the same pitch and intensity they may differ widely in tone quality.
Tone quality is determined by the number and intensity of the overtones present. 
This is illustrated by an examination either of the vibrating source or of the sound waves emerging from the source. 
There are numerous experimental methods by which this is accomplished.


A relatively convenient and simple demonstration is given in Fig. \ref{fig:16P}, where the vibrating source of sound is a stretched piano string. 
Light from an arc lamp is passed over the central section of the string which, except for a small vertical slot, is masked by a screen.
As the string vibrates up and down the only visible image of the string is a very short section as shown at the right, and this appears blurred.
By reflecting the light in a rotating mirror the section of wire draws out a wave <span class="math">W</span> on a distant screen.


If a string is made to vibrate with its fundamental alone, its own motion or that of the emitted sound waves have the form shown in diagram (a) of Fig. \ref{fig:16Q}. 
If it vibrates in two segments or six segments (see Fig. 16B) the wave forms will be like those in diagrams (b) and (c) respectively. 
Should the string be set vibrating with its fundamental and first overtone simultaneously, the wave form will appear something like diagram (d). 
This curve is the sum of (a) and (b) and is obtained graphically by adding the displacement of corresponding points. 
If in addition to the fundamental a string vibrates with the first and fifth overtones the wave will look like diagram (e). 
This is like diagram (d) with the fifth overtone added to it.

It is difficult to make a string vibrate with its fundamental alone.
As a rule there are many overtones present. 
Some of these overtones harmonize with the fundamental and some do not. 
Those which harmonize are called harmonic overtones, and those which do not are called anharmomc overtones. 
If middle $C=264$ is sounded with its first eight overtones, they will have 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 times 264 vib/sec. 
These on the diatonic scale will correspond to notes $C^1$, $G^1$, $C^2$, $E^2$, $G^2$, <span class="math">X</span>, and $C^3$.
All of these except <span class="math">X</span>, the sixth overtone, belongs to some harmonic triad. 
This sixth overtone is anharmonic and should be suppressed. 
In a piano this is accomplished by striking the string one-seventh of its length from one end, thus preventing a node at that point.

<span class="textsc">16.13. The Ranges of Musical Instruments.</span>
The various octaves above the middle of the musical scale are often labeled with numerical superscripts as already illustrated, while the octaves below the middle are labeled with numerical subscripts.

The top curve in Fig. \ref{fig:16Q} is typical of the sound wave from a tuning fork, whereas the lower one is more like that from a violin.
The strings of a violin are tuned to intervals of the <em>fifth</em>, $G_1=198$, $D=297$, $A=440$, and $E^1=660$.
The various notes of the musical scale are obtained by touching a string at various points, thus shortening the section which vibrates. 
The lowest note reached is with the untouched <span class="math">G_1</span> string and the highest notes by the $E^1$ string fingered about two-thirds of the way up toward the bridge. 
This gives the violin a playing range, or compass, of $3\frac{1}{2}$ octaves, from $G_1=198$ to $C^3=2112$.

The <em>viola</em> is slightly larger in size than the violin but has the same shape and is played with slightly lower pitch and more sombre tone quality. 
Reaching from <span class="math">C_1</span> to $C^2$, it has a range of three octaves.


The cello is a light bass violin which rests on the floor, is played with a bow, has four strings pitched one octave lower than the viola, <span class="math">C_2</span>, <span class="math">G_2</span>, <span class="math">D_1</span>, and <span class="math">A_1</span>, and has a heavy rich tone quality. 
The double bass is the largest of the violin family, rests on the floor and is played with a bow. 
The strings are tuned to two octaves below the viola and
one octave below the cello. In modern dance orchestras the bow is
often discarded and the strings are plucked with the fingers.


Of the wood-wind instruments the jlute is nearest to the human voice. 
It consists essentially (see Fig. \ref{fig:16R}) of a straight narrow tube about 2 feet long and is played by blowing air from between the lips across a small hole near the closed end. 
The openings along the tube are for the purpose of terminating the vibrating air column at various points.
See Fig. \ref{fig:16F}. 
With all holes closed a loop forms at both ends with a node in the middle. 
See Fig. \ref{fig:16D}(d). 
As each hole is opened one after the other, starting from the open end, the vibrating air column with a loop at the opening grows shorter and shorter, giving out higher and higher notes. 
To play the scale one octave higher, one blows harder to increase the frequency of the edge tones and set the air column vibrating, as in Fig. \ref{fig:16D}(e), with three loops and two nodes. 
Starting at middle C the flute can be extended in pitch for two octaves, up to $C^2$.
The piccolo is a small flute, 1 foot long, and sings one octave higher. 
%% NOTE: iis in in original text
The tone is shrill and piercing and the compass iis $C^1$ to $A^2$.

The oboe is a melodic double-reed keyed instrument, straight and about 2 feet long. 
It has a reedy yet beautiful quality, and starting at <span class="math">B_1</span> has a range of about two octaves. 
The clarinet, sometimes called the violin of the mihtary band (see Fig. \ref{fig:16R}), is a single-reed instrument about 3 feet long. 
It has a range of over three octaves starting at <span class="math">E_1</span>.
The bass clarinet is larger than the clarinet, but has the same shape and plays one octave lower in pitch.

The bassoon is a bass double-reed keyed instrument about 4 feet long. 
The tone is nasal and the range is about two octaves starting at $B^{\flat}$.

The <em>horn</em> is a coiled brass tube about 12 feet in length (see Fig. 16R) but interchangeable according to the number of crooks used. 
It has a soft mellow tone and starting at <span class="math">C_2</span> has a range of three octaves.
The cornet, not usually used in symphony orchestras (see Fig. \ref{fig:16R}), is a coiled conical tube about 41/2 feet long with three valves. 
It has a mellow tone starting at middle <span class="math">C</span> and extends for two octaves. 
The trumpet is a brass instrument having a similar shape as, and slightly larger than, the cornet. 
Having three valves, it extends to two octaves above middle <span class="math">C</span>.
The purpose of the valves is to vary the length of the vibrating air column.


The trombone is a brass instrument played with a slide, is a conical tube about 9 feet long when straightened (see Fig. 16R), and has a tone range from <span class="math">F_2</span> to $C^1$.
Since the length of the vibrating air column can be varied at will it is easily played to the chromatic scale. 
The tuba is the largest of the saxhorns and has a range from <span class="math">F_3</span> to <span class="math">F_1</span>.

The bugle (see Fig. \ref{fig:16R}) is not capable of playing to the musical scale but sounds only certain notes. 
These notes are the harmonic overtones of a fundamental frequency of about GG vibrations per second. 
With a loop at the mouthpiece, a node in the center, and a loop at the flared end, this requires a tube 8 feet long. 
The second, third, fourth, and fifth overtones have the frequencies $66 \times 3 = 198$, $66 \times 4=264$, $66 \times5 = 330$, and $66 \times 6 =396$ corresponding to <span class="math">G_1</span>, <span class="math">C</span>, <span class="math">E</span>, and <span class="math">G</span>, the notes of the bugle. 
By making the lips vibrate to near these frequencies the air column is set resonating with 3, 4, 5, or 6 nodes between the two open ends.


<span class="textsc">16.14. The Phonodeik.</span>
The phonodeik is an instrument designed by D. C. Miller for photographing the minute details and wave forms of all audible sounds. 
The instrument consists of a sensitive diaphragm <span class="math">D</span> (see Fig. \ref{fig:16S}), against which the sound waves to be studied are allowed to fall. 
As the diaphragm vibrates back and forth under the impulses of the sound waves the thread <span class="math">T</span> winds and unwinds on the spindle <span class="math">S</span>, turning the tiny mirror <span class="math">M</span> up and down. 
A beam of light from an arc lamp <span class="math">A</span> and lens <span class="math">L</span> is reflected from this mirror onto a rotating mirror RAi. 
As <span class="math">RM</span> spins around the light sweeps across a distant screen, tracing out the sound wave. 
The trace may be either photographed or observed directly on the screen. 
Persistence of vision enables the whole curve to be seen for a fraction of a second.


Several sound curves photographed by Miller are redrawn in Fig. \ref{fig:16T}.
In every graph except the one of the piano, the sound is maintained at the same frequency so that the form of each wave, no matter how complex, is repeated the same number of times. 
The tuning fork is the one instrument which is readily set vibrating with its fundamental alone and none of its harmonics. 
Although each different instrument may sound out with the same note, that is, the same fundamental, the various overtones present and their relative loudness determines the quality of the note identified with that instrument.
