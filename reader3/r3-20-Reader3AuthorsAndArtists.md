The first 10 years of Leonardo&#39;s career were devoted to painting, culminating in the &ldquo;Adoration of the Magi.&rdquo;
Defensive to criticisms on his being &ldquo;unlettered,&rdquo; Leonardo emphasized his ability as inventor and engineer, becoming a fortification expert for the militarist Cesare Borgia.
By 1503 he was working as on artist in almost every field.
&ldquo;Mono Lisa&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Last Supper&rdquo; are among the world&#39;s most famous paintings.

His prolific life terminated in the Castle of Cloux near Amboise on May 2, 1519.
