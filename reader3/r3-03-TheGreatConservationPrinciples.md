When learning about the laws of physics you find that there are a large number of complicated and detailed laws, laws of gravitation, of electricity and magnetism, nuclear interactions, and so on, but across the variety of these detailed laws there sweep great general principles which all the laws seem to follow.
Examples of these are the principles of conservation, certain qualities of symmetry, the general form of quantum mechanical principles, and unhappily, or happily, as we considered last time, the fact that all the laws are mathematical.
In this lecture I want to talk about the conservation principles.

The physicist uses ordinary words in a peculiar manner.
To him a conservation law means that there is a number which you can calculate at one moment, then as nature undergoes its multitude of changes, if you calculate this quantity again at a later time it will be the same as it was before, the number does not change. An example is the conservation of energy.
There is a quantity that you can calculate according to a certain rule, and it comes out the same answer always, no matter what happens.

Now you can see that such a thing is possibly useful.
Suppose that physics, or rather nature, is considered analogous to a great chess game with millions of pieces in it, and we are trying to discover the laws by which the pieces move.
The great gods who play this chess play it very rapidly, and it is hard to watch and difficult to see.
However, we are catching on to some of the rules, and there are some rules which we can work out which do not require that we watch every move.
For instance, suppose there is one bishop only, a red bishop, on the board, then since the bishop moves diagonally and therefore never changes the colour of its square, if we look away for a moment while the gods play and then look back again, we can expect that there will be still a red bishop on the board, maybe in a different place, but on the same colour square.
This is in the nature of a conservation law.
We do not need to watch the insides to know at least something about the game.

It is true that in chess this particular law is not necessarily perfectly valid.
If we looked away long enough it could happen that the bishop was captured, a pawn went down to queen, and the god decided that it was better to hold a bishop instead of a queen in the place of that pawn, which happened to be on a black square.
Unfortunately it may well turn out that some of the laws which we see today may not be exactly perfect, but I will tell you about them as we see them at present.

I have said that we use ordinary words in a technical fashion, and another word in the title of this lecture is &lsquo;great&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Great Conservation Principles&rsquo;.
This is not a technical word: it was merely put in to make the title sound more dramatic, and I could just as well have called it &lsquo;The Conservation Laws&rsquo;.
There are a few conservation laws that do not work; they are only approximately right, but are sometimes useful, and we might call those the &lsquo;little&rsquo; conservation laws.
I will mention later one or two of those that do not work, but the principal ones that I am going to discuss are, as far as we can tell today, absolutely accurate.

I will start with the easiest one to understand, and that is the conservation of electric charge.
There is a number, the total electric charge in the world, which, no matter what happens, does not change. If you lose it in one place you will find it in another.
The conservation is of the total of all electric charge.
This was discovered experimentally by Faraday[^1].
The experiment consisted of getting inside a great globe of metal, on the outside of which was a very delicate galvanometer, to look for the charge on the globe, because a small amount of charge would make a big effect.
Inside the globe Faraday built all kinds of weird electrical equipment.
He made charges by rubbing glass rods with cat&#39;s fur, and he made big electrostatic machines so that the inside of this globe looked like those horror movie laboratories.
But during all these experiments no charge developed on the surface; there was no net charge made.
Although the glass rod may have been positive after it was charged up by rubbing on the cat&#39;s fur, then the fur would be the same amount negative, and the total charge was always nothing, because if there were any charge developed on the inside of the globe it would have appeared as an effect in the galvanometer on the outside.
So the total charge is conserved.


This is easy to understand, because a very simple model, which is not mathematical at all, will explain it.
Suppose the world is made of only two kinds of particles, electrons and protons&mdash;there was a time when it looked as if it was going to be as easy as that&mdash;and suppose that the electrons carry a negative charge and the protons a positive charge, so that we can separate them.
We can take a piece of matter and put on more electrons, or take some off; but supposing that electrons are permanent and never disintegrate or disappear&mdash;that is a simple proposition, not even mathematical&mdash;then the total number of protons, less the total number of electrons, will not change.
In fact in this particular model the total number of protons will not change, nor the number of electrons.
But we are concentrating now on the charge.
The contribution of the protons is positive and that of the electrons negative, and if these objects are never created or destroyed alone then the total charge will be conserved.
I want to list as I go on the number of properties that conserve quantities, and I will start with charge (fig. 14).
Against the question whether charge is conserved I write &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.

This theoretical interpretation is very simple, but it was later discovered that electrons and protons are not permanent;
    for example, a particle called the neutron can disintegrate into a proton and an electron&mdash;plus something else which we will come to.
But the neutron, it turns out, is electrically neutral.
So although protons are not permanent, nor are electrons permanent, in the sense that they can be created from a neutron, the charge still checks out;
    starting before, we had zero charge, and afterwards we had plus one and minus one which when added together become zero charge.

An example of a similar fact is that there exists another particle, besides the proton, which is positively charged.
It is called a positron, which is a kind of image of an electron.
It is just like the electron in most respects, except that it has the opposite sign of charge, and, more important, it is called an anti-particle because when it meets with an electron the two of them can annihilate each other and disintegrate, and nothing but light comes out.
So electrons are not permanent even by themselves.
An electron plus a positron will just make light.
Actually the &lsquo;light&rsquo; is invisible to the eye; it is gamma rays; but this is the same thing for a physicist, only the wavelength is different.
So a particle and its anti-particle can annihilate.
The light has no electric charge, but we remove one positive and one negative charge, so we have not changed the total charge.
The theory of conservation of charge is therefore slightly more complicated but still very unmathematical.
You simply add together the number of positrons you have and the number of protons, take away the number of electrons&mdash;there are additional particles you have to check, for example antiprotons which contribute negatively, pi-plus mesons which are positive, in fact each fundamental particle in nature has a charge (possibly zero).
All we have to do is add up the total number, and whatever happens in any reaction the total amount of charge on one side has to balance with the amount on the other side.

That is one aspect of the conservation of charge.
Now comes an interesting question.
Is it sufficient to say only that charge is conserved, or do we have to say more?
If charge were conserved because it was a real particle which moved around it would have a very special property.
The total amount of charge in a box might stay the same in two ways.
It may be that the charge moves from one place to another within the box.
But another possibility is that the charge in one place disappears, and simultaneously charge arises in another place, instantaneously related, and in such a manner that the total charge is never changing.
This second possibility for the conservation is of a different kind from the first, in which if a charge disappears in one place and turns up in another something has to travel through the space in between.
The second form of charge conservation is called local charge conservation, and is far more detailed than the simple remark that the total charge does not change.
So you see we are improving our law, if it is true that charge is locally conserved.
In fact it is true.
I have tried to show you from time to time some of the possibilities of reasoning, of interconnecting one idea with another, and I would now like to describe to you an argument, fundamentally due to Einstein, which indicates that if anything is conserved&mdash;and in this case I apply it to charge&mdash;it must be conserved locally.
This argument relies on one thing, that if two fellows are passing each other in space ships, the question of which guy is doing the moving and which one standing still cannot be resolved by any experiment.
That is called the principle of relativity, that uniform motion in a straight line is relative, and that we can look at any phenomenon from either point of view and cannot say which one is standing still and which one is moving.

Suppose I have two space ships, <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> (fig. \ref{:fig:15}).
I am going to take the point of view that <span class="math">A</span> is the one that is moving past <span class="math">B</span>.
Remember that is just an opinion, you can also look it at the other way and you will get the same phenomena of nature.
Now suppose that the man who is standing still wants to argue whether or not he has seen a charge at one end of his ship disappear and a charge at the other end appear at the same time.
In order to make sure it is the same time he cannot sit in the front of the ship, because he will see one before he sees the other because of the travel time of light; so let us suppose that he is very careful and sits dead centre in the middle of the ship.
We have another man doing the same kind of observation in the other ship.
Now a lightning bolt strikes, and charge is created at point <span class="math">x</span>, and at the same instant at point <span class="math">y</span> at the other end of the ship the charge is annihilated, it disappears.
At the same instant, note, and perfectly consistent with our idea that charge is conserved.
If we lose one electron in one place we get another elsewhere, but nothing passes in between.
Let us suppose that when the charge disappears there is a flash, and when it is created there is a flash, so that we can see what happens.
<span class="math">B</span> says they both happen at the same time, since he knows he is in the middle of the ship and the light from the bolt which creates <span class="math">x</span> reaches him at the same time as the light from the flash of disappearance at <span class="math">y</span>.
Then <span class="math">B</span> will say, &lsquo;Yes, when one disappeared the other was created&rsquo;.
But what happens to our friend in the other ship?
He says, &lsquo;No, you are wrong my friend.
I saw <span class="math">x</span> created before <span class="math">y</span>&rsquo;.
This is because he is moving towards <span class="math">x</span>, so the light from <span class="math">x</span> will have a shorter distance to travel than the light from <span class="math">y</span>, since he is moving away from <span class="math">y</span>.
He could say, &lsquo;No, <span class="math">x</span> was created first and then <span class="math">y</span> disappeared, so for a short time after <span class="math">x</span> was created and before <span class="math">y</span> disappeared I got some charge.
That is not the conservation of charge.
It is against the law&rsquo;.
But the first fellow says, &lsquo;Yes, but you are moving&rsquo;.
Then he says, &lsquo;How do you know?
I think you arc moving&rsquo;, and so on.
If we are unable, by any experiment, to see a difference in the physical laws whether we are moving or not, then if the conservation of charge were not local only a certain kind of man would see it work right, namely the guy who is standing still, in an absolute sense.
But such a thing is impossible according to Einstein&#39;s relativity principle, and therefore it is impossible to have non-local conservation of charge.
The locality of the conservation of charge is consonant with the theory of relativity, and it turns out that this is true of all the conservation laws.
You can appreciate that if anything is conserved the same principle applies.

There is another interesting thing about charge, a very strange thing for which we have no real explanation today.
It has nothing to do with the conservation law and is independent of it.
Charge always comes in units. When we have a charged particle it has one charge or two charges, or minus one or minus two.
Returning to our table, although this has nothing to do with the conservation of charge, I must write down that the thing that is conserved comes in units.
It is very nice that it comes in units, because that makes the theory of conservation of charge very easy to understand.
It is just a thing we can count, which goes from place to place.
Finally it turns out technically that the total charge of a thing is easy to determine electrically because the charge has a very important characteristic; it is the source of the electric and magnetic field.
Charge is a measure of the interaction of an object with electricity, with an electric field.
So another item which we should add to the list is that charge is the source of a field; in other words, electricity is related to charge.
Thus the particular quantity which is conserved here has two other aspects which are not connected with the conservation directly, but are interesting anyway.
One is that it comes in units, and the other that it is the source of a field.

There are many conservation laws, and I will give some more examples of laws of the same type as the conservation of charge, in the sense that it is merely a matter of counting.
There is a conservation law called the conservation of baryons.
A neutron can go into a proton.
If we count each of these as one unit, or baryon, then we do not lose the number of baryons.
The neutron carries one baryonic charge unit, or represents one baryon, a proton represents one baryon&mdash;all we are doing is counting and making big words!&mdash;so if the reaction I am speaking of occurs, in
which a neutron decays into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino, the total number of baryons does not change.
However there are other reactions in nature.
A proton plus a proton can produce a great variety of strange objects, for example a lambda, a proton and a K plus.
Lambda and K plus are names for peculiar particles.

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="\text{(easy)} P+P \rightarrow \lambda + P + K^+" display="block">

</math>


In this reaction we know we put two baryons in, but we see only one come out, so possibly either lambda or K<sup>+</sup> has a baryon.
If we study the lambda later we discover that very slowly it disintegrates into a proton and a pi, and ultimately the pi disintegrates into electrons and what-not.

\begin{equation}
    \text{(slow)} \lambda \rightarrow P + \pi
\end{equation}

</math>

What we have here is the baryon coming out again in the proton, so we think the lambda has a baryon number of 1, but the K+ does not, the K+ has zero.

On our chart of conservation laws ([fig. 14](#fig14)), then, we have charge and now we have a similar situation with baryons, with a special rule that the baryon number is the number of protons, plus the number of neutrons, plus the number of lambdas, minus the number of anti-protons, minus the number of anti-neutrons, and so on; it is just a counting proposition.
It is conserved, it comes in units, and nobody knows but everybody wants to think, by analogy, that it is the source of a field.
The reason we make these tables is that we are trying to guess at the laws of nuclear interaction, and this is one of the quick ways of guessing at nature.
If charge is the source of a field, and baryon does the same things in other respects it ought to be the source of a field too.
Too bad that so far it does not seem to be, it is possible, but we do not know enough to be sure.


There are one or two more of these counting propositions, for example Lepton numbers, and so on, but the idea is the same as with baryons.
There is one, however, which is slightly different.
There are in nature among these strange particles characteristic rates of reaction, some of which are very fast and easy, and others which are very slow and hard.
I do not mean easy and hard in a technical sense, in actually doing the experiment.
It concerns the rates at which the reactions occur when the particles are present.
There is a clear distinction between the two kinds of reaction which I have mentioned above, the decay of a pair of protons, and the much slower decay of the lambda.
It turns out that if you take only the fast and easy reactions there is one more counting law, in which the lambda gets a minus 1, and the K plus gets a plus 1, and the proton gets zero.
This is called the strangeness number, or hyperon charge, and it appears that the rule that it is conserved is right for every easy reaction, but wrong for the slow reactions.
On our chart ([fig. 14](#fig14)) we must therefore add the conservation law called the conservation of strangeness, or the conservation of hyperon number, which is nearly right.
This is very peculiar; we see why this quantity has been called strangeness.
It is nearly true that it is conserved, and true that it comes in units.
In trying to understand the strong interactions which are involved in nuclear forces, the fact that in strong interactions the thing is conserved has made people propose that for strong interactions it is also the source of a field, but again we do not know.
I bring these matters up to show you how conservation laws can be used to guess new laws.


There are other conservation laws that have been proposed from time to time, of the same nature as counting.
For example, chemists once thought that no matter what happened the number of sodium atoms stayed the same.
But sodium atoms are not permanent.
It is possible to transmute atoms from one element to another so that the original element has completely disappeared.
Another law which was for a while believed to be true was that the total mass of an object stays the same.
This depends on how you define mass, and whether you get mixed up with energy.
The mass conservation law is contained in the next one which I am going to discuss, the law of conservation of energy.
Of all the conservation laws, that dealing with energy is the most difficult and abstract, and yet the most useful.
It is more difficult to understand than those I have described so far, because in the case of charge, and the others, the mechanism is clear, it is more or less the conservation of objects.
This is not absolutely the case, because of the problem that we get new things from old things, but it is really a matter of simply counting.


The conservation of energy is a little more difficult, because this time we have a number which is not changed in time, but this number does not represent any particular thing.
I would like to make a kind of silly analogy to explain a little about it.


I want you to imagine that a mother has a child whom she leaves alone in a room with 28 absolutely indestructible blocks.
The child plays with the blocks all day, and when the mother comes back she discovers that there are indeed 28 blocks; she checks all the time the conservation of blocks!
This goes on for a few days, and then one day when she comes in there are only 27 blocks.
However, she finds one block lying outside the window, the child had thrown it out.
The first thing you must appreciate about conservation laws is that you must watch that the stuff you are trying to check does not go out through the wall.
The same thing could happen the other way, if a boy came in to play with the child, bringing some blocks with him.
Obviously these are matters you have to consider when you talk about conservation laws.
Suppose one day when the mother comes to count the blocks she finds that there are only 25 blocks, but suspects that the child has hidden the other three blocks in a little toy box.
So she says, &lsquo;I am going to open the box&rsquo;.
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you cannot open the box.&rsquo;
Being a very clever mother she would say, &lsquo;I know that when the box is empty it weighs 16 ounces, and each block weighs 3 ounces, so what I am going to do is to weigh the box&rsquo;.
So, totalling up the number of blocks, she would get&mdash;

%% TODO
\begin{equation}
    \text{No. of blocks seen} + \frac{\text{Weight of box 16 oz}}{\text{3 oz}}
\end{equation}
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" alttext="\text{No. of blocks seen} + \frac{\text{Weight of box 16 oz}}{\text{3 oz}}" display="block">

and that adds up to 28.
This works all right for a while, and then one day the sum does not check up properly.
However, she notices that the dirty water in the sink is changing its level.
She knows that the water is 6 inches deep when there is no block in it, and that it would rise 1/4 inch if a block was in the water, so she adds another term, and now she has&mdash;

and once again it adds up to 28.
As the boy becomes more ingenious, and the mother continues to be equally ingenious, more and more terms must be added, all of which represent blocks, but from the mathematical standpoint are abstract calculations, because the blocks are not seen.

Now I would like to draw my analogy, and tell you what is common between this and the conservation of energy, and what is different.
First suppose that in all of the situations you never saw any blocks.
The term &lsquo;&#8470;<!--Text Numero--> of blocks seen&rsquo; is never included.
Then the mother would always be calculating a whole lot of terms like &lsquo;blocks in the box&rsquo;, &lsquo;blocks in the water&rsquo;, and so on.
With energy there is this difference, that there are no blocks, so far as we can tell.
Also, unlike the case of the blocks, for energy the numbers that come out are not integers.
I suppose it might happen to the poor mother that when she calculates one term it comes out 6&#8539;<!--vulgar 1/8--> blocks, and when she calculates another it comes out &#8542;<!-- vulgar 7/8--> of a block, and the others give 21, which still totals 28.
That is how it looks with energy.


What we have discovered about energy is that we have a scheme with a sequence of rules.
From each different set of rules we can calculate a number for each different kind of energy.
When we add all the numbers together, from all the different forms of energy, it always gives the same total.
But as far as we know there are no real units, no little ballbearings.
It is abstract, purely mathematical, that there is a number such that whenever you calculate it it does not change. I cannot interpret it any better than that.


This energy has all kinds of forms, analogous to the blocks in the box, blocks in the water, and so on.
There is energy due to motion called kinetic energy, energy due to gravitational interaction (gravitational potential energy, it is called), thermal energy, electrical energy, light energy, elastic energy in springs and so on, chemical energy, nuclear energy&mdash;and there is also an energy that a particle has from its mere existence, an energy that depends directly on its mass.
The last is the contribution of Einstein, as you undoubtedly know.
<span class="math">E=mc<sup>2</sub></span> is the famous equation of the law I am talking about.


Although I have mentioned a large number of energies, I would like to explain that we are not completely ignorant about this, and we do understand the relationship of some of them to others.
For instance, what we call thermal energy is to a large extent merely the kinetic energy of the motion of the particles inside an object.
Elastic energy and chemical energy both have the same origin, namely the forces between the atoms.
When the atoms rearrange themselves in a new pattern some energy is changed, and if that quantity changes it means that some other quantity also has to change.
For example, if you are burning something the chemical energy changes, and you find heat where you did not have heat before, because it all has to add up right.
Elastic energy and chemical energy are both interactions of atoms, and we now understand these interactions to be a combination of two things, one electrical energy and the other kinetic energy again, only this time the formula for it is quantum mechanical.
Light energy is nothing but electrical energy, because light has now been interpreted as an electric and magnetic wave. Nuclear energy is not represented in terms of the others; at the moment I cannot say more than that it is the result of nuclear forces.
I am not just talking here about the energy released.
In the uranium nucleus there is a certain amount of energy, and when the thing disintegrates the amount of energy remaining in the nucleus changes, but the total amount of energy in the world does not change, so a lot of heat and stuff is generated in the process, in order to balance up.


This conservation law is very useful in many technical ways.
I will give you some very simple examples to show how, knowing the law of conservation of energy and the formulae for calculating energy, we can understand other laws.
In other words many other laws are not independent, but are simply secret ways of talking about the conservation of energy.
The simplest is the law of the lever (fig. \ref{fig:16}).

<figure id="fig16">
</figure>

We have a lever on a pivot.
The length of one arm is 1 foot and the other 4 feet.
First I must give the law for gravity energy, which is that if you have a number of weights, you take the weight of each and multiply it by its height above the ground, add this together for all the weights, and that gives the total of gravity energy.
Suppose I have a 2 pound weight on the long arm, and an unknown mystic weight on the other side&mdash;<span class="math">X</span> is always the unknown, so let us call it <span class="math">W</span> to make it seem that we have advanced above the usual!
Now the question is, how much must <span class="math">W</span> be so that it just balances and swings quietly back and forth without any trouble?
If it swings quietly back and forth, that means that the energy is the same whether the balance is parallel to the ground or tilted so that the 2 lb weight is, say, 1 inch above the ground.
If the energy is the same then it does not care much which way, and it does not fall over.
If the 2 lb weight goes up 1 inch how far down does <span class="math">W</span> go?
From the diagram you can see (fig. \ref{fig:3}) that if <span class="math">AO</span> is 1 foot and <span class="math">OB</span> is 4 feet, then when <span class="math">BB<sup>&#8242;<!--prime--></sup></span> is 1 inch <span class="math">AA<sup>&#8242;<!--prime--></sup></span> will be 1 inch.
Now apply the law for gravity energy. 
Before anything happened all the heights were zero, so the total energy was zero. 
After the move has happened to get the gravity energy we multiply the weight 2 lb by the height 1 inch and add it to the unknown weight <span class="math">W</span> times the height&mdash;&frac14; inch.
The sum of this must give the same energy as before&mdash;zero.
So&mdash;

This is one way we can understand the easy law, which you already knew of course, the law of the lever.
But it is interesting that not only this but hundreds of other physical laws can be closely related to various forms of energy.
I showed you this example only to illustrate how useful it is.

The only trouble is, of course, that in practice it does not really work because of friction in the fulcrum.
If I have something moving, for example a ball rolling along at a constant height, then it will stop on account of friction.
What happened to the kinetic energy of the ball?
The answer is that the energy of the motion of the ball has gone into the energy of the jiggling of the atoms in the floor and in the ball.
The world that we see on a large scale looks like a nice round ball when we polish it, but it is really quite complicated when looked at on a little scale; billions of tiny atoms,
with all kinds of irregular shapes. It is like a very rough boulder when looked at finely enough, because it is made out of these little balls.
The floor is the same, a bumpy business made out of balls.
When you roll this monster boulder over the magnified floor you can see that the little atoms are going to go snap-jiggle, snap-jiggle.
After the thing has rolled across, the ones that are left behind are still shaking a little from the pushing and snapping that they went through; so there is left in the floor a jiggling motion, or thermal energy.
At first it appears as if the law of conservation is false, but energy has the tendency to hide from us and we need thermometers and other instruments to make sure that it is still there. We find that energy is conserved no matter how complex the process, even when we do not know the detailed laws.

The first demonstration of the law of conservation of energy was not by a physicist but by a medical man.
He demonstrated with rats.
If you burn food you can find out how much heat is generated.
If you then feed the same amount of food to rats it is converted, with oxygen, into carbon dioxide, in the same way as in burning.
When you measure the energy in each case you find out that living creatures do exactly the same as non-live creatures.
The law for conservation of energy is as true for fife as for other phenomena.
Incidentally, it is interesting that every law or principle that we know for &lsquo;dead&rsquo; things, and that we can test on the great phenomenon of life, works just as well there.
There is no evidence yet that what goes on in living creatures is necessarily different, so far as the physical laws are concerned, from what goes on in non-living things, although the living things may be much more complicated.
The amount of energy in food, which will tell you how much heat, mechanical work, etc., it can generate, is measured in calories.
When you hear of calories you are not eating something called calories, that is simply the measure of the amount of heat energy that is in the food.
Physicists sometimes feel so superior and smart that other people would like to catch them out once on something.
I will give you something to get them on.
They should be utterly ashamed of the way they take energy and measure it in a host of different ways, with different names.
It is absurd that energy can be measured in calories, in ergs, in electron volts, in foot pounds, in B.T.U.s, in horsepower hours, in kilowatt hours&mdash;all measuring exactly the same thing.
It is like having money in dollars, pounds, and so on; but unlike the economic situation where the ratio can change, these dopey things are in absolutely guaranteed proportion.
If anything is analogous, it is like shillings and pounds&mdash;there are always 20 shillings to a pound.
But one complication that the physicist allows is that instead of having a number like 20 he has irrational ratios like 1-6183178 shillings to a pound.
You would think that at least the more modern high-class theoretical physicists would use a common unit, but you find papers with degrees Kelvin for measuring energy, megacycles, and now inverse Fermis, the latest invention.
For those who want some proof that physicists are human, the proof is in the idiocy of all the different units which they use for measuring energy.


There are a number of interesting phenomena in nature which present us with curious problems concerning energy.
There has been a recent discovery of things called quasars, which are enormously far away, and they radiate so much energy in the form of light and radio waves that the question is where does it come from?
If the conservation of energy is right, the condition of the quasar after it has radiated this enormous amount of energy must be different from its condition before.
The question is, is it coming from gravitation energy&mdash;is the thing collapsed gravitationally, in a different condition gravitationally? Or is this big emission coming from nuclear energy?
Nobody knows.
You might propose that perhaps the law of conservation of energy is not right.
Well, when a thing is investigated as incompletely as the quasar&mdash;quasars are so distant that the astronomers cannot see them too easily&mdash;then if such a thing seems to conflict with the fundamental laws, it very rarely is that the fundamental laws are wrong, it usually is just that the details are unknown.


Another interesting example of the use of the law of conservation of energy is in the reaction when a neutron disintegrates into a proton, an electron, and an anti-neutrino.
It was first thought that a neutron turned into a proton plus an electron.
But the energy of all the particles could be measured, and a proton and an electron together did not add up to a neutron.
Two possibilities existed.
It might have been that the law of energy conservation was not right; in fact it was proposed by Bohr [^2] for a while that perhaps the conservation law worked only statistically, on the average.
But it turns out now that the other possibility is the correct one, that the fact that the energy does not check out is because there is something else coming out, something which we now call an anti-neutrino.
The anti-neutrino which comes out takes up the energy.
You might say that the only reason for the anti-neutrino is to make the conservation of energy right.
But it makes a lot of other things right, like the conservation of momentum and other conservation laws, and very recently it has been directly demonstrated that such neutrinos do indeed exist.


This example illustrates a point.
How is it possible that we can extend our laws into regions we are not sure about?
Why are we so confident that, because we have checked the energy conservation here, when we get a new phenomenon we can say it has to satisfy the law of conservation of energy?
Every once in a while you read in the paper that physicists have discovered that one of their favourite laws is wrong.
Is it then a mistake to say that a law is true in a region where you have not yet looked?
If you will never say that a law is true in a region where you have not already looked you do not know anything.
If the only laws that you find are those which you have just finished observing then you can never make any predictions.
Yet the only utility of science is to go on and to try to make guesses.
So what we always do is to stick our necks out, and in the case of energy the most likely thing is that it is conserved in other places.


Of course this means that science is uncertain; the moment that you make a proposition about a region of experience that you have not directly seen then you must be uncertain.
But we always must make statements about the regions that we have not seen, or the whole business is no use.
For instance, the mass of an object changes when it moves, because of the conservation of energy.
Because of the relation of mass and energy the energy associated with the motion appears as an extra mass, so things get heavier when they move.
Newton believed that this was not the case, and that the masses stayed constant.
When it was discovered that the Newtonian idea was false everyone kept saying what a terrible thing it was that physicists had found out that they were wrong.
Why did they think they were right?
The effect is very small, and only shows when you get near the speed of light.
If you spin a top it weighs the same as if you do not spin it, to within a very very fine fraction.
Should they then have said, &lsquo;If you do not move any faster than so-and-so, then the mass does not change&rsquo;?
That would then be certain.
No, because if the experiment happened to have been done only with tops of wood, copper and steel, they would have had to say &lsquo;Tops made out of copper, wood and steel, when not moving any faster than so and so &hellip;&rsquo;.
You see, we do not know all the conditions that we need for an experiment.
It is not known whether a radioactive top would have a mass that is conserved.
So we have to make guesses in order to give any utility at all to science.
In order to avoid simply describing experiments that have been done, we have to propose laws beyond their observed range.
There is nothing wrong with that, despite the fact that it makes science uncertain.
If you thought before that science was certain&mdash;well, that is just an error on your part.


To return then, to our list of conservation laws (fig. 14), we can add energy.
It is conserved perfectly, as far as we know.
It does not come in units.
Now the question is, is it the source of a field?
The answer is yes.
Einstein understood gravitation as being generated by energy.
Energy and mass are equivalent, and so Newton&#39;s interpretation that the mass is what produces gravity has been modified to the statement that the energy produces the gravity.


There are other laws similar to the conservation of energy, in the sense that they are numbers.
One of them is momentum.
If you take all the masses of an object, multiply them by the velocities, and add them all together, the sum is the momentum of the particles; and the total amount of momentum is conserved.
Energy and momentum are now understood to be very closely related, so I have put them in the same column of our table.


Another example of a conserved quantity is angular momentum, an item which we discussed before.
The angular momentum is the area generated per second by objects moving about.
For example, if we have a moving object, and we take any centre whatsoever, then the speed at which the area (fig. 17) swept out by a line from centre to object,

<figure id="fig17">
</figure>

increases, multiplied by the mass of the object, and added together for all the objects, is called the angular momentum.
And that quantity does not change.
So we have conservation of angular momentum.
Incidentally, at first sight, if you know too much physics, you might think that the angular momentum is not conserved.
Like the energy it appears in different forms.
Although most people think it only appears in motion it does appear in other forms, as I will illustrate.
If you have a wire, and move a magnet up into it, increasing the magnetic field through the flux through the wire, there will be an electric current&mdash;that is how electric generators work.
Imagine that instead of a wire I have a disc, on which there are electric charges analogous to the electrons in the wire (fig. \ref{fig:18}).
Now I bring a magnet dead centre along the

<figure id="fig18">
</figure>

axis from far away, very rapidly up to the disc, so that now there is a flux change.
Then, just as in the wire, the charges will start to go around, and if the disc were on a wheel it would be spinning by the time I had brought the magnet up.
That does not look like conservation of angular momentum, because when the magnet is away from the disc nothing is turning, and when they are close together it is spinning.
We have got turning for nothing, and that is against the rules.
&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;I know, there must be some other kind of interaction that makes the magnet spin the opposite way.&rsquo;
That is not the case.
There is no electrical force on the magnet tending to twist it the opposite way.
The explanation is that angular momentum appears in two forms: one of them is angular momentum of motion, and the other is angular momentum in electric and magnetic fields.
There is angular momentum in the field around the magnet, although it does not appear as motion, and this has the opposite sign to the spin. If we take the opposite case it is even clearer

<figure id="fig19">
</figure>

If we have just the particles, and the magnet, close together, and everything is standing still, I say there is angular momentum in the field, a hidden form of angular momentum which does not appear as actual rotation.
When you pull the magnet down and take the instrument apart, then all the fields separate and the angular momentum now has to appear and the disc will start to spin.
The law that makes it spin is the law of induction of electricity.


Whether angular momentum comes in units is very difficult for me to answer.
At first sight it appears that it is absolutely impossible that angular momentum comes in units, because angular momentum depends upon the direction at which you project the picture.
You are looking at an area change, and obviously this will be different depending on whether it is looked at from an angle, or straight on.
If angular momentum came in units, and say you looked at something and it showed 8 units, then if you looked at it from a very slightly different angle, the number of units would be very slightly different, perhaps a tiny bit less than 8.
But 7 is not a little bit less than 8; it is a definite amount less than eight. So it cannot possibly come in units.
However this proof is evaded by the subtleties and peculiarities of quantum mechanics, and if we measure the angular momentum about any axis, amazingly enough it is always a number of units.
It is not the kind of unit, like an electric charge, that you can count.
The angular momentum does come in units in the mathematical sense that the number we get in any measurement is a definite integer times a unit.
But we cannot interpret this in the same way as with units of electric charge, imaginable units that we can count&mdash;one, then another, then another.
In the case of angular momentum we cannot imagine them as separate units, but it comes out always as an integer &hellip; which is very peculiar.

There are other conservation laws.
They are not as interesting as those I have described, and do not deal exactly


<figure id="fig20">
</figure>


with the conservation of numbers.
Suppose we had some kind of device with particles moving with a certain definite symmetry, and suppose their movements were bilaterally symmetrical (fig. \ref{fig:20}).
Then, following the laws of physics, with all the movements and collisions, you could expect, and rightly, that if you look at the same picture later on it will still be bilaterally symmetrical.
So there is a kind of conservation, the conservation of the symmetry character.
This should be in the table, but it is not like a number that you measure, and we will discuss it in much more detail in the next lecture.
The reason this is not very interesting in classical physics is because the times when there are such nicely symmetrical initial conditions are very rare, and it is therefore a not very important or practical conservation law.
But in quantum mechanics, when we deal with very simple systems like atoms, their internal constitution often has a kind of symmetry, like bilateral symmetry, and then the symmetry character is maintained.
This is therefore an important law for understanding quantum phenomena.


One interesting question is whether there is a deeper basis for these conservation laws, or whether we have to take them as they are.
I will discuss that question in the next lecture, but there is one point I should like to make now.
In discussing these ideas on a popular level, there seem to be a lot of unrelated concepts; but with a more profound understanding of the various principles there appear deep interconnections between the concepts, each one implying others in some way.
One example is the relation between relativity and the necessity for local conservation.
If I had stated this without a demonstration, it might appear to be some kind of miracle that if you cannot tell how fast you are moving this implies that if something is conserved it must be done not by jumping from one place to another.
At this point I would like to indicate how the conservation of angular momentum, the conservation of momentum, and a few other things are to some extent related.
The conservation of angular momentum has to do with the area swept by particles moving.
If you have a lot of particles (fig. \ref{fig:21}), and take your centre (<span class="math">x</span>) very far away, then the distances are almost the same for every object.
In this case the only thing that counts in the area sweeping, or in the conservation of angular momentum, is the component of motion, which in figure 21 is vertical.
What we discover then

<figure id="fig21">
</figure>


is that the total of the masses, each multiplied by its velocity vertically, must be a constant, because the angular momentum is a constant about any point, and if the chosen point is far enough away only the masses and velocities are relevant.
In this way the conservation of angular momentum implies the conservation of momentum.
This in turn implies something else, the conservation of another item which is so closely connected that I did not bother to put it in the table.
This is a principle about the centre of gravity (fig. \ref{fig:22}).

<figure id="fig22">
</figure>

A mass, in a box, cannot just disappear from one position and move over to another position all by itself.
That is nothing to do with conservation of the mass; you still have the mass, just moved from one place to another.
Charge could do this, but not a mass.
Let me explain why.
The laws of physics are not affected by motion, so we can suppose that this box is drifting slowly upwards.
Now we take the angular momentum from a point not far away, <span class="math">x</span>.
As the box is drifting upwards, if the mass is lying quiet in the box, at position 1, it will be producing an area at a given rate.
After the mass has moved over to position 2, the area will be increasing at a greater rate, because although the altitude will be the same because the box is still drifting upwards, the distance from <span class="math">x</span> to the mass has increased.
By the conservation of angular momentum you cannot change the rate at which the area is changing, and therefore you simply cannot move one mass from one place to another unless you push on something else to balance up the angular momentum.
That is the reason why rockets in empty space cannot go &hellip; but they do go.
If you figure it out with a lot of masses, then if you move one forward you must move others back, so that the total motion back and forward of all the masses is nothing.
This is how a rocket works.
At first it is standing still, say, in empty space, and then it shoots some gas out of the back, and the rocket goes forward.
The point is that of all the stuff in the world, the centre of mass, the average of all the mass, is still right where it was before.
The interesting part has moved on, and an uninteresting part that we do not care about has moved back.
There is no theorem that says that the interesting things in the world are conserved&mdash;only the total of everything.


Discovering the laws of physics is like trying to put together the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
We have all these different pieces, and today they are proliferating rapidly.
Many of them are lying about and cannot be fitted with the other ones.
How do we know that they belong together?
How do we know that they are really all part of one as yet incomplete picture?
We are not sure, and it worries us to some extent, but we get encouragement from the common characteristics of several pieces.
They all show blue sky, or they are all made out of the same kind of wood.
All the various physical laws obey the same conservation principles.
