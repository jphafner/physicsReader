This chapter and those that follow deal with time.
In particular, this chapter looks at the direction of time.
Why does time go one way only?
Why cannot we turn time backwards?
Why are we not able to travel in time, back and forth?

The idea of time travel has fascinated men.
Even folklore contains legends about travel in time.
And science fiction, from The Time Machine onwards, has been pre-occupied with this theme.
Plainly, men feel themselves to be imprisoned in the single direction of time.
They would like to move about in time as freely as they can move in space.


And time is in some way like space.
Like space, time is not a thing but is a relation between things.
The essence of space is that it describes an order among things&emdash;higher or lower, in front or behind, to left or to right.
The essence of time also is that it describes an order&emdash;earlier or later.
Yet we cannot move things in time as we can in space.
Time must therefore describe some fundamental process in nature which we do not control.


It is not easy to discuss time without bringing in some way of measuring it&emdash;a clock of one sort or another.
Yet if all the clocks in the world stopped, and if we all lost all inner sense of time, we could still tell earlier from later.
The essential nature of time does not depend on clocks.
That is the point of this chapter, and we will begin by illustrating it from very simple and common experiences.


The three pairs of pictures point the way.
They help to show what it is that enables us to tell earlier from later without a clock.
In each pair, the pictures are arranged at random, and not necessarily in the sequence of time.
Yet in all except the first pair, it is easy to arrange the pictures; the sequence in time is obvious.
Only the first pair does not betray its time sequence.
What is the difference between the first pair of pictures and the other two pairs?


We get a clue to the difference when we study the arrangement of the things in each picture.
In the first pair, we cannot really distinguish one arrangement from another; they are equally tidy and orderly.
The two pictures of the first pair show a shot at billiards.
The billiard balls are as well arranged after the shot as before; there is no obvious difference between the arrangements.


The situation is different in the other two pairs.
A broken egg is an entirely different arrangement from a whole egg.
A snooker pyramid is quite different from a jumble of balls.

And not only are the arrangements here different.
Once they are different, it is quite clear which arrangement comes before the other.
Whole eggs come before broken ones.
The snooker pyramid comes before the spread of the balls.


In each case, the earlier arrangement is more ordered than the later.
Time produces disorder; that is the lesson of these pictures.
And it is also the lesson of this chapter.
The arrow of time is loss of order.


In a game of snooker, we know quite well that the highly ordered arrangement of the balls at the beginning of the game comes before the disordered arrangement at the end of the first shot.
Indeed, the first shot is called `breaking the pyramid&#39;: and breaking is a destructive action&emdash;it destroys order.
It is just not conceivable that fifteen balls would gather themselves up into a pyramid, however skillful the player.
The universe does not suddenly create order out of disorder.


These pictures show the same thing again.
When a spot of powdered dye is put on the surface of water, it spreads out and gradually dissolves.
Dye would never come out of solution and stream together by itself to gather in a spot on the surface.
Again time is breaking down order and making disorder.
It disperses the dye randomly through the water.


We know at once that the stones in the picture below were shaped and erected a very long time ago.
Their rough, weathered surfaces bear the mark of time, it is still possible to reconstruct the once orderly arrangement of the stones of Stonehenge.
But the once orderly surface of each stone cannot be recovered.
Atom by atom, the smooth surface has been carried away, and is lost to chaos.


And here finally is the most interesting of all the pictures in which time betrays itself.
In these shots from an old film the heroine has been tied to the rails&emdash;a splendid tradition of silent films.
A train is approaching, but of course it stops just in time.
The role of the heroine would seem to call for strong nerves as well as dramatic ability, if she has to trust the engine driver to stop the locomotive exactly where he is told.
However, the last few yards of the approach are in fact done by a trick.
The locomotive is started close to the heroine and is backed away; and the film is then run backwards.


There is only one thing that gives this trick away.
When the film is run backwards, the smoke visibly goes into the funnel instead of coming out of it.
We know that in reality, smoke behaves like the spreading dye: it becomes more disorderly, the further it gets from the funnel.
So when we see disorder coming before order, we realise that something is wrong.
Smoke does not of itself collect together and stream down a funnel.


One thing remains to clear up in these examples.
We began with an example in which earlier and later were equally well ordered.
The example was a shot at billiards.
The planets in their orbits would be another example, in which there would be nothing to say which arrangement comes first.


Then does time stand still in billiards and planetary motion?
No, time is still doing its work of disorder.
We may not see the effects at once, but they are there.
For billiard balls and planets gradually lose material from their surface, just like the stones of Stonehenge. Time destroys their orderly shape too.
A billiard ball is not quite the same after a shot as before it.
A planet is not quite the same in each successive orbit.
And the changes are in the direction of disorder.
Atoms are lost from ordered structures and return to chaos.
The direction of time is from order to disorder.



That is one reason why perpetual motion machines are impossible.
Time cannot be brought to a standstill.
We cannot freeze the arrangement of the atoms, even in a tiny corner of the universe.
And that is what we should have to do to make a perpetual motion machine.
The machine would have to remain the same, atom for atom, for all time.
Time would have to stand still for it.


For example, take the first of these three machines from a famous book of Perpetual Motion Machines.
It is meant to be kept going by balls in each sector, which roll from the centre to the rim and back again as the wheel turns.
Of course it does not work.
There is friction in the bearing of the wheel, and more friction between the balls and the tracks they run on.
Every movement rubs off a few atoms.
The bearings wear, the balls lose their smooth roundness.
Time does not stand still.


The second machine is more complicated and sillier.
It is designed to work like a waterwheel with little balls instead of water.
At the bottom the balls roll out of their compartments down the chute, and on to a moving belt which is to lift them to the top again.
That is how the machine is meant to keep going.
In fact, when we built it, it came to a stop every few minutes.


The pendulum arrangement in the third picture also comes from the book of Perpetual Motion Machines.
A bail runs backwards and forwards in the trough on top to keep it going.
There are also elastic strings at each end for good measure.
This machine at least works for short bursts.
But as a perpetual motion machine, it has the same defects as the others.
Nothing can be done to get rid of friction; and where there is friction, there must be wear.


This last point is usually put a little differently.
Every machine has friction.
It has to be supplied with energy to overcome the friction.
And this energy cannot be recovered.
In fact, this energy is lost in heat, and in wear&emdash;that is, in moving atoms out of their order, and in losing them.
That is another way of putting the same reasoning, and shows equally (in different language) why a perpetual motion machine cannot work.


Before we put these fanciful monsters out of mind, it is worth seeing how beautifully a fine machine can be made.
It cannot conquer the disorder of time, it cannot get rid of friction, but it can keep them to a minimum.
So on page 132 are two splendid clocks which make no pretence to do the impossible, yet which go as far as it is possible to go by means of exact and intelligent craftsmanship.


These clocks are not intended to be perpetual motion machines.
Each has an outside source of energy to keep it going.
In the clock at the top, it is ordinary clockwork which tips the platform whenever the ball has completed a run.
The clock below is more tricky: it has no clockwork spring, and instead is driven by temperature differences in the air.
But even if there was someone to wind one clock, and suitable air conditions for the other, they could not run for ever.
They would wear out.
That is, their ordered structure would slowly become more disordered until they stopped.
The clock with no spring would run for several hundred years, but it could not run for ever.


To summarise: the direction of time in the universe is marked by increasing disorder.
Even without clocks and without an inner sense of time, we could tell later and earlier.
Later is characterised by the greater disorder, by the growing randomness of the universe.


We ought to be clear what these descriptive phrases mean.
Order is a very special arrangement; and disorder means the loss of what makes it special.
When we say that the universe is becoming more disordered, more random, we mean that the special arrangements in this place or that are being evened out.
The peaks are made lower, the holes are filled in.
The extremes disappear, and all parts sink more and more towards a level average.
Disorder and randomness are not wild states; they are simply states which have no special arrangement, and in which everything is therefore near the average.


Even in disorder, of course, things move and deviate round their average.
But they deviate by chance, and chance then takes them back to the average.
It is only in exceptional cases that a deviation becomes fixed, and perpetuates itself.
These exceptions are fascinating and important, and we now turn to them.


The movement towards randomness, we repeat, is not uniform.
It is statistical, a general trend.
And (as we saw in Chapter 8) the units that make up a general trend do not all flow in the same direction.
Here and there, in the midst of the flow towards an average of chaos, there are places where the flow is reversed for a time.
The most remarkable of these reversals is life.
Life as it were is running against time.
Life is the very opposite of randomness.


How this can come about can be shown by an analogy.
The flow of time is like an endless shuffling of a pack of cards.
A typical hand dealt after long shuffling will be random&emdash;say four diamonds, a couple of spades, four clubs, and three hearts.
This is the sort of hand a bridge player expects to pick up several times in an evening.
Yet every now and then a bridge player picks up a freak hand.
For example, from time to time a player picks up all thirteen spades.
And this does not mean that the pack was not properly shuffled.
A hand of thirteen spades can arise by chance, and does; the odds against it are high, but they are not astronomic.
Life started with a chance accident of this kind.
The odds against it were high, but they were not astronomic.


The special thing about life is that it is self perpetuating.
The freak hand, instead of disappearing in the next shuffle, reproduces itself.
Once the thirteen spades of life are dealt, they keep their order, and they impose it on the pack from then on.
This is what distinguishes life from other freaks, other deviations from the average.


There are other happenings in the universe that run against the flow of time for a while.
The formation of a star from the interstellar dust is such a happening.
When a star is formed, the dust that forms it becomes less random; its order is increased, not decreased.
But stars do not reproduce themselves.
Once the star is formed, the accident is over.
The flow towards disorder starts again.
The deviation begins to ebb back towards the average.


Life is a deviation of a special kind; it is a self reproducing accident.
Once its highly ordered arrangement occurs, once the thirteen spades happen to be dealt in one hand, it repeats itself.
The order was reached by chance, but it then survives because it is able to perpetuate itself, and to impose itself on other matter.


It is rare to find in dead matter behavior of this kind which illustrates the way in which life imposes its order.
An analogy of a kind, however, is found in the growth of crystals. When a supercooled solution is ready to form crystals, it needs something to start it off.
Now we introduce the outside accident, the freak hand at bridge.
That is, we introduce a tiny crystal that we have made, and we drop it in.
At once the crystal starts to grow and to impose its own shape round it.


In this analogy, the first crystal is a seed, like the seed of life.
Without it, the supercooled solution would remain dead, unchanged for hours or even days.
And like the seed of life, the first crystal imposes its order all round it.
It reproduces it.self many times over.


Nearly five hundred years ago, Leonardo da Vinci described time as the destroyer of all things.
So we have seen it in this chapter.
It is the nature of time to destroy things, to turn order into disorder.
This indeed gives time its single direction its arrow.


But the arrow of time is only statistical.
The general trend is towards an average chaos; yet there are deviations which move in the opposite direction.
Life is the most important deviation of this kind.
It is able to reproduce itself, and so to perpetuate the order which began by accident.
Life runs against the disorder of time.
