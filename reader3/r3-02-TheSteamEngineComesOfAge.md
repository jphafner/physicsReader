The steam engine, coke, iron, and steel are the four principal factors contributing to the acceleration of technology called the
Industrial Revolution, which some claim to have begun about 1750 but which did not really gain momentum until about 1830.
It started in Great Britain but the movement gradually spread to the Continent and to North America during the nineteenth century.

## Science Inspires The Engineer

During the Age of Projects the engineer had little help from the scientists, who were building the mathematical-mechanical picture of the Newtonian world and discussing the laws of nature.
However, during the eighteenth century, the Age of Reason, when the principles of this new science had been formulated, the scientists turned to the study of problems of detail many of which were of direct help to the engineer.
The latter was perhaps less interested in the new ideals of `progress&#39; and `citizenship of the world&#39; than in the new theory of heat, in applied mechanics and the strength of materials, or in new mathematical tools for their calculations.
The older universities like Oxford and Cambridge contributed little to this collaboration.
The pace was set by the younger ones such as the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, which produced such men as Hume, Roebuck, Kerr, and Black, who stimulated the new technology.
The Royal Society, and also new centres like the Lunar Society and the Manchester Philosophical Society and the many similar societies on the Continent, contributed much to this new technology by studying and discussing the latest scientific theories and the arts.
Here noblemen, bankers, and merchants met to hear the scientist, the inventor, and the engineer and to help to realize many of the projects which the latter put forward.
They devoted much money to scientific investigations, to demonstrations and stimulated inventions by offering prizes for practical solutions of burning problems.
They had the capital to promote the `progress&#39; which made Dr Johnson cry out: `This age is running mad after innovation.
All business of the world is to be done in a new way, men are to be hanged in a new way; Tyburn itself is not safe from the fury of innovation!&#39;
New institutions such as the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers and the Royal Institution of Great Britain were founded to spread the new science and technology by lectures and demonstrations and the number of laymen attending these lectures was overwhelming.

## Engineers and Skilled Labour

The new professional engineers which the ficole des Fonts et Chaussees began to turn out were the descendants of the sappers and military engineers.
However, the new technology also needed other types of engineers for which new schools such as the ficole Polytechnique and the ficole des Mines were founded.
In Great Britain the State was less concerned with the education of the new master craftsmen.
They were trained in practice: such famous workshops as that of Boulton and Watt in Soho, Birmingham, or those of Dobson and Barlow, Asa Lees, and Richard Roberts.
Their success depended not only on good instruction but also on appropriate instruments and skilled labour.


The scientists of the eighteenth century had turned out many new instruments which were of great value to the engineer.
They were no longer made individually by the research scientist, but by professional instrument makers in Cassel, Nuremberg, or London, and such university towns as Leiden, Paris, and Edinburgh.
Their instruments became more efficient and precise as better materials became available such as good glass for lenses and more accurate methods for working metals.


Skilled labour was more difficult to create.
The older generation of Boulton and Watt had to work with craftsmen such as smiths and carpenters, they had to re-educate them and create a new type of craftsmen, `skilled labour&#39;.
The design of early machinery often reveals that it was built by the older type of craftsmen that belonged to the last days of the guild system.
The new industrialists tried out several systems of apprenticeship in their machine shops during the eighteenth century until they finally solved this educational problem during the next century and created schools and courses for workmen for the new industries, qualified to design and to make well-specified engines and machine parts.


A factor that contributed greatly to this development was the rise of the science of applied mechanics and the methods of testing materials.
The theories and laws which such men as Palladio, Derand, Hooke, Bernoulli, Euler, Coulomb, and Perronet formulated may have been imperfect but they showed the way to estimate the strength of materials so important in the construction of machinery.
&#39;s Gravesande and Van Musschenbroek were the first to design and demonstrate various machines for measuring tensile, breaking, and bending strengths of various materials early in the eighteenth century.
Such instruments were gradually improved by Gauthey, Rondelet, and others.
The elastic behaviour&#39;s of beams, the strength of arches, and many other problems depended on such tests.
Some scientists developed tests for certain types of materials, for instance for timber (Buffon), stone (Gauthey), or metals (Reaumur).
Such knowledge was of prime importance to the development of the steam engine and other machinery which came from the machine shops.

## Machine Shops

The engineers who led this Industrial Revolution had to create both the tools and the new workmen.
Watt, himself a trained instrument maker, had to invent several new tools and machines and to train his workmen in foundries and machine shops.
Hence his notebooks are full of new ideas and machines.
He invented the copying press.
His ingenious contemporaries Maudsley and Bramah were equally productive.
Joseph Bramah was responsible for our modern water closet (1778) and the first successful patent lock (1784) which no one succeeded in opening with a skeleton key before Hobbs (1851), who spent fifty-one hours of labour on it.


The difficulty in finding suitable labour arose from the fact that the new machines were no longer single pieces created by one smith, but that series of such machines were built from standard parts which demanded much greater precision in manufacturing such parts.
The steam engine parts had to be finished accurately to prevent the steam escaping between metal surfaces which slid over each other, especially as steam pressures were gradually increased to make these machines more efficient.
Hence the importance of the new tools and finishing processes, such as the lathe and drilling, cutting and finishing machinery.


In 1797 Henry Maudsley invented the screw-cutting lathe.
Lathes originally belonged to the carpenter&#39;s shop.
Even before the eighteenth century they had been used to turn soft metals such as tin and lead.
These lathes were now moved by means of treadles instead of a bow, though Leonardo da Vinci had already designed lathes with interchangeable sets of gear wheels to regulate the speed of the lathe.
Maudsley applied similar ideas and introduced the slide rest.
Brunei, Roberts, Fox, Witworth, and others perfected the modem lathe, which permitted moving the object horizontally and vertically, adjustment by screws, and automatic switching off when the operation was completed.
The older machine lathes were first moved by hand, then by a steam engine, and finally by electric motors.
Now the mass production of screws, bolts, nuts, and other standard parts became possible and machines were no longer separate pieces of work.
They were assembled from mass-produced parts.


The tools of the machine shop were greatly improved during the nineteenth century, pulleys, axles, and handles being perfected.
The new turret or capstan lathe had a round or hexagonal block rotating about its axis and holding in a hole in each side the cutting or planing tool needed.
These tools could then at will be brought into contact with the metal to be finished, thus performing the work of six separate lathes in a much shorter time.
The turret block was made to turn automatically (1857) and finally Hartness invented the flat turret lathe, replacing the block by a horizontal face plate which gave the lathe greater flexibility and allowed work at higher speeds.
Such lathes ranged from the small types used by the watchmaker to those for processing large guns.
This development was completed by the introduction of high-speed tool steels by Taylor and White about the beginning of our century, making the machine lathe a universal tool for the mass production of machine parts.

## Factories and Industrial Revolution

This brought about a great change in the manufacturing process itself.
No longer were most commodities now made in the private shops of craftsmen, but in larger workshops in which a water wheel or a steam engine moved an axle from which smaller machinery derived its power by means of gear wheels or belts, each machine only partly processing the metal or material.
Hence the manufacturing process was split up into a series of operations, each of which was performed by a special piece of machinery instead of being worked by hand by one craftsman who mastered all the operations.

The modem factory arose only slowly.
Even in 1 800 the word `factory&#39; still denoted a shop, a warehouse, or a depot; the eighteenth century always spoke of `mills&#39; in many of which the prime mover still was a horse mill or tread mill.
The textile factory law of 1844 was the first to speak of `factories&#39;.

It is obvious that the new factories demanded a large outlay of capital.
The incessant local wars had impoverished central Europe and Italy and industry did not flourish there, so many German inventors left their country to seek their fortune in western Europe.
State control of the `manufactures&#39; in France had not been a success.
The French government had not created a new class of skilled labour along with the new engineers, and Napoleon&#39;s `self-supporting French industry&#39; was doomed to be a failure when overseas trade was re-established after his fall.
Neither the Low Countries nor Scandinavia had the necessary capital and raw materials needed for the Industrial Revolution.
Only in eighteenth-century England did such a fortunate combination of factors exist, a flourishing overseas trade, a well developed banking system, raw materials in the form of coal and iron ores, free trade and an industry-minded middle class willing to undertake the risks of introducing new machinery and recruiting the new skilled labour from the ranks of the farmers and immigrants from Ireland and Scotland.

Hence we find the first signs of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain rather than in France, which, however, soon followed suit.
Competition from Germany did not start until the middle of the nineteenth century, and from the United States not until the beginning of our century.

## The Beam Engines

The prime mover of this new industry was the steam engine.
The primitive machine that pumped water was transformed into a prime mover by the efforts of Newcomen and Watt.
Thomas Newcomen (1663-1729) and John Calley built a machine in which steam of 100 &deg;C moved a piston in its cylinder by condensation (1705).
This piston was connected with the end of a beam, the other end of which was attached to the rod of the pump or any other machine.
Most of these engines were used to drain mines.
John Smeaton (1724&ndash;92) studied the Newcomen engine and perfected it by measurement and calculation, changing its boiler and valves and turning it into the most popular steam engine up to 1800.

James Watt (1736-1819), trained as an instrument maker, heard the lectures of John Robison and Joseph Black at Edinburgh, where the new theory of heat was expounded and methods were discussed to measure the degree and the amount of heat, as well as the phenomena of evaporation and condensation.
He perceived that a large amount of heat was wasted in the cylinder of the Newcomen engine, heating it by injection of steam and cooling it by injecting cold water to condense the steam.
Hence he designed an engine in which the condensation took place in a separate condenser, which was connected with the cylinder by opening a valve at the correct moment, when the steam had forced the piston up (1763).


Watt tried to have his engine built at John Roebuck&#39;s Carron Iron Works in Scotland but did not find the skilled workmen there to make the parts.
So he moved southwards and started work at the works of Matthew Boulton, who built Roebuck&#39;s share in Watt&#39;s patents (1774).
At the nearby Bradley foundry of John Wilkinson, cylinders could be bored accurately and thus Watt produced his first large-scale engine in 1781.
The power output of the Watt engine proved to be four times that of a Newcomen engine.
It was soon used extensively to pump water in brine works, breweries, and distilleries.
Boulton and Murdock helped to advertise and apply Watt&#39;s engines.

## The Double-Acting Rotative Engine

However, Watt was not yet satisfied with these results.
His Patent of 1781 turned the steam engine into a universally efficient prime mover.
The rod on the other arm of the beam was made to turn the up-and-down movement of the beam into a rotative one, by means of the `sun and planet movement&#39; of a set of gear wheels connecting the rod attached to the end of the beam with the axle on which the driving wheels and belts were fixed which moved the machines deriving their energy from this axle.
A further patent of 1782 made his earlier engine into a double-acting one, that is a steam engine in which steam was admitted alternately on each side of the piston.
This succeeded only when Boulton and Watt had mastered the difficult task of casting and finishing larger and more accurate cylinders.
Watt also had to improve the connexion of the beam and the piston rod by means of his extended three-bar system (1784) which he called the `parallel movement&#39;.
He was also able to introduce a regulator which cut off the steam supply to the cylinder at the right moment and leaving the rest of the stroke to the expansion of the steam made better use of its energy.


In 1788 he designed his centrifugal governor which regulated the steam supply according to the load keeping constant the number of strokes of the piston per minute.
Six years later he added the steam gauge or indicator to his engine, a miniature cylinder and piston, connected with the main cylinder.
The small piston of this indicator was attached to a pen which could be made to indicate on a piece of paper the movements of the little piston and thus provide a control on the movements of the steam engine proper.
William Murdock (1754-1839), by inventing the sliding valves and the means of preparing a paste to seal off the seams between the cast iron surface of the machine parts, contributed much to the success of these engines as proper packing was not yet available.


By 1800 some 500 Boulton and Watt engines were in operation, 160 of which pumped water back on to water wheels moving machinery.
The others were mostly rotative engines moving other machinery and twenty-four produced blast air for iron furnaces, their average strength being 15&ndash;16 h.p.

## The Modern High-Pressure Steam Engine

The period 1800&ndash;50 saw the evolution of the steam engine to the front rank of prime movers.
This was achieved by building steam engines which could be moved by high-pressure steam of high temperature containing much more energy per pound than the steam of 100 &deg;C which moved the earlier Watt engines.
This was only possible by perfecting the manufacture of the parts of the steam engine, by better designing, and by the more accurate finishing and fit of such parts.


Jabez Carter Hornblower built the first `compound engine&#39;, in which the steam released from the first cylinder was
left to expand further in a second one. These compound engines did away with the Watt condenser, but could not yet compete seriously until high pressure steam was applied.
Richard Trevithick and Oliver Evans were the pioneers of the high-pressure engine, which meant more horse power per unit of weight of the steam engine.
This again meant lighter engines and the possibility of using them for road and water traffic.

Nor were properly designed steam engines possible until the theory of heat had been further elaborated and the science of thermodynamics formulated, the theory of gases studied, and more evidence produced for the strength of metals and materials at high temperatures.
Another important problem was the construction of boilers to produce the high-pressure steam.
The ancient beehive-shaped boilers of Watt&#39;s generation could not withstand such pressures.
Trevithick created the Cornish boiler (1812), a horizontal cylinder heated by an inner tube carrying the combustion gases through the boiler into the flue and adding to the fuel efficiency of the boilers.
The Lancashire boiler, designed by William Fairbairn (1844), had two tubes and became a serious competitor of the Cornish boiler.
Better grates for burning the coal fuel were designed such as the `travelling grate stoker&#39; of John Bodmer (1841), and more fuel was economized by heating the cold feed water of the boiler with flue gases in Green&#39;s economizer (1845).
Then multitubular boilers were built in the course of the nineteenth century, most of which were vertical boilers, the best known of which was the Babcock and Wilcox tubular boiler (1876).


Further factors helping to improve the design of high-pressure steam engines were the invention of the direct-action steam pump by Henry Worthington (1841), the steam hoist (1830), and James Nasmyth&#39;s steam hammer (1839).
In the meantime Cartwright (1797) and Barton (1797) had perfected metallic packing which ensure tight joints and prevented serious leakage.


Thus steam pressures rose from 3&ndash;5 atm in 1810 to about 5 or 6 atm in 1830, but these early high-pressure engines were still of the beam type.
Then came the much more efficient rotation engines in which the piston rod was connected with the driving wheel by means of a crank.
Though even the early American Corliss engine (1849) still clung to the beam design, John M&#39;Naught (1845) and E. Cowper (1857) introduced modern rotative forms, which came to stay.
Three-cylinder engines of this type were introduced by Brotherhood (1871) and Kirk (1874) and became very popular prime movers for steamships (1881).

Not until 1850 was the average output of the steam engines some 40 h.p., that is significantly more than the 15 h.p. windmill or water-wheel of the period.
Again the steam engine was not bound to sites where water or wind were constantly available, it was a mobile prime mover which could be installed where needed, for instance in iron works situated near coal fields and iron ores.
In 1700 Great Britain consumed some 3,000,000 tons of coal, mostly to heat its inhabitants.
This amount had doubled by 1800 because of the introduction of the steam engine, and by 1850 it has risen to 60,000,000 tons owing to the steam engine and the use of coke in metallurgy &hellip;
