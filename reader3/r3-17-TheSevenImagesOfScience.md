### Pure Thought and Practical Power

Each person&#39;s image of the role of science may differ in detail from that of the next, but all public images are in the main based on one or more of seven positions.
The first of these goes back to Plato and portrays science as an activity with double benefits: Science as pure thought helps the mind find truth, and science as power provides tools for effective action.
In book 7 of the Republic.
Socrates tells Glaucon why the young rulers in the Ideal State should study mathematics: &ldquo;This, then, is knowledge of the kind we are seeking, having a double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn the art of number, or he will not know how to array his troops; and the philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being &hellip;
This will be the easiest way for the soul to pass from becoming to truth and being.&rdquo;


The main flaw in this image is that it omits a third vital aspect.
Science has always had also a mythopoeic function&emdash;that is, it generates an important part of our symbolic vocabulary and provides some of the metaphysical bases and philosophical orientations of our ideology.
As a consequence the methods of argument of science, its conceptions and its models, have permeated first the intellectual life of the time, then the tenets and usages of everyday life.
All philosophies share with science the need to work with concepts such as space, time, quantity, matter, order, law, causality, verification, reality. Our language of ideas, for example, owes a great debt to statics, hydraulics, and the model of the solar system.
These have furnished powerful analogies in many fields of study.
Guiding ideas&emdash;such as conditions of equilibrium, centrifugal and centripetal forces, conservation laws, feedback, invariance, complementarity&emdash;enrich the general arsenal of imaginative tools of thought.


A sound image of science must embrace each of the three functions.
However, usually only one of the three is recognized.
For example, folklore often depicts the life of the scientist either as isolated from life and from beneficent action or, at the other extreme, as dedicated to technological improvements.


### Iconoclasm

A second image of long standing is that of the scientist as iconoclast.
Indeed, almost every major scientific advance has been interpreted&emdash;either triumphantly or with apprehension&emdash;as a blow against religion.
To some extent science was pushed into this position by the ancient tendency to prove the existence of God by pointing to problems which science could not solve at the time.
Newton thought that the regularities and stability of the solar system proved it &ldquo;could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.&rdquo;
and the same attitude governed thought concerning the earth&#39;s formation before the theory of geological evolution, concerning the descent of man before the theory of biological evolution, and concerning the origin of our galaxy before modern cosmology.
The advance of knowledge therefore made inevitable an apparent conflict between science and religion.
It is now clear how large a price had to be paid for a misunderstanding of both science and religion:
    to base religious beliefs on an estimate of what science cannot do is as foolhardy as it is blasphemous.


The iconoclastic image of science has, however, other components not ascribable to a misconception of its functions.
For example, Arnold Toynbee charges science and technology with usurping the place of Christianity as the main source of our new symbols.
Neo-orthodox theologians call science the &ldquo;self-estrangement&rdquo; of man because it carries him with idolatrous zeal along a dimension where no ultimate&emdash;that is, religious&emdash;concerns prevail.
It is evident that these views fail to recognize the multitude of divergent influences that shape a culture, or a person.
And on the other hand there is, of course, a group of scientists, though not a large one, which really does regard science as largely an iconoclastic activity.
Ideologically they are, of course, descendants of Lucretius, who wrote on the first pages of De renim naiiira, &ldquo;The terror and darkness of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the sun and glittering shafts of day.
but by the aspect and the law of nature: whose first principle we shall begin by thus stating, nothing is ever gotten out of nothing by divine power.&rdquo;
In our day this ancient trend h;is assumed political significance owing to the fact that in Soviet literature scientific teaching and atheistic propaganda are sometimes equated.


\subsectoin{Ethical Perversion}

The third image of science is that of a force which can invade, possess, pervert, and destroy man.
The current stereotype of the soulless, evil scientist is the psychopathic investigator of science fiction or the nuclear destroyer&emdash;immoral if he develops the weapons he is asked to produce, traitorous if he refuses.
According to this view, scientific morality is inherently negative.
It causes the arts to languish, it blights culture, and when applied to human affairs, it leads to regimentation and to the impoverishment of life.
Science is the serpent seducing us into eating the fruits of the tree of knowledge&emdash;thereby dooming us.


The fear behind this attitude is genuine but not confined to science: it is directed against all thinkers and innovators.
Society has always found it hard to deal with creativity, innovation, and new knowledge.
And since science assures a particularly rapid, and therefore particularly disturbing, turnover of ideas, it remains a prime target of suspicion.


Factors peculiar to our time intensify this suspicion.
The discoveries of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; science often lend themselves readily to widespread exploitation through technology. The products of technology&emdash;whether they are better vaccines or better weapons&emdash;have the characteristics of frequently being very effective, easily made in large quantities, easily distributed, and very appealing.
Thus we are in an inescapable dilemma&emdash;irresistibly tempted to reach for the fruits of science, yet, deep inside, aware that our metabolism may not be able to cope with this ever-in-creasing appetite.


Probably the dilemma can no longer be resolved, and this increases the anxiety and confusion concerning science.
A current symptom is the popular identification of science with the technology of superweapons.
The bomb is taking the place of the microscope, Wernher von Bruun.
the place of Einstein, as symbols for modern science and scientists.
The efforts to convince people that science itself can give man only knowledge about himself and his environment, and occasionally a choice of action, have been largely unavailing.
The scientist as sciences can take little credit or responsibility either for facts he discovers&emdash;for he did not create them&emdash;or for the uses others make of his discoveries, for he generally is neither permitted nor specially fitted to make these decisions.
They are controlled by considerations of ethics, economics, or politics and therefore arc shaped by the values and historical circumstances of the whole society.


There are other evidences of the widespread notion that science itself cannot contribute positively to culture.
Toynbee, for example, gives a list of &ldquo;creative individuals,&rdquo; from Xenophon to Hindenburg and from Dante to Lenin, but docs not include a single scientist.
I cannot forego the remark that there is a significant equivalent on the level of casual conversation.
For when the man in the street&emdash;or many an intellectual&emdash;hears that you are a physicist or mathematician, he will usually remark with a frank smile, &ldquo;Oh.
I never could understand that subject:&rdquo;;
while intending this as a curious compliment, he betrays his intellectual dissociation from scientific fields.
It is not fashionable to confess to a lack of acquaintance with the latest ephemera in literature or the arts, but one may even exhibit a touch of pride in professing ignorance of the structure of the universe or one&#39;s own body, of the behavior of matter or one&#39;s own mind.


### The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice

The last two views held that man is inherently good and science evil.
The next image is based on the opposite assumption&emdash;that man cannot be trusted with scientific and technical knowledge.
He has survived only because he lacked sufficiently destructive weapons: now he can immolate his world.
Science, indirectly responsible for this new power, is here considered ethically neutral.
But man, like the sorcerer&#39;s apprentice, can neither understand this tool nor control it.
Unavoidably he will bring upon himself catastrophe, partly through his natural sinfulness, and partly through his lust for power, of which the pursuit of knowledge is a manifestation.
It was in this mood that Pliny deplored the development of projectiles of iron for purposes of war:
    &ldquo;This last I regard as the most criminal artifice that has been devised by the human mind: for, as if to bring death upon man with still greater rapidity, we have given wings to iron and taught it to fly.
    Let us, therefore, acquit Nature of a charge that belongs to man himself.&rdquo;

When science is viewed in this plane â€” as a temptation for the mischievous savage&emdash;it becomes easy to suggest a moratorium on science, a period of abstinence during which humanity somehow will develop adequate spiritual or social resources for coping with the possibilities of inhuman uses of modern technical results.
Here I need point out only the two main misunderstandings implied in this recurrent call for a moratorium.


First, science of course is not an occupation, such as working in a store or on an assembly line, that one may pursue or abandon at will.
For a creative scientist, it is not a matter of free choice what he shall do.
Indeed it is erroneous to think of him as advancing toward knowledge; it is, rather, knowledge which advances towards him, grasps him, and overwhelms him Even the most superficial glance at the life and work of a Kepler, a Dalton. or a Pasteur would clarify this point.
It would be well if in his education each person were shown by example that the driving power of creativity is as strong and as sacred for the scientist as for the artist.


The second point can be put equally briefly.
In order to survive and to progress, mankind surely cannot ever know too much.
Salvation can hardly be thought of as the reward for ignorance.
Man has been given his mind in order that he may find out where he is, what he is, who he is, and how he may assume the responsibility for himself which is the only obligation incurred in gaining knowledge.


Indeed, it may well turn out that the technological advances in warfare have brought us to the point where society is at last compelled to curb the aggressions that in the past were condoned and even glorified.
Organized warfare and genocide have been practiced throughout recorded history, but never until now have even the war lords openly expressed fear of war.
In the search for the causes and prevention of aggression among nations, we shall, I am convinced, find scientific investigations to be a main source of understanding.

### Ecological Disaster


A change in the average temperature of a pond or in the salinity of an ocean may shift the ecological balance and cause the death of a large number of plants and animals.
The fifth prevalent image of science similarly holds that while neither science nor man may be inherently evil, the rise of science happened, as if by accident, to initiate an ecological change that now corrodes the only conceivable basis for a stable society, in the words o Jacques Maritain, the &ldquo;deadly disease&rdquo; science set off in society is &ldquo;the denial of eternal truth and absolute values.&rdquo;
The mam events leading to this state are usually presented as follows.
The abandonment of geocentric astronomy implied the abandonment of the conception of the earth as the center of creation and of man as its ultimate purpose.
Then purposive creation gave way to blind evolution.
Space, time, and certainty were shown to have no absolute meaning.
All a priori axioms were discovered to be merely arbitrary conveniences.
Modern psychology and anthropology led to cultural relativism.
Truth itself has been dissolved into probabilistic and indeterministic statements.
Drawing upon analogy with the sciences, liberal philosophers have become increasingly relativistic, denying either the necessity or the possibility of postulating immutable verities, and so have undermined the old foundations of moral and social authority on which a stable society must be built.


It should be noted in passing that many applications of recent scientific concepts outside science merely reveal ignorance about science.
For example, relativism in nonscientific fields is generally based on far fetched analogies.
Relativity theory, of course, does not find that truth depends on the point of view of the observer but, on the contrary, reformulates the laws of physics so that they hold good for every observer, no matter how he moves or where he stands.
Its central meaning is that the most valued truths in science are wholly independent of the point of view.
Ignorance of science is also the only excuse for adopting rapid changes within science as models for antitraditional attitudes outside science.
In reality, no field of thought is more conservative than science.
Each change necessarily encompasses previous knowledge.
Science grows like a tree, ring by ring.
Einstein did not prove the work of Newton wrong; he provided a larger setting within which some contradictions and asymmetries in the earlier physics disappeared.


But the image of science as an ecological disaster can be subjected to a more severe critique.
Regardless of science&#39;s part in the corrosion of absolute values, have those values really given us always a safe anchor?
A priori absolutes abound all over the globe in completely contradictory varieties.
Most of the horrors of history have been carried out under the banner of some absolutistic philosophy, from the Aztec mass sacrifices to the auto-da-f&eacute; of the Spanish Inquisition, from the massacre of the Huguenots to the Nazi gas chambers.
It is far from clear that any society of the past did provide a meaningful and dignified life for more than a small fraction of its members.
If, therefore, some of the new philosophies, inspired rightly or wrongly by science, point out that absolutes have a habit of changing in time and of contradicting one another, if they invite a re-examination of the bases of social authority and reject them when those bases prove false (as did the Colonists in this country), then one must not blame a relativistic philosophy for bringing out these faults.
They were there all the time.


In the search for a new and sounder basis on which to build a stable world, science will be indispensable.
We can hope to match the resources and structure of society to the needs and potentialities of people only if we know more about man.
Already science has much to say that is valuable and important about human relationships and problems.
From psychiatry to dietetics, from immunology to meteorology, from city planning to agricultural research, by far the largest part of our total scientific and technical effort today is concerned, indirectly or directly, with man&emdash;his needs, relationships, health, and comforts.
Insofar as absolutes are to help guide mankind safely on the long and dangerous journey ahead, they surely should be at least strong enough to stand scrutiny against the background of developing factual knowledge.

### Scientism

While the last four images implied a revulsion from science, scientism may be described as an addiction to science.
Among the signs of scientism are the habit of dividing all thought into two categories, up-to-date scientific knowledge and nonsense: the view that the mathematical sciences and the large nuclear laboratory offer the only permissible models for successfully employing the mind or organizing effort; and the identification of science with technology, to which reference was made above.


One main source for this attitude is evidently the persuasive success of recent technical work.
Another resides in the fact that we are passing through a period of revolutionary change in the nature of scientific activity&emdash;a change triggered by the perfecting and disseminating of the methods of basic research by teams of specialists with widely different training and interests.
Twenty years ago the typical scientist worked alone or with a few students and colleagues.
Today he usually belongs to a sizable group working under a contract with a substantial annual budget.
In the research institute of one university more than 1500 scientists and technicians are grouped around a set of multimillion-dollar machines: the funds come from government agencies whose ultimate aim is national defense.


Everywhere the overlapping interests of basic research, industry, and the military establishment have been merged in a way that satisfies all three.
Science has thereby become a large-scale operation with a potential for immediate and world-wide effects.
The results are a splendid increase in knowledge, and also side effects that are analogous to those of sudden and rapid urbanization&emdash;a strain on communication facilities, the rise of an administrative bureaucracy, the depersonalization of some human relationships.

To a large degree, all this is unavoidable.
The new scientific revolution will justify itself by the flow of new knowledge and of material benefits that will no doubt follow.
The danger&emdash;and this is the point where scientism enters&emdash;is that the fascination with the mechanism) of this successful enterprise may change the scientist himself and society around him.
For example, the unorthodox, often withdrawn individual, on whom most great scientific advances have depended in the past, does not fit well into the new system.
And society will be increasingly faced with the seductive urging of scientism to adopt generally what is regarded&emdash;often erroneously&emdash;as the pattern of organization of the new science.
The crash program, the breakthrough pursuit, the megaton effect are becoming ruling ideas in complex fields such as education, where they may not be applicable.


### Magic

Few nonscientists would suspect a hoax if it were suddenly announced that a stable chemical element lighter than hydrogen had been synthesized, or that a manned observation platform had been established at the surface of the sun.
To most people it appears that science knows no inherent limitations.
Thus, the seventh image depicts science as magic, and the scientist as wizard, dens ex machina, or oracle.
The attitude toward the scientist on this plane ranges from terror to sentimental subservience, depending on what motives one ascribes to him.
