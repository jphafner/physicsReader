As we all know, energy can be localized in space and time.
But the place where energy is localized may be different from the place where its use is desired, and thus mechanisms of transport of energy are of the greatest interest.


The transport of energy is achieved in only two ways.
The first involves the transport of matter; as matter is moved its kinetic energy and internal energy move with it.
The second method is more complicated and more interesting; it involves a wave process.
The wave carries energy and momentum, but there is no net transfer of mass.
There are many different types of waves, but the general nature of the events by which energy is carried by a wave is always the same.
A succession of oscillatory processes is always involved.
The wave is created by an oscillation in the emitting body; the motion of the wave through space is by means of oscillations; and the wave is absorbed by an oscillatory process in the receiving body.


Most waves are complex.
In this chapter we study the most simple types of waves, those for which the amplitude varies sinusoidally.

## Pulses
\label{sec:17.1}

Suppose that you are holding the end of a relatively long rope or coil spring and that the other end is fixed to the wall.
\footnote{
    It is best, of course, to hang the rope from the ceiling or lay it on a smooth table so that the rope does not sag under the action of gravity.
    We will draw the diagrams with the rope horizontal, as if there were no gravitational force.
}
If you raise your hand suddenly and bring it back to its original position, you will create a pulse which moves down the rope and is reflected back.
The sequence of events is indicated in Figure \ref{fig:17.1}.


Any individual point on the rope simply moves up and down as the pulse passes by.
It is obvious that the pulse moves with a certain velocity, and we might imagine that there is a certain energy and momentum associated with it, even though there is no transfer of mass.
Keep in mind the observation that the pulse is inverted after reflection from the wall.


Consider now another experiment with two ropes, one light and one heavy, attached to each other as in Figure \ref{fig:17.2}.
An incident pulse is sent along the light rope, and when it arrives at the
junction or interface it is partially transmitted and partially reflected.
The transmitted pulse is upright, and the reflected pulse is inverted.


<figure>
\label{fig:17.1}
\caption{
    This sequence of photographs shows a pulse traveling to the left on a long coil spring. h
    The pulse is reflected by the fixed end of the spring and the reflected pulse is inverted.

</figure>

<figure>
\label{fig:17.2}
\caption{
    An incident pulse is sent along the light rope toward the attached heavy rope.
    The pulse is partially transmitted and partially reflected.
    The reflected pulse is inverted as in Figure \ref{fig:17.1}.
}
</figure>


We can vary the two-rope experiment by sending the incident pulse along the heavy rope.
Part is transmitted and part reflected, but the reflected part is not inverted.
This is different from the case shown in Figure \ref{fig:17.3}, and we conclude that the type of reflection depends on the nature of the interface at which reflection occurs.


What happens when two pulses are sent along a rope and pass over each other?
If two equivalent pulses inverted with respect to each other are sent from opposite ends of the rope, they will seem to cancel each other when they meet, and at that instant the rope appears to be at rest.
A moment later the pulses have passed by each other with no evident change in shape.
Evidently one pulse can move along the rope quite independently of another, and when they meet the pulses are superimposed one on the other.


<figure>
\label{fig:17.3}
\caption{
    This is similar to Figure 17.2 but now the incident pulse is on the heavy rope.
    Again the pulse is partially reflected and partially transmitted.
    However the reflected pulse is not inverted.
    The nature of the reflected pulse will depend on the boundary which caused the reflection.
}
</figure>



<figure>
\label{fig:17.4}
\caption{
    Superposition implies that waves or pulses pass through one another with no interaction.
    The diagram shows a rope carrying two pulses.
    In (a) the pulses approach each other.
    In (b) they begin to cross, and the resultant rope shape is found by the addition of pulse displacements at each point along the rope.
    At the instant of time shown in (c) there will be no net displacement of the rope; if the pulse shapes are the same and their amplitudes are opposite there will be an instantaneous cancellation.
    In (c) the pulses move along with no change in shape or diminution of amplitude, just as if the other pulse had not existed.
}
</figure>


## Running Waves
\label{sec:17.2}

Let us supply a succession of pulses to our long rope, as in Figure \ref{fig:17.5}.
This is easily enough done by jerking the end of the rope up and down at regular intervals.
If the interval is long enough we would have a succession of separate pulses traveling along the rope.
Eventually, of course, these pulses will be reflected and will complicate the picture, but for the moment we can assume that no reflection has occurred.


<figure>
\label{fig:17.5}
\caption{We can send a succession of pulses along a long rope by jerking one end up and down.}
</figure>

Now suppose that we apply the pulses to the rope so that there is no interval between pulses.
The result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:17.6}.
This is obviously a special case, and we give it a special name.
We say that a wave is moving along the rope, and it is clear that the wave is composed of a specially applied sequence of pulses.
Such a wave is called a running or traveling wave.


<figure>
\label{fig:17.6}
\caption{
    Instead of sending isolated pulses along the rope as in Figure \ref{fig:17.5}, we move our hand up and down continuously. Now there is no interval of time between individual pulses, and we say that the rope is carrying a wave.
    The wave velocity is identical to the velocity of the individual pulses which make up the wave.
}
</figure>


A simple type of wave can be created by causing the end of the rope to move up and down in simple harmonic motion.
The sequence of events by which the wave was established is shown in Figure \ref{fig:17.7}.
The motion of the end of the rope causes the wave pulse to move along the rope with velocity <span class="math">c</span>.
As the wave pulse moves along, a point on the rope a distance <span class="math">l</span> from the end of the rope will also start into simple harmonic motion, but it will start at a time $\frac{l}{c}$ later than that of the end of the rope.


<figure>
\label{fig:17.7}
\caption{
    This sequence of drawings shows the means by which a wave is established along a rope.
    The left hand end moves up and down in simple harmonic motion.
    This causes the wave pulse to move along the rope with velocity <span class="math">c</span>.
    The frequency of the wave will be the same as the frequency of the event which started the wave.
}
</figure>


Consider Figure \ref{fig:17.8}.
Point <span class="math">A</span> has just completed one cycle of simple harmonic motion.
It started at $t=0$ and finished at $t = T$, where <span class="math">T</span> is the period.
If the amplitude of motion is <span class="math">a</span>, then the displacement in the <span class="math">y</span> direction of point <span class="math">A</span> can be represented by



<figure>
\label{fig:17.8}
\caption{
    This shows the wave form for one complete cycle of simple harmonic motion of the source.
    The wave moves in the <span class="math">x</span>-direction, and individual points on the rope move in the $\pm y$-directions. The wavelength x is the distance the wave travels for one complete cycle of the source.
    The wave amplitude is <span class="math">a</span>.
}
</figure>

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:17-1}
    y_A = a \sin\left( 2\pi f t \right)
\end{equation}


where <span class="math">f</span> is the frequency of the motion.
Now as point <span class="math">A</span> is just finishing one cycle and starting another, point <span class="math">B</span> is starting its first cycle.
If it is a distance $\lambda$ away from <span class="math">A</span>, it starts at time

\begin{equation*}
    t_B = \frac{\lambda}{c}
\end{equation*}

Another point on the curve, such as <span class="math">X</span>, had started at a time

\begin{equation*}
    t_X = \frac{X}{c}
\end{equation*}

With respect to point <span class="math">A</span>, the motion of point <span class="math">X</span> is delayed by a time <span class="math">t_X</span>.
We can see that the displacements of points <span class="math">B</span> and <span class="math">X</span> can be represented by

\begin{gather}
    y_B = a \sin 2\pi f \left( t - \frac{\lambda}{c} \right)
    y_x = a \sin 2\pi f \left( t - \frac{X}{c}  \right)
    \label{eq:17-2}
\end{gather}

Let us return for a moment to Figure \ref{fig:17.8}.
The distance $AB = X$, for one complete wave form, is called the wavelength.
If the wave has velocity <span class="math">c</span>, the time required for the wave to travel from <span class="math">A</span> to <span class="math">B</span> is $\frac{k}{c}$, and this will just equal the period of the simple harmonic motion associated with the wave.
That is,

\begin{equation*}
    T = \frac{\lambda}{c}
\end{equation*}


However


\begin{align*}
    T  &= \frac{1}{f} \\
       &= \frac{\lambda}{c}
\end{align*}

Thus

\begin{equation}
    \lambda f = c
    \label{eq:17-3}
\end{equation}

This very important relationship between wavelength, frequency and wave velocity holds for any type of wave.


We also have developed an equation which represents the wave.
For the wave moving in the positive <span class="math">x</span>-direction, the displacement of any point a distance <span class="math">x</span> from the origin is given by (\ref{eq:17-2}).


\begin{equation*}
    y = a \sin 2\pi f\left( t - \frac{X}{c} \right)
\end{equation*}

We can simplify this by noting that

\begin{equation*}
    \omega = 2 \pi f
\end{equation*}

and

\begin{equation*}
    f_t = \frac{l}{T} and \frac{f_X}{c} = \frac{X}{\lambda}
\end{equation*}


Thus we have

\begin{align*}
\label{eq:17-4}
    y &= a \sin \omega\left(t-\frac{X}{c}\right) \\
      &= a \sin 2\pi\left(\frac{t}{T}-\frac{X}{\lambda}\right)
\end{align*}

<em>Example</em>.
Two sources separated by 10 meters vibrate according to the equations $y_1 = 0.03\sin\pi t$ and $y_2 = 0.01\sin\pi t$.
They send out simple waves of velocity 1.5 m/sec.
What is the equation of motion of a particle 6 meter from the first source and 4 meters} from the second?

\begin{center}
    %% NOTE: add diagram
\end{center}

We suppose that source 1 sends out waves in the $+x$-direction,
\begin{equation*}
    y_1 = a_1 \sin 2\pi f_1\left( t - \frac{x_1}{c}\right)
\end{equation*}

and that source 2 sends out waves in the <span class="math">&minus;x</span>-direction,

\begin{equation*}
    y_2 = a_2\sin 2\pi f_2\left(t+\frac{x_1}{c}\right)
\end{equation*}



Then

\begin{align*}
    a_1 = 0.03\,\text{m} &  a_2=0.01\,\text{m} \\
    x_1 = 6\,\text{m}    &  x_2=-4\,\text{m} \\
    f_1 = f_2 = \frac{1}{2}\,\text{s}  & \\
    c = 1.5\,\text{m/s} & \\
\end{align*}

Thus

\begin{align*}
    y &= 0.03\sin\pi\left(t-4\right) \\
      &= 0.03\sin\pi\cos 4\pi - \cos\pi t\sin 4\pi \\
      &= 0.03\sin\pi t
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    y_2 &= 0.01\sin\pi\left(t-\frac{8}{3}\right) \\
        &= 0.01\left(\sin\pi t\cos\frac{8\pi}{3}-\cos\pi t\sin\frac{8\pi}{3}\right) \\
        &= 0.01\left(\sin\left(\frac{-\pi t}{2}\right) - \cos\frac{\pi t\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)
\end{align*}

The resultant wave motion is

\begin{align*}
    y &= yi+ y2  \\
      &= 0.03\sin\pi t - 0.005\sin\pi t - 0.00866\cos\pi t  \\
      &= 0.025\sin\pi - 0.00866\cos\pi t
\end{align*}

We will write this in the form

\begin{align*}
    y &= A\sin\left( \pi t+\phi\right) \\
      &= A\sin\pi t\cos\phi + A\cos\pi t\sin\phi
\end{align*}

## Standing Waves
\label{sec:17.3}

Suppose that we have a long rope with one wave train of angular frequency $\omega$ traveling in the $+x$-direction and another of the same frequency traveling in the <span class="math">&minus;x</span>-direction.
Both wave trains have the same amplitude, and we can write the general displacements as

\begin{align}
    y_+ = a \sin\omega\left(t-\frac{x}{c}\right) \\
    y_- = a \sin\omega\left(t+\frac{x}{c}\right)
    \label{eq:17-5}
\end{align}

These two wave trains are superimposed, so the net displacement is

\begin{align}
    y &= y_+ + y_- \\
      &= a\sin\omega\left(t-\frac{x}{c}\right) + a\sin\omega\left(t+\frac{x}{c}\right)
    \label{eq:17-6}
\end{align}

To simplify this we use the trigonometric relations

\begin{gather*}
    \sin\left(\theta+\phi\right) = \sin\theta\sin\phi + \cos\theta\cos\phi \\
    \sin\left(\theta-\phi\right) = \sin\theta\cos\phi - \cos\theta\sin\phi \\
\end{gather*}

Thus (\ref{eq:17-6}) is transformed to

\begin{equation}
    y = \left((2a\sin\omega t\right)\cos\frac{\omega x}{c}
    \label{eq:17-7}
\end{equation}

<figure>
\label{fig:17.9}
\caption{
    This sequence shows pictures of standing waves at intervals of $\frac{1}{4}T$, where $T=\frac{1}{f}$ is the period.
    At $f = 0$, $\frac{1}{2}T$, <span class="math">T</span> the displacement at all points is instantaneously zero.
    At intervals of $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ along the wave there are points called nodes for which the displacement is zero at all times.
}
</figure>


This is called a standing wave.
The amplitude is $2a\sin\omega t$, which varies with time and is zero at $t=0$, $t=\frac{1}{2}T$, and so forth.
The displacement on the rope will be zero for distances <span class="math">x</span>, where

\begin{gather}
    \frac{\omega x}{c} = \left( 2n-1 \right) \frac{\pi}{2}
    n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, &hellip;
    \label{eq:1708}
\end{gather}

Since $\omega = 2\pi f$, from (\ref{eq:17-7}), these points of zero displacement or nodes are located at
\begin{align}
    x &= \left(( 2n-1 \right) \frac{c}{\omega} \frac{\pi}{2} \\
      &= \left(( 2n-1 \right) \frac{c}{2\pi f} \frac{\pi}{2} \\
      &= \left(( 2n-1 \right) \frac{\lambda}{4}
\end{align}


The distance between two nodes will be, therefore, $\frac{n\lambda}{2}$ where $n = 1, 2, 3$, and so forth.

It is easy to see how standing waves can be created on a string which is fixed at one or at both ends.
One wave train is caused by the agency which causes the vibration, and the other wave train arises from a reflection at the fixed end.
Consider a string fixed at both ends. Both ends must be nodes, so that if the length of the string is <span class="math">l</span>, then by (\ref{eq:17-9})

<figure>
\label{fig:17.10}
\caption{
    A string of length <span class="math">l</span>, such as a violin string, is clamped at both ends.
    Both ends must be nodes if a standing wave is to be set up on the string.
    The maximum wavelength of the standing wave will be $\lambda = 2l$.
    The next possible standing wave will have a wavelength $\lambda=l$.
    Vibrations with wavelengths different from those of the standing waves will die out quickly.
}
</figure>


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-10}
    l = \frac{n\lambda}{2}
\end{equation}


The string can vibrate with wavelengths <span class="math">2l</span>, <span class="math">l</span>, $\frac{2l}{3}$, and so forth.
Vibrations with other wavelengths can be set up of course, but these die out very quickly.
The string will resonate to the wavelengths given by (\ref{eq:17-10}).


It is very important that the distinction between a running wave and a standing wave be kept in mind.
The running wave is illustrated in Figures \ref{fig:17.6} and \ref{fig:17.7}.
The wave disturbance moves in one direction only and each particle through which the wave passes suffers a sinusoidal variation of amplitude with time.
The standing wave, on the other hand, is a superposition of two running waves of the same frequency and amplitude, moving in opposite directions.
Certain points on the standing waves, the nodes, have a constant zero amplitude even though the two running waves are continually passing through these points.
Usually a standing wave is made by the superposition of an incident wave and the reflected wave from some boundary.


<em>Example</em>.
Standing waves are produced by the superposition of two waves

\begin{align*}
    y_1 &= 15\sin\left(3\pi t-5x\right) \\
    y_2 &= 15\sin\left(3\pi t+5x\right)
\end{align*}

Find the amplitude of motion at $x=2l$.
We use the relationships

\begin{align*}
    \sin\left(\alpha + \beta\right) &= \sin\alpha\cos\beta \pm \cos\alpha\sin\beta \\
    \sin\left(\alpha + \beta\right) &+ \sin\left(\alpha - \beta\right) = 2\sin\alpha\cos\beta
\end{align*}

Thus

\begin{equation*}
    y = y_1 + y_2 = 30\sin 3\pi t\cos 5x
\end{equation*}


With

\begin{align*}
    x=21 &, 5x &= 105\,\text{rad} \\
               &     &= 38.4\pi\,\text{rad} \\
\end{align*}

Now $\cos 38.4}\pi=\cos 0.4}\pi = \cos\ang{72}=0.309$

Thus the amplitude at $x=21$ is

\begin{align*}
    30\cos 38.4\pi &= 30\times 0.309  \\
                              &= 9.27
\end{align*}

## The Doppler Effect
\label{sec:17.4}

We wish now to study what happens when waves from a point source <span class="math">S</span>, which moves with velocity <span class="math">u</span>, are detected by an observer <span class="math">O</span> who moves with velocity <span class="math">v</span>.


Let the situation be as in Figure \ref{17.11}.
The velocities <span class="math">u</span> and <span class="math">v</span> are in the positive <span class="math">x</span>-direction.
The velocity of the waves emitted by <span class="math">S</span> is <span class="math">c</span>, and we can imagine two points <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> fixed in space equidistant from <span class="math">S</span> at $t=0$ such that a wave emitted at $t=0$ will just reach <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> at time $\tau$.
Thus at $t=0$

<figure>
\label{fig:17.11}
\caption{
    Waves are emitted by a point source <span class="math">S</span> moving with velocity <span class="math">u</span>, and detected by an observer <span class="math">O</span> moving with velocity <span class="math">v</span>.
    At $t=0$, points <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> are equidistant from <span class="math">S</span>.
    A spherical wave emitted from <span class="math">S</span> at $t=0$ will just reach <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> at time $t=T$.
}
</figure>

\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{dist} AS &= c\tau \\
    \mathrm{dist} BS &= c\tau  \\
    t &= 0
\end{align*}

But by time $\tau$, <span class="math">S</span> will have moved a distance <span class="math">ut</span>, and then

\begin{align*}
    \mathrm{dist} AS &= c\tau + u\tau  \\
    \mathrm{dist} BS &= c\tau - u\tau  \\
    t &= \tau
\end{align*}

If the frequency of the source is <span class="math">f_0</span>, it will have emitted <span class="math">f_0</span> wavefronts between $t=0$ and $t=\tau$.
Since the first wavefront reaches <span class="math">A</span> and <span class="math">B</span> at $t=\tau$, then <span class="math">f_0</span> wavefronts are contained in the distances <span class="math">AS</span> and <span class="math">BS</span>.
Thus the apparent wavelength in front of the source is


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-11}
    \lambda = \frac{BS}{f_0\tau} = \frac{c-u}{f_0}
\end{equation}

and the wavelength behind the source is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-12}
    \lambda^{\prime} = \frac{AS}{f_0\tau} = \frac{c+u}{f_0}
\end{equation}

Now the observer <span class="math">O</span> moves with velocity <span class="math">v</span>, and the speed of the waves relative to him is $c+v$.
Since he is behind the source he experiences waves of wavelength $\lambda^{\prime}$ at an apparent frequency <span class="math">f_0</span> given by


\begin{align}
\label{eq:17-13}
    f  &= \frac{c+v}{\lambda^{\prime}} \\
       &= \frac{c+v}{c+u} f_0
\end{align}

The various expressions can easily be altered if the source is moving in a direction opposite to that of the detector.


Most of us will have noticed the Doppler effect in the change in pitch of a horn or siren as it passes by.
The Doppler effect is a property of any wave motion, and is used, for example, by the police in the radar sets that are employed to apprehend speeding motorists.


<em>Example</em>.
A proposed police radar is designed to work by the Doppler effect using electromagnetic radiation of <span class="math">30</span> cm wavelength.
The radar beam is reflected from a moving car; the motion causes a change in frequency, which is compared with the original frequency to compute the speed.

\begin{center}
    %% NOTE: add picture
\end{center}

A car moves toward the radar at 65 mile/hr (31 m/s).
The wavelength of the beam emitted by the radar is

\begin{equation*}
    \lambda_0 = \frac{c}{f_0}
\end{equation*}

On time $\tau$ the source emits <span class="math">f_0</span> wavefronts, and these travel a distance $c\tau - v\tau$ before reflection.
Thus the wavelength of the reflected beam as seen by the car is

\begin{equation*}
    \lambda^{\prime} = \frac{c\tau - v\tau}{f_0\tau} = \frac{c-v}{f_0}
\end{equation*}


As seen by the stationary radar set this wave $\lambda^{\prime}$ reflected by the moving car has wavelength $\lambda&rdquo;$ and frequency $f_0&rdquo;$.


\begin{align*}
    f&rdquo; &= \frac{c}{\lambda&rdquo;} \\
        &= f_0 \frac{c-2v}{c}
\end{align*}


The fractional change in frequency is
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\Delta f}{f_0} = \frac{f_0-f^{\prime}}{f_0} = 1 - \frac{c-2v}{c} = \frac{2v}{c} &= \frac{62}{3\times 10^8} \\
                                                                                  &= 2.06\times 10^{-7}
\end{align*}

The frequency of <span class="math">30</span> cm radiation is

\begin{equation*}
    f_0 = \frac{c}{\lambda_0} = \frac{3\times 10^8}{0.3} = 10^{9}\,\text{s}^{-1}
\end{equation*}

Thus the change in frequency would be

\begin{align*}
    \Delta f &= 2.06\times 10^{-7}\times 10^{9} \\
             &= 206\,\text{cps}
\end{align*}

## Sound Waves
\label{sec:17.5}

Waves on a string are called transverse waves because the motion of the individual particles is perpendicular or transverse to the direction of motion of the wave.
Another type of wave is the longitudinal wave, where the motion of the particle is along the same line as the direction of motion of the wave.


Sound is a longitudinal wave which involves very small changes in density of the medium through which it is propagated.
That is, a sound is a train of pressure variations in a substance.
At any one point there is an oscillatory variation in pressure or density.
In a solid the velocity of sound is given by

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-14}
    c = \sqrt{\frac{E}{d}}
\end{equation}

where <span class="math">d</span> is the density and <span class="math">E</span> is Young&#39;s modulus (the ratio of stress to strain in the elastic region).
\footnote{
    See Section 27.5.
}

In a perfect gas the velocity of sound is given by

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-15}
    c = \sqrt{\frac{c_p p}{c_v d}}
\end{equation}


where again $d=\frac{m}{v}$ is the density of the gas.
Since $pV = RT$, we can see from (\ref{eq:17-15}) that $c\propto \sqrt{T}$.

Very interesting effects occur with sound waves when the source emitting the wave is moving faster than the velocity of sound.
For example, in Figure \ref{fig:17.12}, consider a source moving with speed $v>c$.
It moves from <span class="math">A</span> to <span class="math">B</span> in time <span class="math">&Delta;t</span> and from <span class="math">B</span> to <span class="math">C</span> in an equal time <span class="math">&Delta;t</span>.
When the body is at <span class="math">C</span> the wave emitted at <span class="math">B</span> has spread out as a sphere of radius $c\Delta t$.
Similarly the wave emitted at <span class="math">A</span> has spread out as a sphere of radius $2c\Delta t$.
All the waves emitted at previous times are enclosed within a cone, called the Mach cone, of angle $2\theta$, where $\sin\theta=\frac{c}{v}$.
The wave along this cone is called a shock wave because there is a finite difference of pressure across the front.
The ratio vie is called the Mach number, after the scientist who first proposed its use.
The cone of shock waves is called the Mach cone.

<em>Example</em>.
The index of refraction <span class="math">n</span> of a substance is the ratio of the velocity of light in a vacuum to the velocity of light in the substance, $n=\frac{c}{v}$.
If a high speed charged particle is sent with velocity <span class="math">u</span> through the substance, the ratio (the Mach number, as it were) $\frac{u}{v}$ can be greater than unity.
Then any radiation emitted by the particle is enclosed within a cone of angle $2\theta$ where

\begin{equation*}
    \sin\theta=\frac{v}{u}=\frac{c}{nu}
\end{equation*}

The velocity of the particle can be greater than the velocity of light in the medium (but never greater than the velocity of light in a vacuum).


The radiation emitted by the particle is known as Cherenkov radiation.
By measuring $\theta$, this phenomena finds useful application in the measurement of the velocities of charged particles.



## Energy Of Waves
\label{sec:17.6}

Let us return to the wave moving along a string.
The dis- placement of point <span class="math">x</span> at time <span class="math">t</span> is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:17-16}
    y = a\sin\omega\left(t-\frac{x}{c}\right)
\end{equation}

The velocity v of this point is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-17}
    v = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = a\omega\cos\omega\left(t-\frac{x}{c}\right)
\end{equation}

Now we suppose that the mass of a small element of the string at this point is <span class="math">m</span>; thus, the kinetic energy is

\begin{align*}
    T &= \frac{1}{2} mv^2 \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} ma^2 \omega^2 \cos^2\omega\left(t-\frac{x}{c}\right)
\end{align*}

The time average of the kinetic energy is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-19}
    T = \frac{1}{4} ma^2 \omega^2
\end{equation}

And finally we define an energy density as being the average kinetic energy per unit mass.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-20}
    \text{kinetic energy density} = \frac{1}{4} a^2 \omega^@
\end{equation}


Since the energy of the system is being transformed from kinetic to potential and back again, and since $T_{max}=V_{max}$ we can see that

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-20}
    \text{potential energy density} = \frac{1}{4} a^2 \omega^2
\end{equation}

Thus

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-20}
    \text{total energy density} = \frac{1}{2} a^2 \omega^2
\end{equation}

The energy density is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the frequency.


The same expression (\ref{eq:17-22}) holds for a sound wave.
The density d gives the mass per unit volume; thus, the total energy per unit volume is

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} d a^2 \omega^2
    \label{eq:17-23}
\end{equation}

We can now begin to perceive how energy is transported by waves.
By expending energy a source can cause a harmonic disturbance in a medium.
This disturbance is propagated through the medium by the influence that an individual particle has on other particles immediately adjacent to it.
The motion of the particle means that it has a certain amount of energy, part kinetic and part potential at any instant of time.
At some point energy is removed from the wave and presumably dissipated.
And to sustain the wave motion along the wave train, energy must be supplied by the source.

## Dispersion Of Waves
\label{sec:17.7}

We have discussed only the simplest type of waves, sinusoidal in form, and in the remainder of the book we will never have occasion to talk about more complicated waves.


In a simple wave, at a point in space there is a simple harmonic motion of mass or a sinusoidal variation of a field vector.
This local event may be parallel or perpendicular to the direction of the wave, from which arises the terms &ldquo;longitudinal&rdquo; or &ldquo;transverse&rdquo; waves.
The wave has a frequency <span class="math">f</span> and a wavelength $\lambda$.
The wave velocity <span class="math">c</span> is related to these by $c=\frac{f}{\lambda}$.


Strictly speaking, we should call this velocity the phase velocity, and give it another symbol $v_\phi$,.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-24}
    v_\phi = f \lambda
\end{equation}

This is because $v_\phi$, gives the velocity at which an event of constant phase is propagated along the wave.
For later use we will define another quantity, the wave vector modulus <span class="math">k</span>.

\begin{equation*}
    k = \frac{1}{2\pi\lambda}
\end{equation*}

Thus

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-25}
    v_\phi = \frac{\omega}{k}
\end{equation}


As might be expected, real waves are liable to be more complicated than the simple waves, and we might suppose that the real wave is a result of the superposition of many simple waves.
If the velocities of the simple waves vary with wavelength, what then is the velocity of the resultant wave and how is it related to wavelength?


For an example consider two simple waves of slightly different wavelengths $\lambda$ and $\lambda^{\prime}$ and velocities <span class="math">v</span> and $v^{\prime}$, but with the same amplitude.
For the resultant wave the displacement <span class="math">x</span> at time <span class="math">t</span> is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-26}
    y = a\sin\left(\omega t-kx\right) + a\sin\left(\omega^{\prime}t-k^{\prime}x\right)
\end{equation}

We can use the trigonometric identity
\begin{equation}
    \sin\alpha + \sin\beta = 2\sin\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}\cos\frac{\alpha-\beta}{2}
\end{equation}

Thus the displacement of <span class="math">y</span> becomes

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-27}
    y = 2a\sin\left[\left(\frac{\omega+\omega'}{2}\right)t-\left(\frac{k+k'}{2}\right)x\right]
          \cos\left[\left(\frac{\omega-\omega'}{2}\right)t-\left(\frac{k-k'}{2}\right)x\right]
\end{equation}

We will rewrite (\ref{eq:17-27}) as

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-28}
    y = 2a\sin\left(\omega_\phi t-k_\phi x\right) \cos\left(\omega_g t-k_g x\right)
\end{equation}

The individual waves correspond to the sine factor in (\ref{eq:17-27}) and (\ref{eq:17-28}) and the phase velocity is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-29}
    v_phi = \frac{\omega_\phi}{k_\phi} = \frac{\omega+\omega'}{k+k'} \approx \frac{\omega}{k}
\end{equation}

The cosine factor in (\ref{eq:17-27}) and (\ref{eq:17-28}) indicates that another wave is present with velocity

\begin{align}
    \label{eq:17-30}
    v_g = \frac{\omega_g}{k_g} &= \frac{\omega-\omega'}{k-k'}
        &= \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta k}
\end{align}

This is called the group velocity, using the terminology that the real wave is made up of a group of individual waves.
We know that $\omega=v_\phi k$, thus

\begin{align*}
    \Delta \omega &= \left( \omega - \Delta\omega \right) - \omega \\
                  &= \left( v_phi + \Delta v_\phi \right)\left(k+\Delta k \right) - v_phi k \\
                  &= v_phi \Delta k + k \Delta v_phi
\end{align*}

Therefore

\begin{align}
\label{eq:17-31}
    v_g &= \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta k}
        &= v_\phi + k \frac{\Delta v_\phi}{\Delta k}
\end{align}



The significance of this is that the group velocity is the velocity at which energy flows, and it is normally the only velocity that can be observed for a wave train.
Dispersion is said to occur when the phase velocity varies with wavelength, that is when $\frac{\Delta v_\phi}{\Delta k} \neq 0$.
If there is no dispersion the phase velocity is identical to the group velocity.

<em>Example</em>.
An atom emits a photon of green light $\lambda=5200\,\text{&Aring;}$ in $\tau=2\times 10^{-10}\,\text{s}$.
Estimate the spread of wavelengths in the photon.


We will consider the photon to be composed of a train of waves.
The length of the wave train is $c\tau = 3\times 10^{8}\times 2\times 10^{-10} = 0.06\,\text{m}$

To make the estimate we can suppose that the wave train is made up of waves with slightly different frequencies and wavelengths,

\begin{align*}
    y &= a\sin\left(\omega t-kx\right) + a\sin\left(\omega't - k'x\right)
      &= 2a\sin\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\omega+\omega'\right)t - \left(k+k'\right)x\right]
           \cos\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\omega-\omega'\right)t - \left(k-k'\right)x\right]
\end{align*}


The resultant wave has an overall frequency $\frac{1}{2}\left(\omega-\omega'\right)$ and an overall wave vector $\frac{1}{2}\left(k-k'\right)$.
Thus the length of the wave train is approximated by


\begin{equation*}
    2l = \frac{1}{2\pi \frac{1}{2} \left(k-k'\right)}
\end{equation*}
\begin{center}
    %% NOTE: add picture
\end{center}


Since $k =\frac{1}{2\pi k}$, $k'=\frac{1}{2\pi\lambda}$.
This length is given by

\begin{equation*}
    l = \frac{\lambda\lambda'}{\lambda-\lambda'}
\end{equation*}

We can write $\lambda'=\lambda+\Delta\lambda$, thus

\begin{equation*}
    l = \frac{\lambda^2}{\Delta \lambda}
\end{equation*}

and we calculated $l=0.06\,\text{m}$. Therefore

\begin{align*}
    \Delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda^2}{l} &= \frac{\left(0.52\times 10^{-6}\right)^2}{0.06} \\
                                         &= 4.5\times 10^{-12}\,\text{m} \\
                                         &= 4.5\times 10^{-2}\,\text{&Aring;}
\end{align*}


A similar estimate of $\Delta \lambda$ can be made using the uncertainty principle in the following way.
We use $\Delta E\Delta t \propto h$, and $E=hf$; thus

\begin{gather}
    h \Delta f \Delta t\propto h
    \Delta f \propto \frac{1}{\Delta t}
\end{gather}

Now $\lambda f = c$, therefore

\begin{equation*}
    \left( \lambda + \Delta \lambda\right) \left(f + \Delta f \right) - \lambda f = 0
\end{equation*}

which gives, in absolute values,
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda} = \frac{\Delta f }{f}
\end{equation*}

Thus $\Delta f \propto \frac{1}{\Delta t}$ reduces to

\begin{equation*}
    \Delta \lambda = \frac{\lambda}{f\Delta t} = \frac{\lambda^2}{c\Delta t}
\end{equation*}

which is the same as the expression used in the previous calculation.


## Spherical Waves
\label{sec:17.8}

So far we have talked about only waves on a rope, and clearly the rope was the medium which carried the wave.
Many waves are associated with a medium, but the existence of a medium is not essential to the existence of a wave; all we need is something that vibrates in simple harmonic motion.

Perhaps the most important types of waves are sound waves and electromagnetic waves.
A sound wave needs a medium to be transmitted, and the vibration consists of small oscillations in the density of the medium in the direction of propagation of the wave.
Thus a sound wave is classified as a longitudinal wave.
On the other hand, an electromagnetic wave needs no medium and consists of oscillation of electric and magnetic field vectors perpendicular to the direction of propagation.
It is classified, therefore, as a transverse wave.


<figure>
\label{fig:17.13}
\caption{
    A point source <span class="math">S</span> emits spherical waves.
    At time <span class="math">t_1</span>, the wavefront is a sphere of radius <span class="math">R_1</span>; at time <span class="math">t_2</span> the wavefront is a sphere of radius <span class="math">R_2</span>.
}
</figure>


For a rope the medium extends only along a rope; thus, the wave can be propagated only in that direction.
But a sound wave or an electromagnetic wave can be propagated in all directions at once.
Consider, as in Figure \ref{fig:17.13}, a small source <span class="math">S</span> of wave motion.
The wave front travels out in every direction from <span class="math">S</span>, and we can consider it to be spherical since no direction of propagation is preferred over another.


Suppose that the energy associated with the wavefront is <span class="math">E</span>.
This energy is distributed over the spherical wavefront of radius <span class="math">R</span>.
Thus the intensity
\footnote{
    Keep in mind that the intensity of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude; see Section \ref{sec:17.6}.
}
or energy density at a point is

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-32}
    I = \frac{E}{4\pi R^2}
\end{equation}

We can measure the intensity at two distances <span class="math">R_1</span> and <span class="math">R_2</span> from the source.
They will be

\begin{align*}
    I_1 &= \frac{E}{4\pi R^2_1} \\
    I_1 &= \frac{E}{4\pi R^2_2}
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:17-33}
    \frac{I_2}{I_1} = \frac{R_1^2}{R_2^2}
\end{equation}

That is, the intensity of a spherical wave varies inversely as the square of the distance from the wave source.
This inverse square law applies only to spherical waves, but can be used in an approximate way to estimate the variation in intensity of waves which are only approximately spherical.

## Huygens' Principle

In the last few sections we have talked about wavefronts without defining them carefully.
A small source <span class="math">S</span> of frequency <span class="math">f</span> can emit waves of wavelength $\lambda$ and velocity <span class="math">c</span>.
We can suppose that the source sends out wavefronts at time intervals $\frac{1}{f}$, and that these wavefronts are separated by a distance $\lambda$.

If we know the position of a wavefront at time <span class="math">t</span>, how do we find its position at time $t+\Delta t$?
This problem is solved by Huygens' principle, which states that every point on the wavefront at time <span class="math">t</span> can be considered to be the source of secondary spherical waves which have the same velocity as the original wave.
The wavefront at time $t + \Delta t$ is the envelope of these secondary waves.

<figure>
\label{fig:17.14}
\caption{
    If we know the position of a wavefront at time <span class="math">t</span>, we can find its position at time $t + \Delta t$ by Huygens' principle.
    Each point on the original wavefront is thought to emit a secondary spherical wavelet.
    In time <span class="math">&Delta;t</span> the wavelet will have a radius <span class="math">&Delta;t</span>, where <span class="math">c</span> is the wave velocity.
    The wavefront at time $t + \Delta t$ will be the envelope of all the secondary wavelets.
}
</figure>


This is a geometric principle, of course, and is best illustrated by a diagram.
In Figure \ref{fig:17.14}, <span class="math">AB</span> is a wavefront at time <span class="math">t</span>.
If the wave velocity is <span class="math">c</span>, then in time <span class="math">&Delta;t</span> a secondary wave will travel a distance $c\Delta t$.
The envelope of the secondary waves is <span class="math">AB</span>, which is therefore the position of the wavefront at time $t + \Delta t$.
