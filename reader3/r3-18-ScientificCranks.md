Cranks vary widely in both knowledge and intelligence.
Some are stupid, ignorant, almost illiterate men who confine their activities to sending &ldquo;crank letters&rdquo; to prominent scientists.
Some produce crudely written pamphlets, usually published by the author himself, with long titles, and pictures of the author on the cover.
Still others are brilliant and well-educated, often with an excellent understanding of the branch of science in which they are speculating.
Their books can be highly deceptive imitations of the genuine article&emdash;well-written and impressively learned. In spite of these wide variations, however, most pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in common.


First and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost total isolation from their colleagues.
Not isolation in the geographical sense, but in the sense of having no fruitful contacts with fellow researchers.
In the Renaissance, this isolation was not necessarily a sign of the crank.
Science was poorly organized.
There were no journals or societies.
Communication among workers in a field was often very difficult.
Moreover, there frequently were enormous social pressures operating against such communication.
In the classic case of Galileo, the Inquisition forced him into isolation because the Church felt his views were undermining religious faith.
Even as late as Darwin&#39;s time, the pressure of religious conservatism was so great that Darwin and a handful of admirers stood almost alone against the opinions of more respectable biologists.


Today, these social conditions no longer obtain.
The battle of science to free itself from religious control has been almost completely won.
Church groups still oppose certain doctrines in biology and psychology, but even this opposition no longer dominates scientific bodies or journals.
Efficient networks of communication within each science have been established.
A vast cooperative process of testing new theories is constantly going on&emdash;a process amazingly free (except, of course, in totalitarian nations) from control by a higher &ldquo;orthodoxy.&rdquo;
In this modern framework, in which scientific progress has become dependent on the constant give and take of data, it is impossible for a working scientist to be isolated.


The modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his part.
It is due, he claims, to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new ideas.
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Scientific journals today are filled with bizarre theories.
Often the quickest road to fame is to overturn a firmly-held belief.
Einstein&#39;s work on relativity is the outstanding example.
Although it met with considerable opposition at first, it was on the whole an intelligent opposition.
With few exceptions, none of Einstein&#39;s reputable opponents dismissed him as a crackpot.
They could not so dismiss him because for years he contributed brilliant articles to the journals and had won wide recognition as a theoretical physicist.
In a surprisingly short time, his relativity theories won almost universal acceptance, and one of the greatest revolutions in the history of science quietly took place.


It would be foolish, of course, to deny that history contains many sad examples of novel scientific views which did not receive an unbiased hearing, and which later proved to be true.
The pseudoscientist never tires reminding his readers of these cases.
The opposition of traditional psychology to the study of hypnotic phenomena (accentuated by the fact that Mesmer was both a crank and a charlatan) is an outstanding instance.
In the field of medicine, the germ theory of Pasteur, the use of anesthetics, and Dr. Semmelweiss&#39; insistence that doctors sterilize their hands before attending childbirth are other well known examples of theories which met with strong professional prejudice.


Probably the most notorious instance of scientific stubbornness was the refusal of eighteenth century astronomers to believe that stones actually fell from the sky.
Reaction against medieval superstitions and old wives&#39; tales was still so strong that whenever a meteor fell, astronomers insisted it had either been picked up somewhere and carried by the wind, or that the persons who claimed to see it fall were lying.
Even the great French Academie des Sciences ridiculed this folk belief, in spite of a number of early studies of meteoric phenomena.
Not until April 26, 1803, when several thousand small meteors fell on the town of L&#39;Aigle, France, did the astronomers decide to take falling rocks seriously.


Many other examples of scientific traditionalism might be cited, as well as cases of important contributions made by persons of a crank variety.
The discovery of the law of conservation of energy by Robert Mayer, a psychotic German physician, is a classic instance.
Occasionally a layman, completely outside of science, will make an astonishingly prophetic guess&emdash;like Swift&#39;s prediction about the moons of Mars (to be discussed later), or Samuel Johnson&#39;s belief (expressed in a letter, in 1781, more than eighty years before the discovery of germs) that microbes were the cause of dysentery.


One must be extremely cautious, however, before comparing the work of some contemporary eccentric with any of these earlier examples, so frequently cited in crank writings.
In medicine, we must remember, it is only in the last fifty years or so that the art of healing has become anything resembling a rigorous scientific discipline.
One can go back to periods in which medicine was in its infancy, hopelessly mixed with superstition, and find endless cases of scientists with unpopular views that later proved correct.
The same holds true of other sciences. But the picture today is vastly different.
The prevailing spirit among scientists, outside of totalitarian countries, is one of eagerness for fresh ideas.
In the great search for a cancer cure now going on, not the slightest stone, however curious its shape, is being left unturned.
If anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting questionable theses to be published, so they may be discussed and checked in the hope of finding something of value.
A few years ago a student at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton was asked how his seminar had been that day. He was quoted in a news magazine as exclaiming, &ldquo;Wonderful!
Everything we knew about physics last week isn&#39;t true!&rdquo;

Here and there, of course&emdash;especially among older scientists who, like everyone else, have a natural tendency to become set in their opinions&emdash;one may occasionally meet with irrational prejudice against a new point of view.
You cannot blame a scientist for unconsciously resisting a theory which may, in some cases, render his entire life&#39;s work obsolete.
Even the great Galileo refused to accept Kepler&#39;s theory, long after the evidence was quite strong, that planets move in ellipses.
Fortunately there are always, in the words of Alfred Noyes, &ldquo;The young, swift-footed, waiting for the fire,&rdquo; who can form the vanguard of scientific revolutions.


It must also be admitted that in certain areas of science, where empirical data are still hazy, a point of view may acquire a kind of cult following and harden into rigid dogma.
Modifications of Einstein&#39;s theory, for example, sometimes meet a resistance similar to that which met the original theory.
And no doubt the reader will have at least one acquaintance for whom a particular brand of psychoanalysis has become virtually a religion, and who waxes highly indignant if its postulates are questioned by adherents of a rival brand.


Actually, a certain degree of dogma&emdash;of pig-headed orthodoxy&emdash;is both necessary and desirable for the health of science.
It forces the scientist with a novel view to mass considerable evidence before his theory can be seriously entertained.
If this situation did not exist, science would be reduced to shambles by having to examine every new-fangled notion that came along. Clearly, working scientists have more important tasks.
If someone announces that the moon is made of green cheese, the professional astronomer cannot be expected to climb down from his telescope and write a detailed refutation.
&ldquo;A fairly complete textbook of physics would be only part of the answer to Velikovsky,&rdquo; writes Prof. Laurence J. Lafleur, in his excellent article on &ldquo;Cranks and Scientists&rdquo; {Scientific Monthly, Nov., 1951), &ldquo;and it is therefore not surprising that the scientist does not find the undertaking worth while.&rdquo;


The modern pseudo-scientist&emdash;to return to the point from which we have digressed&emdash;stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated.
He works in isolation.
He does not send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent.
In most cases the crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance to a significant study.
As a consequence, he finds himself excluded from the journals and societies, and almost universally ignored by the competent workers in his field.
In fact, the reputable scientist does not even know of the crank&#39;s existence unless his work is given wide-spread publicity through non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature.
The eccentric is forced, therefore, to tread a lonely way.
He speaks before organizations he himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may edit, and — until recently — publishes books only when he or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed privately.


A second characteristic of the pseudo-scientist, which greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward paranoia.
This is a mental condition (to quote a recent textbook) &ldquo;marked by chronic, systematized, gradually developing delusions, without hallucinations, and with little tendency toward deterioration, remission, or recovery.&rdquo;
There is wide disagreement among psychiatrists about the causes of paranoia.
Even if this were not so, it obviously is not within the scope of this book to discuss the possible origins of paranoid traits in individual cases.
It is easy to understand, however, that a strong sense of personal greatness must be involved whenever a crank stands in solitary, bitter opposition to every recognized authority in his field.


If the self-styled scientist is rationalizing strong religious convictions, as often is the case, his paranoid drives may be reduced to a minimum.
The desire to bolster religious beliefs with science can be a powerful motive.
For example, in our examination of George McCready Price, the greatest of modern opponents of evolution, we shall see that his devout faith in Seventh Day Adventism is a sufficient explanation for his curious geological views.
But even in such cases, an element of paranoia is nearly always present.
Otherwise the pseudoscientist would lack the stamina to fight a vigorous, single-handed battle against such overwhelming odds.
If the crank is insincere&emdash;interested only in making money, playing a hoax, or both&emdash;then obviously paranoia need not enter his make-up. However, very few cases of this sort will be considered.


There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-scientist&#39;s paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.

(1) He considers himself a genius.

(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant blockheads.
Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives. If they ignore him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels.

Consider the following quotation: &ldquo;To me truth is precious &hellip; I should rather be right and stand alone than to run with the multitude and be wrong &hellip;
The holding of the views herein set forth has already won for me the scorn and contempt and ridicule of some of my fellowmen.
I am looked upon as being odd, strange, peculiar &hellip;
But truth is truth and though all the world reject it and turn against me, I will cling to truth still.&rdquo;


These sentences are from the preface of a booklet, published in 1931, by Charles Silvester de Ford, of Fairfield, Washington, in which he proves the earth is flat.
Sooner or later, almost every pseudoscientist expresses similar sentiments.


(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against.
The recognized societies refuse to let him lecture.
The journals reject his papers and either ignore his books or assign them to &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; for review. It is all part of a dastardly plot.
It never occurs to the crank that this opposition may be due to error in his work.
It springs solely, he is convinced, from blind prejudice on the part of the established hierarchy&emdash;the high priests of science who fear to have their orthodoxy overthrown.


Vicious slanders and unprovoked attacks, he usually insists, are constantly being made against him.
He likens himself to Bruno, GaHleo, Copernicus, Pasteur, and other great men who were unjustly persecuted for their heresies.
If he has had no formal training in the field in which he works, he will attribute this persecution to a scientific masonry, unwilling to admit into its inner sanctums anyone who has not gone through the proper initiation rituals.
He repeatedly calls your attention to important scientific discoveries made by laymen.


(4) He has strong compulsions to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best-established theories.
When Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works in that science were violently anti-Newton.
Today, with Einstein the father-symbol of authority, a crank theory of physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton.
This same defiance can be seen in a tendency to assert the diametrical opposite of well-established beliefs.
Mathematicians prove the angle cannot be trisected.
So the crank trisects it.
A perpetual motion machine cannot be built. He builds one.
There are many eccentric theories in which the &ldquo;pull&rdquo; of gravity is replaced by a &ldquo;push.&rdquo;
Germs do not cause disease, some modern cranks insist.
Disease produces the germs. Glasses do not help the eyes, said Dr.  Bates. They make them worse.
In our next chapter we shall learn how Cyrus Teed literally turned the entire cosmos inside-out, compressing it within the confines of a hollow earth, inhabited only on the inside.


(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined.
Schizophrenics sometimes talk in what psychiatrists call &ldquo;neologisms&rdquo;&emdash;words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like Jabberwocky to everyone else.
Many of the classics of crackpot science exhibit a neologistic tendency.


When the crank&#39;s I.Q. is low, as in the case of the late Wilbur Glenn Voliva who thought the earth shaped like a pancake, he rarely achieves much of a following.
But if he is a brilliant thinker, he is capable of developing incredibly complex theories.
He will be able to defend them in books of vast erudition, with profound observations, and often liberal portions of sound science.
His rhetoric may be enormously persuasive.
All the parts of his world usually fit together beautifully, like a jig-saw puzzle.
It is impossible to get the best of him in any type of argument.
He has anticipated all your objections.
He counters them with unexpected answers of great ingenuity.
Even on the subject of the shape of the earth, a layman may find himself powerless in a debate with a flat-earther.
George Bernard Shaw, in Everybody&#39;s Political What&#39;s What?, gives an hilarious description of a meeting at which a flat-earth speaker completely silenced all opponents who raised objections from the floor.
&ldquo;Opposition such as no atheist could have provoked assailed him&rdquo;; writes Shaw, &ldquo;and he, having heard their arguments hundreds of times, played skittles with them, lashing the meeting into a spluttering fury as he answered easily what it considered unanswerable.&rdquo;


In the chapters to follow, we shall take a close look at the leading pseudo-scientists of recent years, with special attention to native specimens.
Some British books will be discussed, and a few Continental eccentric theories, but the bulk of crank literature in foreign tongues will not be touched upon.
Very little of it has been translated into English, and it is extremely difficult to get access to the original works.
In addition, it is usually so unrelated to the American scene that it loses interest in comparison with the work of cranks closer home.
